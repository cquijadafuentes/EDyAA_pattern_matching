Appendices I - XII                             PrefaceTHIS book is a slice of intensified history—history as I saw it. Itdoes not pretend to be anything but a detailed account of the NovemberRevolution, when the Bolsheviki, at the head of the workers andsoldiers, seized the state power of Russia and placed it in the handsof the Soviets.Naturally most of it deals with “Red Petrograd,” the capital and heartof the insurrection. But the reader must realize that what took placein Petrograd was almost exactly duplicated, with greater or lesserintensity, at different intervals of time, all over Russia.In this book, the first of several which I am writing, I must confinemyself to a chronicle of those events which I myself observed andexperienced, and those supported by reliable evidence; preceded by twochapters briefly outlining the background and causes of the NovemberRevolution. I am aware that these two chapters make difficult reading,but they are essential to an understanding of what follows.Many questions will suggest themselves to the mind of the reader. Whatis Bolshevism? What kind of a governmental structure did the Bolshevikiset up? If the Bolsheviki championed the Constituent Assembly beforethe November Revolution, why did they disperse it by force of armsafterward? And if the bourgeoisie opposed the Constituent Assemblyuntil the danger of Bolshevism became apparent, why did they championit afterward?These and many other questions cannot be answered here. In anothervolume, “Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk,” I trace the course of theRevolution up to and including the German  peace. There I explain theorigin and functions of the Revolutionary organisations, the evolutionof popular sentiment, the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, thestructure of the Soviet state, and the course and outcome of the Brest-Litovsk negotiations….In considering the rise of the Bolsheviki it is necessary to understandthat Russian economic life and the Russian army were not disorganisedon November 7th, 1917, but many months before, as the logical result ofa process which began as far back as 1915. The corrupt reactionaries incontrol of the Tsar’s Court deliberately undertook to wreck Russia inorder to make a separate peace with Germany. The lack of arms on thefront, which had caused the great retreat of the summer of 1915, thelack of food in the army and in the great cities, the break-down ofmanufactures and transportation in 1916—all these we know now were partof a gigantic campaign of sabotage. This was halted just in time by theMarch Revolution.For the first few months of the new régime, in spite of the confusionincident upon a great Revolution, when one hundred and sixty millionsof the world’s most oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty, boththe internal situation and the combative power of the army actuallyimproved.But the “honeymoon” was short. The propertied classes wanted merely apolitical revolution, which would take the power from the Tsar and giveit to them. They wanted Russia to be a constitutional Republic, likeFrance or the United States; or a constitutional Monarchy, likeEngland. On the other hand, the masses of the people wanted realindustrial and agrarian democracy.William English Walling, in his book, “Russia’s Message,” an account ofthe Revolution of 1905, describes very well the state of mind of theRussian workers, who were later to support Bolshevism almostunanimously:They (the working people) saw it was possible that even under a freeGovernment, if it fell into the hands of other social classes, theymight still continue to starve….The Russian workman is revolutionary, but he is neither violent,dogmatic, nor unintelligent. He is ready for barricades, but he hasstudied them, and alone of the workers of the world he has learnedabout them from actual experience. He is ready and willing to fight hisoppressor, the capitalist class, to a finish. But he does not ignorethe existence of other classes. He merely asks that the other classestake one side or the other in the bitter conflict that draws near….They (the workers) were all agreed that our (American) politicalinstitutions were preferable to their own, but they were not veryanxious to exchange one despot for another (i.e., the capitalistclass)….The workingmen of Russia did not have themselves shot down, executed byhundreds in Moscow, Riga and Odessa, imprisoned by thousands in everyRussian jail, and exiled to the deserts and the arctic regions, inexchange for the doubtful privileges of the workingmen of Goldfieldsand Cripple Creek….And so developed in Russia, in the midst of a foreign war, the SocialRevolution on top of the Political Revolution, culminating in thetriumph of Bolshevism.Mr. A. J. Sack, director in this country of the Russian InformationBureau, which opposes the Soviet Government, has this to say in hisbook, “The Birth of the Russian Democracy”: The Bolsheviks organisedtheir own cabinet, with Nicholas Lenine as Premier and Leon Trotsky—Minister of Foreign Affairs. The inevitability of their coming intopower became evident almost immediately after the March Revolution. Thehistory of the Bolsheviki, after the Revolution, is a history of theirsteady growth….Foreigners, and Americans especially, frequently emphasise the“ignorance” of the Russian workers. It is true they lacked thepolitical experience of the peoples of the West, but they were verywell trained in voluntary organisation. In 1917 there were more thantwelve million members of the Russian consumers’ Cooperative societies;and the Soviets themselves are a wonderful demonstration of theirorganising genius. Moreover, there is probably not a people in theworld so well educated in Socialist theory and its practicalapplication.William English Walling thus characterises them:The Russian working people are for the most part able to read andwrite. For many years the country has been in such a disturbedcondition that they have had the advantage of leadership not only ofintelligent individuals in their midst, but of a large part of theequally revolutionary educated class, who have turned to the workingpeople with their ideas for the political and social regeneration ofRussia….Many writers explain their hostility to the Soviet Government byarguing that the last phase of the Russian Revolution was simply astruggle of the “respectable” elements against the brutal attacks ofBolshevism. However, it was the propertied classes, who, when theyrealised the growth in power of the popular revolutionaryorganisations, undertook to destroy them and to halt the Revolution. Tothis end the propertied classes finally resorted to desperate measures.In order to wreck the Kerensky Ministry and the Soviets, transportationwas disorganised and internal troubles provoked; to crush the Factory-Shop Committees, plants were shut down, and fuel and raw materialsdiverted; to break the Army Committees at the front, capital punishmentwas restored and military defeat connived at.This was all excellent fuel for the Bolshevik fire. The Bolshevikiretorted by preaching the class war, and by asserting the supremacy ofthe Soviets.Between these two extremes, with the other factions which whole-heartedly or half-heartedly supported them, were the so-called“moderate” Socialists, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries,and several smaller parties. These groups were also attacked by thepropertied classes, but their power of resistance was crippled by theirtheories.Roughly, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries believed thatRussia was not economically ripe for a social revolution—that only a_political_ revolution was possible. According to their interpretation,the Russian masses were not educated enough to take over the power; anyattempt to do so would inevitably bring on a reaction, by means ofwhich some ruthless opportunist might restore the old régime. And so itfollowed that when the “moderate” Socialists were forced to assume thepower, they were afraid to use it.They believed that Russia must pass through the stages of political andeconomic development known to Western Europe, and emerge at last, withthe rest of the world, into full-fledged Socialism. Naturally,therefore, they agreed with the propertied classes that Russia mustfirst be a parliamentary state—though with some improvements on theWestern democracies. As a consequence, they insisted upon thecollaboration of the propertied classes in the Government.From this it was an easy step to supporting them. The “moderate”Socialists needed the bourgeoisie. But the bourgeoisie did not need the“moderate” Socialists. So it resulted in the Socialist Ministers beingobliged to give way, little by little, on their entire program, whilethe propertied classes grew more and more insistent.And at the end, when the Bolsheviki upset the whole hollow compromise,the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries found themselves fightingon the side of the propertied classes…. In almost every country in theworld to-day the same phenomenon is visible.Instead of being a destructive force, it seems to me that theBolsheviki were the only party in Russia with a constructive programand the power to impose it on the country. If they had not succeeded tothe Government when they did, there is little doubt in my mind that thearmies of Imperial Germany would have been in Petrograd and Moscow inDecember, and Russia would again be ridden by a Tsar….It is still fashionable, after a whole year of the Soviet Government,to speak of the Bolshevik insurrection as an “adventure.” Adventure itwas, and one of the most marvellous mankind ever embarked upon,sweeping into history at the head of the toiling masses, and stakingeverything on their vast and simple desires. Already the machinery hadbeen set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributedamong the peasants. The Factory-Shop Committees and the Trade Unionswere there to put into operation workers’ control of industry. In everyvillage, town, city, district and province there were Soviets ofWorkers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, prepared to assume the taskof local administration.No matter what one thinks of Bolshevism, it is undeniable that theRussian Revolution is one of the great events of human history, and therise of the Bolsheviki a phenomenon of world-wide importance. Just ashistorians search the records for the minutest details of the story ofthe Paris Commune, so they will want to know what happened in Petrogradin November, 1917, the spirit which animated the people, and how theleaders looked, talked and acted. It is with this in view that I havewritten this book.In the struggle my sympathies were not neutral. But in telling thestory of those great days I have tried to see events with the eye of aconscientious reporter, interested in setting down the truth.                                        J. R.    New York, January 1st 1919.                        Notes and ExplanationsTo the average reader the multiplicity of Russianorganisations-political groups, Committees and Central Committees,Soviets, Dumas and Unions-will prove extremely confusing. For thisreason I am giving here a few brief definitions and explanations.                        Political PartiesIn the elections to the Constituent Assembly, there were seventeentickets in Petrograd, and in some of the provincial towns as many asforty; but the following summary of the aims and composition ofpolitical parties is limited to the groups and factions mentioned inthis book. Only the essence of their programmes and the generalcharacter of their constituencies can be noticed....  1. _Monarchists,_ of various shades, _Octobrists,_ etc. Theseonce-powerful factions no longer existed openly; they either workedunderground, or their members joined the _Cadets,_ as the _Cadets_came by degrees to stand for their political programme.Representatives in this book, Rodzianko, Shulgin.  2. _Cadets._ So-called from the initials of its name,Constitutional Democrats. Its official name is "Party of the People'sFreedom." Under the Tsar composed of Liberals from the propertiedclasses, the _Cadets_ were the great party of _political_ reform,roughly corresponding to the Progressive Party in America. When theRevolution broke out in March, 1917, the _Cadets_ formed the firstProvisional Government. The _Cadet_ Ministry was overthrown in Aprilbecause it declared itself in favour of Allied imperialistic aims,including the imperialistic aims of the Tsar's Government. As theRevolution became more and more a _social economic_ Revolution, the_Cadets_ grew more and more conservative. Its representatives in thisbook are: Miliukov, Vinaver, Shatsky.  2a. _Group of Public Men._ After the _Cadets_ had become unpopularthrough their relations with the Kornilov counter-revolution, the_Group of Public Men_ was formed in Moscow. Delegates from the _Groupof Public Men_ were given portfolios in the last Kerensky Cabinet.The _Group_ declared itself non-partisan, although its intellectualleaders were men like Rodzianko and Shulgin. It was composed of themore "modern" bankers, merchants and manufacturers, who wereintelligent enough to realise that the Soviets must be fought bytheir own weapon-economic organisation. Typical of the _Group:_Lianozov, Konovalov.  3. _Populist Socialists,_ or _Trudoviki_ (Labour Group).Numerically a small party, composed of cautious intellectuals, theleaders of the Cooperative societies, and conservative peasants.Professing to be Socialists, the _Populists_ really supported theinterests of the petty bourgeoisie-clerks, shopkeepers, etc. Bydirect descent, inheritors of the compromising tradition of theLabour Group in the Fourth Imperial Duma, which was composed largelyof peasant representatives. Kerensky was the leader of the_Trudoviki_ in the Imperial Duma when the Revolution of March, 1917,broke out. The _Populist Socialists_ are a nationalistic party. Theirrepresentatives in this book are: Peshekhanov, Tchaikovsky.  4. _Russian Social Democratic Labour Party._ Originally MarxianSocialists. At a party congress held in 1903, the party split, on thequestion of tactics, into two factions-the Majority (Bolshinstvo),and the Minority (Menshinstvo). From this sprang the names"Bolsheviki" and "Mensheviki"-"members of the majority" and "membersof the minority." These two wings became two separate parties, bothcalling themselves "Russian Social Democratic Labour Party," and bothprofessing to be Marxians. Since the Revolution of 1905 theBolsheviki were really the minority, becoming again the majority inSeptember, 1917.  a. _Mensheviki._ This party includes all shades of Socialists whobelieve that society must progress by natural evolution towardSocialism, and that the working-class must conquer political powerfirst. Also a nationalistic party. This was the party of theSocialist intellectuals, which means: all the means of educationhaving been in the hands of the propertied classes, the intellectualsinstinctively reacted to their training, and took the side of thepropertied classes. Among their representatives in this book are:Dan, Lieber, Tseretelli.  b. _Mensheviki Internationalists._ The radical wing of the_Mensheviki,_ internationalists and opposed to all coalition with thepropertied classes; yet unwilling to break loose from theconservative Mensheviki, and opposed to the dictatorship of theworking-class advocated by the Bolsheviki. Trotzky was long a memberof this group. Among their leaders: Martov, Martinov.  c. _Bolsheviki._ Now call themselves the _Communist Party,_ inorder to emphasise their complete separation from the tradition of"moderate" or "parliamentary" Socialism, which dominates theMensheviki and the so-called Majority Socialists in all countries.The _Bolsheviki_ proposed immediate proletarian insurrection, andseizure of the reins of Government, in order to hasten the coming ofSocialism by forcibly taking over industry, land, natural resourcesand financial institutions. This party expresses the desires chieflyof the factory workers, but also of a large section of the poorpeasants. The name "Bolshevik" can _not_ be translated by"Maximalist." The Maximalists are a separate group. (See paragraph5b). Among the leaders: Lenin, Trotzky, Lunatcharsky.  d. _United Social Democrats Internationalists._ Also called the_Novaya Zhizn_ (New Life) group, from the name of the veryinfluential newspaper which was its organ. A little group ofintellectuals with a very small following among the working-class,except the personal following of Maxim Gorky, its leader.Intellectuals, with almost the same programme as the _MenshevikiInternationalists,_ except that the _Novaya Zhizn_ group refused tobe tied to either of the two great factions. Opposed the Bolsheviktactics, but remained in the Soviet Government. Other representativesin this book: Avilov, Kramarov.  e. _Yedinstvo._ A very small and dwindling group, composed almostentirely of the personal following of Plekhanov, one of the pioneersof the Russian Social Democratic movement in the 80's, and itsgreatest theoretician. Now an old man, Plekhanov was extremelypatriotic, too conservative even for the Mensheviki. After theBolshevik _coup d'etat, Yedinstvo_ disappeared.  5. _Socialist Revolutionary party._ Called _Essaires_ from theinitials of their name. Originally the revolutionary party of thepeasants, the party of the Fighting Organisations-the Terrorists.After the March Revolution, it was joined by many who had never beenSocialists. At that time it stood for the abolition of privateproperty in land only, the owners to be compensated in some fashion.Finally the increasing revolutionary feeling of peasants forced the_Essaires_ to abandon the "compensation" clause, and led to theyounger and more fiery intellectuals breaking off from the main partyin the fall of 1917 and forming a new party, the _Left SocialistRevolutionary party._ The _Essaires,_ who were afterward alwayscalled by the radical groups _"Right Socialist Revolutionaries,"_adopted the political attitude of the Mensheviki, and worked togetherwith them. They finally came to represent the wealthier peasants, theintellectuals, and the politically uneducated populations of remoterural districts. Among them there was, however, a wider difference ofshades of political and economic opinion than among the Mensheviki.Among their leaders mentioned in these pages: Avksentiev, Gotz,Kerensky, Tchernov, "Babuschka" Breshkovskaya.  a. _Left Socialist Revolutionaries._ Although theoretically sharingthe Bolshevik programme of dictatorship of the working-class, atfirst were reluctant to follow the ruthless Bolshevik tactics.However, the _Left Socialist Revolutionaries_ remained in the SovietGovernment, sharing the Cabinet portfolios, especially that ofAgriculture. They withdrew from the Government several times, butalways returned. As the peasants left the ranks of the _Essaires_ inincreasing numbers, they joined the _Left Socialist Revolutionaryparty,_ which became the great peasant party supporting the SovietGovernment, standing for confiscation without compensation of thegreat landed estates, and their disposition by the peasantsthemselves. Among the leaders: Spiridonova, Karelin, Kamkov,Kalagayev.  b. _Maximalists._ An off-shoot of the _Socialist Revolutionaryparty_ in the Revolution of 1905, when it was a powerful peasantmovement, demanding the immediate application of the maximumSocialist programme. Now an insignificant group of peasantanarchists.                        Parliamentary ProcedureRussian meetings and conventions are organised after the continentalmodel rather than our own. The first action is usually the electionof officers and the _presidium._  The _presidium_ is a presiding committee, composed ofrepresentatives of the groups and political factions represented inthe assembly, in proportion to their numbers. The _presidium_arranges the Order of Business, and its members can be called upon bythe President to take the chair _pro tem._  Each question (_vopros_) is stated in a general way and thendebated, and at the close of the debate resolutions are submitted bythe different factions, and each one voted on separately. The Orderof Business can be, and usually is, smashed to pieces in the firsthalf hour. On the plea of "emergency," which the crowd almost alwaysgrants, anybody from the floor can get up and say anything on anysubject. The crowd controls the meeting, practically the onlyfunctions of the speaker being to keep order by ringing a littlebell, and to recognise speakers. Almost all the real work of thesession is done in caucuses of the different groups and politicalfactions, which almost always cast their votes in a body and arerepresented by floor-leaders. The result is, however, that at everyimportant new point, or vote, the session takes a recess to enablethe different groups and political factions to hold a caucus.  The crowd is extremely noisy, cheering or heckling speakers,over-riding the plans of the _presidium._ Among the customary criesare: _"Prosim!_ Please! Go on!" _"Pravilno!"_ or _"Eto vierno!_That's true! Right!" _"Do volno!_ Enough!" _"Doloi!_ Down with him!"_"Posor!_ Shame!" and _"Teesche!_ Silence! Not so noisy!"                        Popular Organisations1. _Soviet._ The word _soviet_ means "council." Under the Tsar theImperial Council of State was called _Gosudarstvennyi Soviet._ Sincethe Revolution, however, the term _Soviet_ has come to be associatedwith a certain type of parliament elected by members of working-classeconomic organisations-the Soviet of Workers', of Soldiers', or ofPeasants' Deputies. I have therefore limited the word to thesebodies, and wherever else it occurs I have translated it "Council."  Besides the local _Soviets,_ elected in every city, town andvillage of Russia-and in large cities, also Ward _(Raionny)Soviets_-there are also the _oblastne_ or _gubiernsky_ (district orprovincial) _Soviets,_ and the Central Executive Committee of theAll-Russian _Soviets_ in the capital, called from its initials_Tsay-ee-kah._ (See below, "Central Committees").  Almost everywhere the _Soviets_ of Workers' and of Soldiers'Deputies combined very soon after the March Revolution. In specialmatters concerning their peculiar interests, however, the Workers'and the Soldiers' Sections continued to meet separately. The_Soviets_ of Peasants' Deputies did not join the other two untilafter the Bolshevik _coup d'etat._ They, too, were organised like theworkers and soldiers, with an Executive Committee of the All-RussianPeasants' _Soviets_ in the capital.  2. _Trade Unions._ Although mostly industrial in form, the Russianlabour unions were still called Trade Unions, and at the time of theBolshevik Revolution had from three to four million members. TheseUnions were also organised in an All-Russian body, a sort of RussianFederation of Labour, which had its Central Executive Committee inthe capital.  3. _Factory-Shop Committees._ These were spontaneous organisationscreated in the factories by the workers in their attempt to controlindustry, taking advantage of the administrative break-down incidentupon the Revolution. Their function was by revolutionary action totake over and run the factories. The _Factory-Shop Committees_ alsohad their All-Russian organisation, with a Central Committee atPetrograd, which co-operated with the Trade Unions.  4. _Dumas._ The word _duma_ means roughly "deliberative body." Theold Imperial Duma, which persisted six months after the Revolution,in a democratised form, died a natural death in September, 1917. The_City Duma_ referred to in this book was the reorganised MunicipalCouncil, often called "Municipal Self-Government." It was elected bydirect and secret ballot, and its only reason for failure to hold themasses during the Bolshevik Revolution was the general decline ininfluence of all purely _political_ representation in the fact of thegrowing power of organisations based on _economic_ groups.  5. _Zemstvos._ May be roughly translated "county councils." Underthe Tsar semi-political, semi-social bodies with very littleadministrative power, developed and controlled largely byintellectual Liberals among the land-owning classes. Their mostimportant function was education and social service among thepeasants. During the war the _Zemstvos_ gradually took over theentire feeding and clothing of the Russian Army, as well as thebuying from foreign countries, and work among the soldiers generallycorresponding to the work of the American Y. M. C. A. at the Front.After the March Revolution the _Zemstvos_ were democratized, with aview to making them the organs of local government in the ruraldistricts. But like the _City Dumas,_ they could not compete with the_Soviets._  6. _Cooperatives._ These were the workers' and peasants' Consumers'Cooperative societies, which had several million members all overRussia before the Revolution. Founded by Liberals and "moderate"Socialists, the Cooperative movement was not supported by therevolutionary Socialist groups, because it was a substitute for thecomplete transference of means of production and distribution intothe hands of the workers. After the March Revolution the_Cooperatives_ spread rapidly, and were dominated by PopulistSocialists, Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, and acted as aconservative political force until the Bolshevik Revolution. However,it was the _Cooperatives_ which fed Russia when the old structure ofcommerce and transportation collapsed.  7. _Army Committees._ The _Army Committees_ were formed by thesoldiers at the front to combat the reactionary influence of the oldregime officers. Every company, regiment, brigade, division and corpshad its committee, over all of which was elected the _ArmyCommittee._ The _Central Army Committee_ cooperated with the GeneralStaff. The administrative break-down in the army incident upon theRevolution threw upon the shoulders of the _Army Committees_ most ofthe work of the Quartermaster's Department, and in some cases, eventhe command of troops.  8. _Fleet Committees._ The corresponding organisations in the Navy.                        Central CommitteesIn the spring and summer of 1917, All-Russian conventions of everysort of organisation were held at Petrograd. There were nationalcongresses of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Soviets, TradeUnions, Factory-Shop Committees, Army and Fleet Committees-besidesevery branch of the military and naval service, Cooperatives,Nationalities, etc. Each of these conventions elected a CentralCommittee, or a Central Executive Committee, to guard its particularinterests at the seat of Government. As the Provisional Governmentgrew weaker, these Central Committees were forced to assume more andmore administrative powers.  The most important Central Committees mentioned in this book are:  _Union of Unions._ During the Revolution of 1905, ProfessorMiliukov and other Liberals established unions of professionalmen-doctors, lawyers, physicians, etc. These were united under onecentral organisation, the _Union of Unions._ In 1905 the _Union ofUnions_ acted with the revolutionary democracy; in 1917, however, the_Union of Unions_ opposed the Bolshevik uprising, and united theGovernment employees who went on strike against the authority of theSoviets.  _Tsay-ee-kah._ All-Russian Central Executive Committee of theSoviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. So called from theinitials of its name.  _Tsentroflot._ "Centre-Fleet"-the Central Fleet Committee.  _Vikzhel._ All-Russian Central Committee of the Railway Workers'Union. So called from the initials of its name.                        Other Organisations_Red Guards._ The armed factory workers of Russia. The _Red Guards_were first formed during the Revolution of 1905, and sprang intoexistence again in the days of March, 1917, when a force was neededto keep order in the city. At that time they were armed, and allefforts of the Provisional Government to disarm them were more orless unsuccessful. At every great crisis in the Revolution the _RedGuards_ appeared on the streets, untrained and undisciplined, butfull of Revolutionary zeal.  _White Guards._ Bourgeois volunteers, who emerged in the laststages of the Revolution, to defend private property from theBolshevik attempt to abolish it. A great many of them were Universitystudents.  _Tekhintsi._ The so-called "Savage Division" in the army, made upof Mohametan tribesmen from Central Asia, and personally devoted toGeneral Kornilov. The _Tekhintsi_ were noted for their blindobedience and their savage cruelty in warfare.  _Death Battalions._ Or _Shock Battalions._ The Women's Battalion isknown to the world as the _Death Battalion,_ but there were many_Death Battalions_ composed of men. These were formed in the summerof 1917 by Kerensky, for the purpose of strengthening the disciplineand combative fire of the army by heroic example. The _DeathBattalions_ were composed mostly of intense young patriots. Thesecame for the most part from among the sons of the propertied classes.  _Union of Officers._ An organisation formed among the reactionaryofficers in the army to combat politically the growing power of theArmy Committees.  _Knights of St. George._ The Cross of St. George was awarded fordistinguished action in battle. Its holder automatically became a_"Knight of St. George."_ The predominant influence in theorganisation was that of the supporters of the military idea.  _Peasants' Union._ In 1905, the _Peasants' Union_ was arevolutionary peasants' organisation. In 1917, however, it had becomethe political expression of the more prosperous peasants, to fightthe growing power and revolutionary aims of the Soviets of Peasants'Deputies.                        Chronology and SpellingI have adopted in this book our Calendar throughout, instead of theformer Russian Calendar, which was thirteen days earlier.  In the spelling of Russian names and words, I have made no attemptto follow any scientific rules for transliteration, but have tried togive the spelling which would lead the English-speaking reader to thesimplest approximation of their pronunciation.                        SourcesMuch of the material in this book is from my own notes. I have alsorelied, however, upon a heterogeneous file of several hundredassorted Russian newspapers, covering almost every day of the timedescribed, of files of the English paper, the _Russian Daily News,_and of the two French papers, _Journal de Russie_ and _Entente._ Butfar more valuable than these is the _Bulletin de la Presse_ issueddaily by the French Information Bureau in Petrograd, which reportsall important happenings, speeches and the comment of the Russianpress. Of this I have an almost complete file from the spring of 1917to the end of January, 1918.  Besides the foregoing, I have in my possession almost everyproclamation, decree and announcement posted on the walls ofPetrograd from the middle of September, 1917, to the end of January,1918. Also the official publication of all Government decrees andorders, and the official Government publication of the secrettreaties and other documents discovered in the Ministry of ForeignAffairs when the Bolsheviki took it over.                  Ten Days That Shook The World                              Chapter I                             BackgroundTOWARD the end of September, 1917, an alien Professor of Sociologyvisiting Russia came to see me in Petrograd. He had been informed bybusiness men and intellectuals that the Revolution was slowing down.The Professor wrote an article about it, and then travelled aroundthe country, visiting factory towns and peasant communities-where, tohis astonishment, the Revolution seemed to be speeding up. Among thewage-earners and the land-working people it was common to hear talkof "all land to the peasants, all factories to the workers." If theProfessor had visited the front, he would have heard the whole Armytalking Peace....The Professor was puzzled, but he need not have been; bothobservations were correct. The property-owning classes were becomingmore conservative, the masses of the people more radical.There was a feeling among business men and the _intelligentzia_generally that the Revolution had gone quite far enough, and lastedtoo long; that things should settle down. This sentiment was sharedby the dominant "moderate" Socialist groups, the _oborontsi_ (SeeApp. I, Sect. 1) Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, whosupported the Provisional Government of Kerensky.On October 14th the official organ of the "moderate" Socialists said:The drama of Revolution has two acts; the destruction of the oldrégime and the creation of the new one. The first act has lasted longenough. Now it is time to go on to the second, and to play it asrapidly as possible. As a great revolutionist put it, "Let us hasten,friends, to terminate the Revolution. He who makes it last too longwill not gather the fruits...."Among the worker, soldier and peasant masses, however, there was astubborn feeling that the "first act" was not yet played out. On thefront the Army Committees were always running foul of officers whocould not get used to treating their men like human beings; in therear the Land Committees elected by the peasants were being jailedfor trying to carry out Government regulations concerning the land;and the workmen (See App. I, Sect. 2) in the factories were fightingblack-lists and lockouts. Nay, furthermore, returning politicalexiles were being excluded from the country as "undesirable"citizens; and in some cases, men who returned from abroad to theirvillages were prosecuted and imprisoned for revolutionary actscommitted in 1905.To the multiform discontent of the people the "moderate" Socialistshad one answer: Wait for the Constituent Assembly, which is to meetin December. But the masses were not satisfied with that. TheConstituent Assembly was all well and good; but there were certaindefinite things for which the Russian Revolution had been made, andfor which the revolutionary martyrs rotted in their stark BrotherhoodGrave on Mars Field, that must be achieved Constituent Assembly or noConstituent Assembly: Peace, Land, and Workers' Control of Industry.The Constituent Assembly had been postponed and postponed-wouldprobably be postponed again, until the people were calmenough-perhaps to modify their demands! At any rate, here were eightmonths of the Revolution gone, and little enough to show for it....Meanwhile the soldiers began to solve the peace question by simplydeserting, the peasants burned manor-houses and took over the greatestates, the workers sabotaged and struck.... Of course, as wasnatural, the manufacturers, land-owners and army officers exerted alltheir influence against any democratic compromise....The policy of the Provisional Government alternated betweenineffective reforms and stern repressive measures. An edict from theSocialist Minister of Labour ordered all the Workers' Committeeshenceforth to meet only after working hours. Among the troops at thefront, "agitators" of opposition political parties were arrested,radical newspapers closed down, and capital punishment applied-torevolutionary propagandists. Attempts were made to disarm the RedGuard. Cossacks were sent to keep order in the provinces....These measures were supported by the "moderate" Socialists and theirleaders in the Ministry, who considered it necessary to cooperatewith the propertied classes. The people rapidly deserted them, andwent over to the Bolsheviki, who stood for Peace, Land, and Workers'Control of Industry, and a Government of the working-class. InSeptember, 1917, matters reached a crisis. Against the overwhelmingsentiment of the country, Kerensky and the "moderate" Socialistssucceeded in establishing a Government of Coalition with thepropertied classes; and as a result, the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries lost the confidence of the people forever.An article in _Rabotchi Put_ (Workers' Way) about the middle ofOctober, entitled "The Socialist Ministers," expressed the feeling ofthe masses of the people against the "moderate" Socialists:Here is a list of their services.(See App. I, Sect. 3)Tseretelli: disarmed the workmen with the assistance of GeneralPolovtsev, checkmated the revolutionary soldiers, and approved ofcapital punishment in the army.Skobeliev: commenced by trying to tax the capitalists 100% of theirprofits, and finished-and finished by an attempt to dissolve theWorkers' Committees in the shops and factories.Avksentiev: put several hundred peasants in prison, members of theLand Committees, and suppressed dozens of workers' and soldiers'newspapers.Tchernov: signed the "Imperial" manifest, ordering the dissolution ofthe Finnish Diet.Savinkov: concluded an open alliance with General Kornilov. If thissaviour of the country was not able to betray Petrograd, it was dueto reasons over which he had no control.Zarudny: with the sanction of Alexinsky and Kerensky, put some of thebest workers of the Revolution, soldiers and sailors, in prison.Nikitin: acted as a vulgar policeman against the Railway Workers.Kerensky: it is better not to say anything about him. The list of hisservices is too long....A Congress of delegates of the Baltic Fleet, at Helsingfors, passed aresolution which began as follows:We demand the immediate removal from the ranks of the ProvisionalGovernment of the "Socialist," the political adventurer-Kerensky, asone who is scandalising and ruining the great Revolution, and with itthe revolutionary masses, by his shameless political blackmail onbehalf of the bourgeoisie....The direct result of all this was the rise of the Bolsheviki....Since March, 1917, when the roaring torrents of workmen and soldiersbeating upon the Tauride Palace compelled the reluctant Imperial Dumato assume the supreme power in Russia, it was the masses of thepeople, workers, soldiers and peasants, which forced every change inthe course of the Revolution. They hurled the Miliukov Ministry down;it was their Soviet which proclaimed to the world the Russian peaceterms-"No annexations, no indemnities, and the right ofself-determination of peoples"; and again, in July, it was thespontaneous rising of the unorganised proletariat which once morestormed the Tauride Palace, to demand that the Soviets take over theGovernment of Russia.The Bolsheviki, then a small political sect, put themselves at thehead of the movement. As a result of the disastrous failure of therising, public opinion turned against them, and their leaderlesshordes slunk back into the Viborg Quarter, which is Petrograd's _St.Antoine._ Then followed a savage hunt of the Bolsheviki; hundredswere imprisoned, among them Trotzky, Madame Kollontai and Kameniev;Lenin and Zinoviev went into hiding, fugitives from justice; theBolshevik papers were suppressed. Provocators and reactionariesraised the cry that the Bolsheviki were German agents, until peopleall over the world believed it.But the Provisional Government found itself unable to substantiateits accusations; the documents proving pro-German conspiracy werediscovered to be forgeries; [*] and one by one the Bolsheviki were[*Part of the famous "Sisson Documents"]released from prison without trial, on nominal or no bail-until onlysix remained. The impotence and indecision of the ever-changingProvisional Government was an argument nobody could refute. TheBolsheviki raised again the slogan so dear to the masses, "All Powerto the Soviets!"-and they were not merely self-seeking, for at thattime the majority of the Soviets was "moderate" Socialist, theirbitter enemy.But more potent still, they took the crude, simple desires of theworkers, soldiers and peasants, and from them built their immediateprogramme. And so, while the _oborontsi_ Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries involved themselves in compromise with thebourgeoisie, the Bolsheviki rapidly captured the Russian masses. InJuly they were hunted and despised; by September the metropolitanworkmen, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet, and the soldiers, had beenwon almost entirely to their cause. The September municipal electionsin the large cities (See App. I, Sect. 4) were significant; only 18per cent of the returns were Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary,against more than 70 per cent in June....There remains a phenomenon which puzzled foreign observers: the factthat the Central Executive Committees of the Soviets, the CentralArmy and Fleet Committees, [*] and the Central Committees of some of[*See Notes and Explanations.]the Unions-notably, the Post and Telegraph Workers and the RailwayWorkers-opposed the Bolsheviki with the utmost violence. TheseCentral Committees had all been elected in the middle of the summer,or even before, when the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries hadan enormous following; and they delayed or prevented any newelections. Thus, according to the constitution of the Soviets ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies, the All-Russian Congress _shouldhave been called in September;_ but the _Tsay-ee-kah_ [*] would not[*See Notes and Explanations.]call the meeting, on the ground that the Constituent Assembly wasonly two months away, at which time, they hinted, the Soviets wouldabdicate. Meanwhile, one by one, the Bolsheviki were winning in thelocal Soviets all over the country, in the Union branches and theranks of the soldiers and sailors. The Peasants' Soviets remainedstill conservative, because in the sluggish rural districts politicalconsciousness developed slowly, and the Socialist Revolutionary partyhad been for a generation the party which had agitated among thepeasants.... But even among the peasants a revolutionary wing wasforming. It showed itself clearly in October, when the left wing ofthe Socialist Revolutionaries split off, and formed a new politicalfaction, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries.At the same time there were signs everywhere that the forces ofreaction were gaining confidence.(See App. I, Sect. 5) At theTroitsky Farce theatre in Petrograd, for example, a burlesque called_Sins of the Tsar_ was interrupted by a group of Monarchists, whothreatened to lynch the actors for "insulting the Emperor." Certainnewspapers began to sigh for a "Russian Napoleon." It was the usualthing among bourgeois _intelligentzia_ to refer to the Soviets ofWorkers' Deputies (Rabotchikh Deputatov) as _Sabatchikh_Deputatov-Dogs' Deputies.On October 15th I had a conversation with a great Russian capitalist,Stepan Georgevitch Lianozov, known as the "Russian Rockefeller"-aCadet by political faith."Revolution," he said, "is a sickness. Sooner or later the foreignpowers must intervene here-as one would intervene to cure a sickchild, and teach it how to walk. Of course it would be more or lessimproper, but the nations must realise the danger of Bolshevism intheir own countries-such contagious ideas as 'proletariandictatorship,' and 'world social revolution'... There is a chance thatthis intervention may not be necessary. Transportation isdemoralised, the factories are closing down, and the Germans areadvancing. Starvation and defeat may bring the Russian people totheir senses...."Mr. Lianozov was emphatic in his opinion that whatever happened, itwould be impossible for merchants and manufacturers to permit theexistence of the workers' Shop Committees, or to allow the workersany share in the management of industry."As for the Bolsheviki, they will be done away with by one of twomethods. The Government can evacuate Petrograd, then a state of siegedeclared, and the military commander of the district can deal withthese gentlemen without legal formalities.... _Or if, for example, theConstituent Assembly manifests any Utopian tendencies, it can bedispersed by force of arms...."_Winter was coming on-the terrible Russian winter. I heard businessmen speak of it so: "Winter was always Russia's best friend. Perhapsnow it will rid us of Revolution." On the freezing front miserablearmies continued to starve and die, without enthusiasm. The railwayswere breaking down, food lessening, factories closing. The desperatemasses cried out that the bourgeoisie was sabotaging the life of thepeople, causing defeat on the Front. Riga had been surrendered justafter General Kornilov said publicly, "Must we pay with Riga theprice of bringing the country to a sense of its duty?" [*][* See "Kornilov to Brest-Litvosk" by John Reed. Boni and LiverightN.Y., 1919]To Americans it is incredible that the class war should develop tosuch a pitch. But I have personally met officers on the NorthernFront who frankly preferred military disaster to cooperation with theSoldiers' Committees. The secretary of the Petrograd branch of theCadet party told me that the break-down of the country's economiclife was part of a campaign to discredit the Revolution. An Allieddiplomat, whose name I promised not to mention, confirmed this fromhis own knowledge. I know of certain coal-mines near Kharkov whichwere fired and flooded by their owners, of textile factories atMoscow whose engineers put the machinery out of order when they left,of railroad officials caught by the workers in the act of cripplinglocomotives....A large section of the propertied classes preferred the Germans tothe Revolution-even to the Provisional Government-and didn't hesitateto say so. In the Russian household where I lived, the subject ofconversation at the dinner table was almost invariably the coming ofthe Germans, bringing "law and order."... One evening I spent at thehouse of a Moscow merchant; during tea we asked the eleven people atthe table whether they preferred "Wilhelm or the Bolsheviki." Thevote was ten to one for Wilhelm...The speculators took advantage of the universal disorganisation topile up fortunes, and to spend them in fantastic revelry or thecorruption of Government officials. Foodstuffs and fuel were hoarded,or secretly sent out of the country to Sweden. In the first fourmonths of the Revolution, for example, the reserve food-supplies werealmost openly looted from the great Municipal warehouses ofPetrograd, until the two-years' provision of grain had fallen to lessthan enough to feed the city for one month.... According to theofficial report of the last Minister of Supplies in the ProvisionalGovernment, coffee was bought wholesale in Vladivostok for two rublesa pound, and the consumer in Petrograd paid thirteen. In all thestores of the large cities were tons of food and clothing; but onlythe rich could buy them.In a provincial town I knew a merchant family turnedspeculator_-maradior_ (bandit, ghoul) the Russians call it. The threesons had bribed their way out of military service. One gambled infoodstuffs. Another sold illegal gold from the Lena mines tomysterious parties in Finland. The third owned a controlling interestin a chocolate factory, which supplied the local Cooperativesocieties-on condition that the Cooperatives furnished him everythinghe needed. And so, while the masses of the people got a quarter poundof black bread on their bread cards, he had an abundance of whitebread, sugar, tea, candy, cake and butter.... Yet when the soldiers atthe front could no longer fight from cold, hunger and exhaustion, howindignantly did this family scream "Cowards!"-how "ashamed" they were"to be Russians"... When finally the Bolsheviki found and requisitionedvast hoarded stores of provisions, what "Robbers" they were.Beneath all this external rottenness moved the old-time Dark Forces,unchanged since the fall of Nicholas the Second, secret still andvery active. The agents of the notorious _Okhrana_ still functioned,for and against the Tsar, for and against Kerensky-whoever wouldpay.... In the darkness, underground organisations of all sorts, suchas the Black Hundreds, were busy attempting to restore reaction insome form or other.In this atmosphere of corruption, of monstrous half-truths, one clearnote sounded day after day, the deepening chorus of the Bolsheviki,"All Power to the Soviets! All power to the direct representatives ofmillions on millions of common workers, soldiers, peasants. Land,bread, an end to the senseless war, an end to secret diplomacy,speculation, treachery.... The Revolution is in danger, and with it thecause of the people all over the world!"The struggle between the proletariat and the middle class, betweenthe Soviets and the Government, which had begun in the first Marchdays, was about to culminate. Having at one bound leaped from theMiddle Ages into the twentieth century, Russia showed the startledworld two systems of Revolution-the political and the social-inmortal combat.What a revelation of the vitality of the Russian Revolution, afterall these months of starvation and disillusionment! The bourgeoisieshould have better known its Russia. Not for a long time in Russiawill the "sickness" of Revolution have run its course....Looking back, Russia before the November insurrection seems ofanother age, almost incredibly conservative. So quickly did we adaptourselves to the newer, swifter life; just as Russian politics swungbodily to the Left-until the Cadets were outlawed as "enemies of thepeople," Kerensky became a "counter-revolutionist," the "middle"Socialist leaders, Tseretelli, Dan, Lieber, Gotz and Avksentiev, weretoo reactionary for their following, and men like Victor Tchernov,and even Maxim Gorky, belonged to the Right Wing....About the middle of December, 1917, a group of SocialistRevolutionary leaders paid a private visit to Sir George Buchanan,the British Ambassador, and implored him not to mention the fact thatthey had been there, because they were "considered too far Right.""And to think," said Sir George. "One year ago my Governmentinstructed me not to receive Miliukov, because he was so dangerouslyLeft!"September and October are the worst months of the Russianyear-especially the Petrograd year. Under dull grey skies, in theshortening days, the rain fell drenching, incessant. The mudunderfoot was deep, slippery and clinging, tracked everywhere byheavy boots, and worse than usual because of the complete break-downof the Municipal administration. Bitter damp winds rushed in from theGulf of Finland, and the chill fog rolled through the streets. Atnight, for motives of economy as well as fear of Zeppelins, thestreet-lights were few and far between; in private dwellings andapartment-houses the electricity was turned on from six o'clock untilmidnight, with candles forty cents apiece and little kerosene to behad. It was dark from three in the afternoon to ten in the morning.Robberies and housebreakings increased. In apartment houses the mentook turns at all-night guard duty, armed with loaded rifles. Thiswas under the Provisional Government.Week by week food became scarcer. The daily allowance of bread fellfrom a pound and a half to a pound, then three quarters, half, and aquarter-pound. Toward the end there was a week without any bread atall. Sugar one was entitled to at the rate of two pounds a month-ifone could get it at all, which was seldom. A bar of chocolate or apound of tasteless candy cost anywhere from seven to ten rubles-atleast a dollar. There was milk for about half the babies in the city;most hotels and private houses never saw it for months. In the fruitseason apples and pears sold for a little less than a ruble apiece onthe street-corner....For milk and bread and sugar and tobacco one had to stand in _queue_long hours in the chill rain. Coming home from an all-night meeting Ihave seen the _kvost_ (tail) beginning to form before dawn, mostlywomen, some with babies in their arms.... Carlyle, in his _FrenchRevolution,_ has described the French people as distinguished aboveall others by their faculty of standing in _queue._ Russia hadaccustomed herself to the practice, begun in the reign of Nicholasthe Blessed as long ago as 1915, and from then continuedintermittently until the summer of 1917, when it settled down as theregular order of things. Think of the poorly-clad people standing onthe iron-white streets of Petrograd whole days in the Russian winter!I have listened in the bread-lines, hearing the bitter, acrid note ofdiscontent which from time to time burst up through the miraculousgoodnature of the Russian crowd....Of course all the theatres were going every night, including Sundays.Karsavina appeared in a new Ballet at the Marinsky, all dance-lovingRussia coming to see her. Shaliapin was singing. At the Alexandrinskythey were reviving Meyerhold's production of Tolstoy's "Death of Ivanthe Terrible"; and at that performance I remember noticing a studentof the Imperial School of Pages, in his dress uniform, who stood upcorrectly between the acts and faced the empty Imperial box, with itseagles all erased.... The _Krivoye Zerkalo_ staged a sumptuous versionof Schnitzler's "Reigen."Although the Hermitage and other picture galleries had been evacuatedto Moscow, there were weekly exhibitions of paintings. Hordes of thefemale _intelligentzia_ went to hear lectures on Art, Literature andthe Easy Philosophies. It was a particularly active season forTheosophists. And the Salvation Army, admitted to Russia for thefirst time in history, plastered the walls with announcements ofgospel meetings, which amused and astounded Russian audiences....As in all such times, the petty conventional life of the city wenton, ignoring the Revolution as much as possible. The poets madeverses-but not about the Revolution. The realistic painters paintedscenes from mediæval Russian history-anything but the Revolution.Young ladies from the provinces came up to the capital to learnFrench and cultivate their voices, and the gay young beautifulofficers wore their gold-trimmed crimson _bashliki_ and theirelaborate Caucasian swords around the hotel lobbies. The ladies ofthe minor bureaucratic set took tea with each other in the afternoon,carrying each her little gold or silver or jewelled sugar-box, andhalf a loaf of bread in her muff, and wished that the Tsar were back,or that the Germans would come, or anything that would solve theservant problem.... The daughter of a friend of mine came home oneafternoon in hysterics because the woman street-car conductor hadcalled her "Comrade!"All around them great Russia was in travail, bearing a new world. Theservants one used to treat like animals and pay next to nothing, weregetting independent. A pair of shoes cost more than a hundred rubles,and as wages averaged about thirty-five rubles a month the servantsrefused to stand in _queue_ and wear out their shoes. But more thanthat. In the new Russia every man and woman could vote; there wereworking-class newspapers, saying new and startling things; there werethe Soviets; and there were the Unions. The _izvoshtchiki_(cab-drivers) had a Union; they were also represented in thePetrograd Soviet. The waiters and hotel servants were organised, andrefused tips. On the walls of restaurants they put up signs whichread, "No tips taken here-" or, "Just because a man has to make hisliving waiting on table is no reason to insult him by offering him atip!"At the Front the soldiers fought out their fight with the officers,and learned self-government through their committees. In thefactories those unique Russian organisations, the Factory-ShopCommittees, [*] gained experience and strength and a realisation of[* See Notes and Explanations]their historical mission by combat with the old order. All Russia waslearning to read, and _reading-_politics, economics, history-becausethe people wanted to _know...._ In every city, in most towns, along theFront, each political faction had its newspaper-sometimes several.Hundreds of thousands of pamphlets were distributed by thousands oforganisations, and poured into the armies, the villages, thefactories, the streets. The thirst for education, so long thwarted,burst with the Revolution into a frenzy of expression. From SmolnyInstitute alone, the first six months, went out every day tons,car-loads, train-loads of literature, saturating the land. Russiaabsorbed reading matter like hot sand drinks water, insatiable. Andit was not fables, falsified history, diluted religion, and the cheapfiction that corrupts-but social and economic theories, philosophy,the works of Tolstoy, Gogol, and Gorky....Then the Talk, beside which Carlyle's "flood of French speech" was amere trickle. Lectures, debates, speeches-in theatres, circuses,school-houses, clubs, Soviet meeting-rooms, Union headquarters,barracks.... Meetings in the trenches at the Front, in village squares,factories.... What a marvellous sight to see Putilovsky Zavod (thePutilov factory) pour out its forty thousand to listen to SocialDemocrats, Socialist Revolutionaries, Anarchists, anybody, whateverthey had to say, as long as they would talk! For months in Petrograd,and all over Russia, every street-corner was a public tribune. Inrailway trains, street-cars, always the spurting up of impromptudebate, everywhere....And the All-Russian Conferences and Congresses, drawing together themen of two continents-conventions of Soviets, of Cooperatives,Zemstvos, [*] nationalities, priests, peasants, political parties; the[* See Notes and Explanations]Democratic Conference, the Moscow Conference, the Council of theRussian Republic. There were always three or four conventions goingon in Petrograd. At every meeting, attempts to limit the time ofspeakers voted down, and every man free to express the thought thatwas in him....We came down to the front of the Twelfth Army, back of Riga, wheregaunt and bootless men sickened in the mud of desperate trenches; andwhen they saw us they started up, with their pinched faces and theflesh showing blue through their torn clothing, demanding eagerly,"Did you bring anything to _read?"_What though the outward and visible signs of change were many, whatthough the statue of Catharine the Great before the AlexandrinskyTheatre bore a little red flag in its hand, and others-somewhatfaded-floated from all public buildings; and the Imperial monogramsand eagles were either torn down or covered up; and in place of thefierce _gorodovoye_ (city police) a mild-mannered and unarmed citizenmilitia patrolled the streets-still, there were many quaintanachronisms.For example, Peter the Great's _Tabel o Rangov-_Table of Ranks-whichhe rivetted upon Russia with an iron hand, still held sway. Almosteverybody from the school-boy up wore his prescribed uniform, withthe insignia of the Emperor on button and shoulder-strap. Along aboutfive o'clock in the afternoon the streets were full of subdued oldgentlemen in uniform, with portfolios, going home from work in thehuge, barrack-like Ministries or Government institutions, calculatingperhaps how great a mortality among their superiors would advancethem to the coveted _tchin_ (rank) of Collegiate Assessor, or PrivyCouncillor, with the prospect of retirement on a comfortable pension,and possibly the Cross of St. Anne....There is the story of Senator Sokolov, who in full tide of Revolutioncame to a meeting of the Senate one day in civilian clothes, and wasnot admitted because he did not wear the prescribed livery of theTsar's service!It was against this background of a whole nation in ferment anddisintegration that the pageant of the Rising of the Russian Massesunrolled....                              Chapter II                          The Coming StormIN September General Kornilov marched on Petrograd to make himselfmilitary dictator of Russia. Behind him was suddenly revealed themailed fist of the bourgeoisie, boldly attempting to crush theRevolution. Some of the Socialist Ministers were implicated; evenKerensky was under suspicion. (See App. II, Sect. 1) Savinkov,summoned to explain to the Central Committee of his party, theSocialist Revolutionaries, refused and was expelled. Kornilov wasarrested by the Soldiers' Committees. Generals were dismissed,Ministers suspended from their functions, and the Cabinet fell.Kerensky tried to form a new Government, including the Cadets, partyof the bourgeoisie. His party, the Socialist Revolutionaries,ordered him to exclude the Cadets. Kerensky declined to obey, andthreatened to resign from the Cabinet if the Socialists insisted.However, popular feeling ran so high that for the moment he did notdare oppose it, and a temporary Directorate of Five of the oldMinisters, with Kerensky at the head, assumed the power until thequestion should be settled.The Kornilov affair drew together all the Socialistgroups-"moderates" as well as revolutionists-in a passionate impulseof self-defence. There must be no more Kornilovs. A new Governmentmust be created, responsible to the elements supporting theRevolution. So the _Tsay-ee-kah_ invited the popular organisationsto send delegates to a Democratic Conference, which should meet atPetrograd in September.In the _Tsay-ee-kah_ three factions immediately appeared. TheBolsheviki demanded that the All-Russian Congress of Soviets besummoned, and that they take over the power. The "centre" SocialistRevolutionaries, led by Tchernov, joined with the Left SocialistRevolutionaries, led by Kamkov and Spiridonova, the MenshevikiInternationalists under Martov, and the "centre" Mensheviki, [*][* See Notes and Explanations.]represented by Bogdanov and Skobeliev, in demanding a purelySocialist Government. Tseretelli, Dan and Lieber, at the head of theright wing Mensheviki, and the right Socialist Revolutionaries underAvksentiev and Gotz, insisted that the propertied classes must berepresented in the new Government.Almost immediately the Bolsheviki won a majority in the PetrogradSoviet, and the Soviets of Moscow, Kiev, Odessa and other citiesfollowed suit.Alarmed, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries in control ofthe _Tsay-ee-kah_ decided that after all they feared the danger ofKornilov less than the danger of Lenin. They revised the plan ofrepresentation in the Democratic Conference, (See App. II, Sect. 2)admitting more delegates from the Cooperative Societies and otherconservative bodies. Even this packed assembly at first voted for a_Coalition Government without the Cadets._ Only Kerensky's openthreat of resignation, and the alarming cries of the "moderate"Socialists that "the Republic is in danger" persuaded theConference, by a small majority, to declare in favour of theprinciple of coalition with the bourgeoisie, and to sanction theestablishment of a sort of consultative Parliament, without anylegislative power, called the Provisional Council of the RussianRepublic. In the new Ministry the propertied classes practicallycontrolled, and in the Council of the Russian Republic they occupieda disproportionate number of seats.The fact is that the _Tsay-ee-kah_ no longer represented the rankand file of the Soviets, and had illegally refused to call anotherAll-Russian Congress of Soviets, due in September. It had nointention of calling this Congress or of allowing it to be called.Its official organ, _Izviestia_ (News), began to hint that thefunction of the Soviets was nearly at an end, (See App. II, Sect. 3)and that they might soon be dissolved... At this time, too, the newGovernment announced as part of its policy the liquidation of"irresponsible organisations"-i.e. the Soviets.The Bolsheviki responded by summoning the All-Russian Soviets tomeet at Petrograd on November 2, and take over the Government ofRussia. At the same time they withdrew from the Council of theRussian Republic, stating that they would not participate in a"Government of Treason to the People." (See App. II, Sect. 4)The withdrawal of the Bolsheviki, however, did not bringtranquillity to the ill-fated Council. The propertied classes, nowin a position of power, became arrogant. The Cadets declared thatthe Government had no legal right to declare Russia a republic. Theydemanded stern measures in the Army and Navy to destroy theSoldiers' and Sailors' Committees, and denounced the Soviets. On theother side of the chamber the Mensheviki Internationalists and theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries advocated immediate peace, land tothe peasants, and workers' control of industry-practically theBolshevik programme.I heard Martov's speech in answer to the Cadets. Stooped over thedesk of the tribune like the mortally sick man he was, and speakingin a voice so hoarse it could hardly be heard, he shook his fingertoward the right benches:"You call us defeatists; but the real defeatists are those who waitfor a more propitious moment to conclude peace, insist uponpostponing peace until later, until nothing is left of the Russianarmy, until Russia becomes the subject of bargaining between thedifferent imperialist groups.... You are trying to impose upon theRussian people a policy dictated by the interests of thebourgeoisie. The question of peace should be raised without delay....You will see then that not in vain has been the work of those whomyou call German agents, of those Zimmerwaldists [*] who in all the[* Members of the revoloutionary internationalist wing of theSocialists of Europe, so-called because of their participationin the International Conference held at Zimmerwald, Switzerland,in 1915]lands have prepared the awakening of the conscience of thedemocratic masses...."Between these two groups the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries wavered, irresistibly forced to the left by thepressure of the rising dissatisfaction of the masses. Deep hostilitydivided the chamber into irreconcilable groups.This was the situation when the long-awaited announcement of theAllied Conference in Paris brought up the burning question offoreign policy....Theoretically all Socialist parties in Russia were in favour of theearliest possible peace on democratic terms. As long ago as May,1917, the Petrograd Soviet, then under control of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries,had proclaimed the famous Russianpeace-conditions. They had demanded that the Allies hold aconference to discuss war-aims. This conference had been promisedfor August; then postponed until September; then until October; andnow it was fixed for November 10th.The Provisional Government suggested two representatives-GeneralAlexeyev, reactionary military man, and Terestchenko, Minister ofForeign Affairs. The Soviets chose Skobeliev to speak for them anddrew up a manifesto, the famous _nakaz_- (See App. II, Sect. 5)instructions. The Provisional Government  objected to Skobeliev andhis _nakaz;_ the Allied ambassadors protested and finally Bonar Lawin the British House of Commons, in answer to a question, respondedcoldly, "As far as I know the Paris Conference will not discuss theaims of the war at all, but only the methods of conducting it...."At this the conservative Russian press was jubilant, and theBolsheviki cried, "See where the compromising tactics of theMensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries have led them!"Along a thousand miles of front the millions of men in Russia'sarmies stirred like the sea rising, pouring into the capital theirhundreds upon hundreds of delegations, crying "Peace! Peace!"I went across the river to the Cirque Moderne, to one of the greatpopular meetings which occurred all over the city, more numerousnight after night. The bare, gloomy amphitheatre, lit by five tinylights hanging from a thin wire, was packed from the ring up thesteep sweep of grimy benches to the very roof-soldiers, sailors,workmen, women, all listening as if their lives depended upon it. Asoldier was speaking-from the Five Hundred and Forty-eight Division,wherever and whatever that was:"Comrades," he cried, and there was real anguish in his drawn faceand despairing gestures. "The people at the top are always callingupon us to sacrifice more, sacrifice more, while those who haveeverything are left unmolested."We are at war with Germany. Would we invite German generals toserve on our Staff? Well we're at war with the capitalists too, andyet we invite them into our Government...."The soldier says, 'Show me what I am fighting for. Is itConstantinople, or is it free Russia? Is it the democracy, or is itthe capitalist plunderers? If you can prove to me that I amdefending the Revolution then I'll go out and fight without capitalpunishment to force me.'"When the land belongs to the peasants, and the factories to theworkers, and the power to the Soviets, then we'll know we havesomething to fight for, and we'll fight for it!"In the barracks, the factories, on the street-corners, end lesssoldier speakers, all clamouring for an end to the war, declaringthat if the Government did not make an energetic effort to getpeace, the army would leave the trenches and go home.The spokesman for the Eighth Army:"We are weak, we have only a few men left in each company. They mustgive us food and boots and reinforcements, or soon there will beleft only empty trenches. Peace or supplies... either let theGovernment end the war or support the Army...."For the Forty-sixth Siberian Artillery:"The officers will not work with our Committees, they betray us tothe enemy, they apply the death penalty to our agitators; and thecounter-revolutionary Government supports them. We thought that theRevolution would bring peace. But now the Government forbids us evento talk of such things, and at the same time doesn't give us enoughfood to live on, or enough ammunition to fight with...."From Europe came rumours of peace at the expense of Russia. (SeeApp. II, Sect. 6)...News of the treatment of Russian troops in France added to thediscontent. The First Brigade had tried to replace its officers withSoldiers' Committees, like their comrades at home, and had refusedan order to go to Salonika, demanding to be sent to Russia. They hadbeen surrounded and starved, and then fired on by artillery, andmany killed. (See App. II, Sect. 7)...On October 29th I went to the white-marble and crimson hall of theMarinsky palace, where the Council of the Republic sat, to hearTerestchenko's declaration of the Government's foreign policy,awaited with such terrible anxiety by all the peace-thirsty andexhausted land.A tall, impeccably-dressed young man with a smooth face and highcheek-bones, suavely reading his careful, non-committal speech. (SeeApp. II, Sect. 8) Nothing.... Only the same platitudes about crushingGerman militarism with the help of the Allies-about the "stateinterests" of Russia, about the "embarrassment" caused bySkobeliev's _nakaz._ He ended with the key-note:"Russia is a great power. Russia will remain a great power, whateverhappens. We must all defend her, we must show that we are defendersof a great ideal, and children of a great power."Nobody was satisfied. The reactionaries wanted a "strong"imperialist policy; the democratic parties wanted an assurance thatthe Government would press for peace.... I reproduce an editorial in_Rabotchi i Soldat_ (Worker and Soldier), organ of the BolshevikPetrograd Soviet:THE GOVERNMENT'S ANSWER TO THE TRENCHESThe most taciturn of our Ministers, Mr. Terestchenko, has actuallytold the trenches the following:1. We are closely united with our Allies. (Not with the peoples, butwith the Governments.)2. There is no use for the democracy to discuss the possibility orimpossibility of a winter campaign. That will be decided by theGovernments of our Allies.3. The 1st of July offensive was beneficial and a very happy affair.(He did not mention the consequences.)4. It is not true that our Allies do not care about us. The Ministerhas in his possession very important declarations. (Declarations?What about deeds? What about the behaviour of the British fleet?(See App. II, Sect. 9) The parleying of the British king with exiledcounter-revolutionary General Gurko? The Minister did not mentionall this.)5. The _nakaz_ to Skobeliev is bad; the Allies don't like it and theRussian diplomats don't like it. In the Allied Conference we mustall 'speak one language.'And is that all? That is all. What is the way out? The solution is,faith in the Allies and in Terestchenko. When will peace come? Whenthe Allies permit.That is how the Government replied to the trenches about peace!Now in the background of Russian politics began to form the vagueoutlines of a sinister power-the Cossacks. _Novaya Zhizn_ (NewLife), Gorky's paper, called attention to their activities:At the beginning of the Revolution the Cossacks refused to shootdown the people. When Kornilov marched on Petrograd they refused tofollow him. From passive loyalty to the Revolution the Cossacks havepassed to an active political offensive (against it). From theback-ground of the Revolution they have suddenly advanced to thefront of the stage....Kaledin, _ataman_ of the Don Cossacks, had been dismissed by theProvisional Government for his complicity in the Kornilov affair. Heflatly refused to resign, and surrounded by three immense Cossackarmies lay at Novotcherkask, plotting and menacing. So great was hispower that the Government was forced to ignore his insubordination.More than that, it was compelled formally to recognise the Councilof the Union of Cossack Armies, and to declare illegal thenewly-formed Cossack Section of the Soviets....In the first part of October a Cossack delegation called uponKerensky, arrogantly insisting that the charges against Kaledin bedropped, and reproaching the Minister-President for yielding to theSoviets. Kerensky agreed to let Kaledin alone, and then is reportedto have said, "In the eyes of the Soviet leaders I am a despot and atyrant.... As for the Provisional Government, not only does it notdepend upon the Soviets, but it considers it regrettable that theyexist at all."At the same time another Cossack mission called upon the Britishambassador, treating with him boldly as representatives of "the freeCossack people."In the Don something very like a Cossack Republic had beenestablished. The Kuban declared itself an independent Cossack State.The Soviets of Rostov-on-Don and Yekaterinburg were dispersed byarmed Cossacks, and the headquarters of the Coal Miners' Union atKharkov raided. In all its manifestations the Cossack movement wasanti-Socialist and militaristic. Its leaders were nobles and greatland-owners, like Kaledin, Kornilov, Generals Dutov, Karaulov andBardizhe, and it was backed by the powerful merchants and bankers ofMoscow....Old Russia was rapidly breaking up. In Ukraine, in Finland, Poland,White Russia, the nationalist movements gathered strength and becamebolder. The local Governments, controlled by the propertied classes,claimed autonomy, refusing to obey orders from Petrograd. AtHelsingfors the Finnish Senate declined to loan money to theProvisional Government, declared Finland autonomous, and demandedthe withdrawal of Russian troops. The bourgeois Rada at Kievextended the boundaries of Ukraine until they included all therichest agricultural lands of South Russia, as far east as theUrals, and began the formation of a national army. PremierVinnitchenko hinted at a separate peace with Germany-and theProvisional Government was helpless. Siberia, the Caucasus, demandedseparate Constituent Assemblies. And in all these countries therewas the beginning of a bitter struggle between the authorities andthe local Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies....Conditions were daily more chaotic. Hundreds of thousands ofsoldiers were deserting the front and beginning to move in vast,aimless tides over the face of the land. The peasants of Tambov andTver Governments, tired of waiting for the land, exasperated by therepressive measures of the Government, were burning manor-houses andmassacring land-owners. Immense strikes and lock-outs convulsedMoscow, Odessa and the coal-mines of the Don. Transportation wasparalysed; the army was starving and in the big cities there was nobread.The Government, torn between the democratic and reactionaryfactions, could do nothing: when forced to act it always supportedthe interests of the propertied classes. Cossacks were sent torestore order among the peasants, to break the strikes. In Tashkent,Government authorities suppressed the Soviet. In Petrograd theEconomic Council, established to rebuild the shattered economic lifeof the country, came to a deadlock between the opposing forces ofcapital and labour, and was dissolved by Kerensky. The old régimemilitary men, backed by Cadets, demanded that harsh measures beadopted to restore discipline in the Army and the Navy. In vainAdmiral Verderevsky, the venerable Minister of Marine, and GeneralVerkhovsky, Minister of War, insisted that only a new, voluntary,democratic discipline, based on cooperation with the soldiers' andsailors' Committees, could save the army and navy. Theirrecommendations were ignored.The reactionaries seemed determined to provoke popular anger. Thetrial of Kornilov was coming on. More and more openly the bourgeoispress defended him, speaking of him as "the great Russian patriot."Burtzev's paper, _Obshtchee Dielo_ (Common Cause), called for adictatorship of Kornilov, Kaledin and Kerensky!I had a talk with Burtzev one day in the press gallery of theCouncil of the Republic. A small, stooped figure with a wrinkledface, eyes near-sighted behind thick glasses, untidy hair and beardstreaked with grey."Mark my words, young man! What Russia needs is a Strong Man. Weshould get our minds off the Revolution now and concentrate on theGermans. Bunglers, bunglers, to defeat Kornilov; and back of thebunglers are the German agents. Kornilov should have won...."On the extreme right the organs of the scarcely-veiled Monarchists,Purishkevitch's _Narodny Tribun_ (People's Tribune), _Novaya Rus_(New Russia), and _Zhivoye Slovo_ (Living Word), openly advocatedthe extermination of the revolutionary democracy....On the 23rd of October occurred the naval battle with a Germansquadron in the Gulf of Riga. On the pretext that Petrograd was indanger, the Provisional Government drew up plans for evacuating thecapital. First the great munitions works were to go, distributedwidely throughout Russia; and then the Government itself was to moveto Moscow. Instantly the Bolsheviki began to cry out that theGovernment was abandoning the Red Capital in order to weaken theRevolution. Riga had been sold to the Germans; now Petrograd wasbeing betrayed!The bourgeois press was joyful. "At Moscow," said the Cadet paper_Ryetch_ (Speech), "the Government can pursue its work in a tranquilatmosphere, without being interfered with by anarchists." Rodzianko,leader of the right wing of the Cadet party, declared in _UtroRossii_ (The Morning of Russia) that the taking of Petrograd by theGermans would be a blessing, because it would destroy the Sovietsand get rid of the revolutionary Baltic Fleet:Petrograd is in danger (he wrote). I say to myself, "Let God takecare of Petrograd." They fear that if Petrograd is lost the centralrevolutionary organisations will be destroyed. To that I answer thatI rejoice if all these organisations are destroyed; for they willbring nothing but disaster upon Russia....With the taking of Petrograd the Baltic Fleet will also bedestroyed.... But there will be nothing to regret; most of thebattleships are completely demoralised....In the face of a storm of popular disapproval the plan of evacuationwas repudiated.Meanwhile the Congress of Soviets loomed over Russia like athunder-cloud, shot through with lightnings. It was opposed, notonly by the Government but by all the "moderate" Socialists. TheCentral Army and Fleet Committees, the Central Committees of some ofthe Trade Unions, the Peasants' Soviets, but most of all the_Tsay-ee-kah_ itself, spared no pains to prevent the meeting._Izviestia_ and _Golos Soldata_ (Voice of the Soldier), newspapersfounded by the Petrograd Soviet but now in the hands of the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ fiercely assailed it, as did the entire artillery ofthe Socialist Revolutionary party press, _Dielo Naroda_ (People'sCause) and _Volia Naroda_ (People's Will).Delegates were sent through the country, messages flashed by wire tocommittees in charge of local Soviets, to Army Committees,instructing them to halt or delay elections to the Congress. Solemnpublic resolutions against the Congress, declarations that thedemocracy was opposed to the meeting so near the date of theConstituent Assembly, representatives from the Front, from the Unionof Zemstvos, the Peasants' Union, Union of Cossack Armies, Union ofOfficers, Knights of St. George, Death Battalions, [*] protesting....[*See Notes and Explanations.]The Council of the Russian Republic was one chorus of disapproval.The entire machinery set up by the Russian Revolution of Marchfunctioned to block the Congress of Soviets....On the other hand was the shapeless will of the proletariat-theworkmen, common soldiers and poor peasants. Many local Soviets werealready Bolshevik; then there were the organisations of theindustrial workers, the _Fabritchno-Zavodskiye Comitieti-_Factory-Shop Committees; and the insurgent Army and Fleetorganisations. In some places the people, prevented from electingtheir regular Soviet delegates, held rump meetings and chose one oftheir number to go to Petrograd. In others they smashed the oldobstructionist committees and formed new ones. A ground-swell ofrevolt heaved and cracked the crust which had been slowly hardeningon the surface of revolutionary fires dormant all those months. Onlyan spontaneous mass-movement could bring about the All-RussianCongress of Soviets....Day after day the Bolshevik orators toured the barracks andfactories, violently denouncing "this Government of civil war." OneSunday we went, on a top-heavy steam tram that lumbered throughoceans of mud, between stark factories and immense churches, to_Obukhovsky Zavod,_ a Government munitions-plant out on theSchlüsselburg Prospekt.The meeting took place between the gaunt brick walls of a hugeunfinished building, ten thousand black-clothed men and women packedaround a scaffolding draped in red, people heaped on piles of lumberand bricks, perched high upon shadowy girders, intent andthunder-voiced. Through the dull, heavy sky now and again burst thesun, flooding reddish light through the skeleton windows upon themass of simple faces upturned to us.Lunatcharsky, a slight, student-like figure with the sensitive faceof an artist, was telling why the power must be taken by theSoviets. Nothing else could guarantee the Revolution against itsenemies, who were deliberately ruining the country, ruining thearmy, creating opportunities for a new Konilov.A soldier from the Rumanian front, thin, tragical and fierce, cried,"Comrades! We are starving at the front, we are stiff with cold. Weare dying for no reason. I ask the American comrades to carry wordto America, that the Russians will never give up their Revolutionuntil they die. We will hold the fort with all our strength untilthe peoples of the world rise and help us! Tell the American workersto rise and fight for the Social Revolution!"Then came Petrovsky, slight, slow-voiced, implacable: "Now is thetime for deeds, not words. The economic situation is bad, but wemust get used to it. They are trying to starve us and freeze us.They are trying to provoke us. But let them know that they can gotoo far-that if they dare to lay their hands upon the organisationsof the proletariat we will sweep them away like scum from the faceof the earth!"The Bolshevik press suddenly expanded. Besides the two party papers,_Rabotchi Put_ and _Soldat_ (Soldier), there appeared a new paperfor the peasants, _Derevenskaya Byednota_ (Village Poorest), pouredout in a daily half-million edition; and on October 17th, _Rabotchii Soldat._ Its leading article summed up the Bolshevik point of view:The fourth year's campaign will mean the annihilation of the armyand the country.... There is danger for the safety of Petrograd....Counter-revolutionists rejoice in the people's misfortunes.... Thepeasants brought to desperation come out in open rebellion; thelandlords and Government authorities massacre them with punitiveexpeditions; factories and mines are closing down, workmen arethreatened with starvation.... The bourgeoisie and its Generals wantto restore a blind discipline in the army.... Supported by thebourgeoisie, the Kornilovtsi are openly getting ready to break upthe meeting of the Constituent Assembly....The Kerensky Government is against the people. He will destroy thecountry.... This paper stands for the people and by the people-thepoor classes, workers, soldiers and peasants. The people can only besaved by the completion of the Revolution... and for this purpose thefull power must be in the hands of the Soviets....This paper advocates the following: All power to the Soviets-both inthe capital and in the provinces.Immediate truce on all fronts. An honest peace between peoples.Landlord estates-without compensation-to the peasants.Workers' control over industrial production.A faithfully and honestly elected Constituent Assembly.It is interesting to reproduce here a passage from that samepaper-the organ of those Bolsheviki so well known to the world asGerman agents:The German kaiser, covered with the blood of millions of deadpeople, wants to push his army against Petrograd. Let us call to theGerman workmen, soldiers and peasants, who want peace not less thanwe do, to... stand up against this damned war!This can be done only by a revolutionary Government, which wouldspeak really for the workmen, soldiers and peasants of Russia, andwould appeal over the heads of the diplomats directly to the Germantroops, fill the German trenches with proclamations in the Germanlanguage.... Our airmen would spread these proclamations all overGermany....In the Council of the Republic the gulf between the two sides of thechamber deepened day by day."The propertied classes," cried Karelin, for the Left SocialistRevolutionaries, "want to exploit the revolutionary machine of theState to bind Russia to the war-chariot of the Allies! Therevolutionary parties are absolutely against this policy...."Old Nicholas Tchaikovsky, representing the Populist Socialists,spoke against giving the land to the peasants, and took the side ofthe Cadets: "We must have immediately strong discipline in thearmy.... Since the beginning of the war I have not ceased to insistthat it is a crime to undertake social and economic reforms inwar-time. We are committing that crime, and yet I am not the enemyof these reforms, because I am a Socialist."Cries from the Left, "We don't believe you!" Mighty applause fromthe Right....Adzhemov, for the Cadets, declared that there was no necessity totell the army what it was fighting for, since every soldier ought torealise that the first task was to drive the enemy from Russianterritory.Kerensky himself came twice, to plead passionately for nationalunity, once bursting into tears at the end. The assembly heard himcoldly, interrupting with ironical remarks.Smolny Institute, headquarters of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and of thePetrograd Soviet, lay miles out on the edge of the city, beside thewide Neva. I went there on a street-car, moving snail-like with agroaning noise through the cobbled, muddy streets, and jammed withpeople. At the end of the line rose the graceful smoke-blue cupolasof Smolny Convent outlined in dull gold, beautiful; and beside itthe great barracks like façade of Smolny Institute, two hundredyards long and three lofty stories high, the Imperial arms carvedhugely in stone still insolent over the entrance....Under the old régime a famous convent-school for the daughters ofthe Russian nobility, patronised by the Tsarina herself, theInstitute had been taken over by the revolutionary organisations ofworkers and soldiers. Within were more than a hundred huge rooms,white and bare, on their doors enamelled plaques still informing thepasserby that within was "Ladies' Class-room Number 4" or "Teachers'Bureau"; but over these hung crudely-lettered signs, evidence of thevitality of the new order: "Central Committee of the PetrogradSoviet" and _"Tsay-ee-kah"_ and "Bureau of Foreign Affairs"; "Unionof Socialist Soldiers," "Central Committee of the All-Russian TradeUnions," "Factory-Shop Committees," "Central Army Committee"; andthe central offices and caucus-rooms of the political parties....The long, vaulted corridors, lit by rare electric lights, werethronged with hurrying shapes of soldiers and workmen, some bentunder the weight of huge bundles of newspapers, proclamations,printed propaganda of all sorts. The sound of their heavy boots madea deep and incessant thunder on the wooden floor.... Signs were postedup everywhere: "Comrades! For the sake of your health, preservecleanliness!" Long tables stood at the head of the stairs on everyfloor, and on the landings, heaped with pamphlets and the literatureof the different political parties, for sale....The spacious, low-ceilinged refectory downstairs was still adining-room. For two rubles I bought a ticket entitling me todinner, and stood in line with a thousand others, waiting to get tothe long serving-tables, where twenty men and women were ladlingfrom immense cauldrons cabbage soup, hunks of meat and piles of_kasha,_ slabs of black bread. Five kopeks paid for tea in a tincup. From a basket one grabbed a greasy wooden spoon.... The benchesalong the wooden tables were packed with hungry proletarians,wolfing their food, plotting, shouting rough jokes across the room....[Graphic page-33 -- text of placard in russian, translation follows]COMRADESFOR THE SAKE OF YOUR HEALTH,PRESERVE CLEANLINESS.Upstairs was another eating-place, reserved for the _Tsay-ee-kah-_though every one went there. Here could be had bread thicklybuttered and endless glasses of tea....In the south wing on the second floor was the great hall ofmeetings, the former ball-room of the Institute. A lofty white roomlighted by glazed-white chandeliers holding hundreds of ornateelectric bulbs, and divided by two rows of massive columns; at oneend a dais, flanked with two tall many-branched light standards, anda gold frame behind, from which the Imperial portrait had been cut.Here on festal occasions had been banked brilliant military andecclesiastical uniforms, a setting for Grand Duchesses....Just across the hall outside was the office of the CredentialsCommittee for the Congress of Soviets. I stood there watching thenew delegates come in-burly, bearded soldiers, workmen in blackblouses, a few long-haired peasants. The girl in charge-a member ofPlekhanov's _Yedinstvo_ [*] group-smiled contemptuously. "These are[* See Notes and Explanations]very different people from the delegates to the first _Siezd_(Congress)," she remarked. "See how rough and ignorant they look!The Dark People...." It was true; the depths of Russia had beenstirred, and it was the bottom which came uppermost now. TheCredentials Committee, appointed by the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ waschallenging delegate after delegate, on the ground that they hadbeen illegally elected. Karakhan, member of the Bolshevik CentralCommittee, simply grinned. "Never mind," he said, "When the timecomes we'll see that you get your seats...."_Rabotchi i Soldat_ said:The attention of delegates to the new All-Russian Congress is calledto attempts of certain members of the Organising Committee to breakup the Congress, by asserting that it will not take place, and thatdelegates had better leave Petrograd.... Pay no attention to theselies.... Great days are coming....It was evident that a quorum would not come together by November 2,so the opening of the Congress was postponed to the 7th. But thewhole country was now aroused; and the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries, realising that they were defeated, suddenly changedtheir tactics and began to wire frantically to their provincialorganisations to elect as many "moderate" Socialist delegates aspossible. At the same time the Executive Committee of the Peasants'Soviets issued an emergency call for a Peasants' Congress, to meetDecember 13th and offset whatever action the workers and soldiersmight take...What would the Bolsheviki do? Rumours ran through the city thatthere would be an armed "demonstration," a _vystuplennie_-"comingout" of the workers and soldiers. The bourgeois and reactionarypress prophesied insurrection, and urged the Government to arrestthe Petrograd Soviet, or at least to prevent the meeting of theCongress. Such sheets as _Novaya Rus_ advocated a general Bolshevikmassacre.Gorky's paper, _Novaya Zhizn,_ agreed with the Bolsheviki that thereactionaries were attempting to destroy the Revolution, and that ifnecessary they must be resisted by force of arms; but all theparties of the revolutionary democracy must present a united front.As long as the democracy has not organised its principal forces, solong as the resistance to its influence is still strong, there is noadvantage in passing to the attack. But if the hostile elementsappeal to force, then the revolutionary democracy should enter thebattle to seize the power, and it will be sustained by the mostprofound strata of the people....Gorky pointed out that both reactionary and Government newspaperswere inciting the Bolsheviki to violence. An insurrection, however,would prepare the way for a new Kornilov. He urged the Bolsheviki todeny the rumours. Potressov, in the Menshevik _Dien_ (Day),published a sensational story, accompanied by a map, which professedto reveal the secret Bolshevik plan of campaign.As if by magic, the walls were covered with warnings, (See App. II,Sect. 10) proclamations, appeals, from the Central Committees of the"moderate" and conservative factions and the _Tsay-ee-kah,_denouncing any "demonstrations," imploring the workers and soldiersnot to listen to agitators. For instance, this from the MilitarySection of the Socialist Revolutionary party:Again rumours are spreading around the town of an intended_vystuplennie._ What is the source of these rumours? Whatorganisation authorises these agitators who preach insurrection? TheBolsheviki, to a question addressed to them in the _Tsay-ee-kah,_denied that they have anything to do with it.... But these rumoursthemselves carry with them a great danger. It may easily happenthat, not taking into consideration the state of mind of themajority of the workers, soldiers and peasants, individual hot-headswill call out part of the workers and soldiers on the streets,inciting them to an uprising.... In this fearful time through whichrevolutionary Russia is passing, any insurrection can easily turninto civil war, and there can result from it the destruction of allorganisations of the proletariat, built up with so much labour.... Thecounter-revolutionary plotters are planning to take advantage ofthis insurrection to destroy the Revolution, open the front toWilhelm, and wreck the Constituent Assembly.... Stick stubbornly toyour posts! Do not come out!On October 28th, in the corridors of Smolny, I spoke with Kameniev,a little man with a reddish pointed beard and Gallic gestures. Hewas not at all sure that enough delegates would come. "If there _is_a Congress," he said, "it will represent the overwhelming sentimentof the people. If the majority is Bolshevik, as I think it will be,we shall demand that the power be given to the Soviets, and theProvisional Government must resign...."Volodarsky, a tall, pale youth with glasses and a bad complexion,was more definite. "The 'Lieber-Dans' and the other compromisers aresabotaging the Congress. If they succeed in preventing itsmeeting,-well, then we are realists enough not to depend on _that!"_Under date of October 29th I find entered in my notebook thefollowing items culled from the newspapers of the day:Moghilev (General Staff Headquarters). Concentration here of loyalGuard Regiments, the Savage Division, Cossacks and Death Battalions.The _yunkers_ of the Officers' Schools of Pavlovsk, Tsarskoye Seloand Peterhof ordered by the Government to be ready to come toPetrograd. Oranienbaum _yunkers_ arrive in the city.Part of the Armoured Car Division of the Petrograd garrism stationedin the Winter Palace.Upon orders signed by Trotzky, several thousand rifles delivered bythe Government Arms Factory at Sestroretzk to delegates of thePetrograd workmen.At a meeting of the City Militia of the Lower Liteiny Quarter, aresolution demanding that all power be given to the Soviets.This is just a sample of the confused events of those feverish days,when everybody knew that something was going to happen, but nobodyknew just what.At a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet in Smolny, the night of October30th, Trotzky branded the assertions of the bourgeois press that theSoviet contemplated armed insurention as "an attempt of thereactionaries to discredit and wreck the Congress of Soviets.... ThePetrograd Soviet," he declared, "had not ordered any _uystuplennie._If it is necessary we shall do so, and we will be supported by thePetrogruad garrison.... They (the Government) are preparing acounter-revolution; and we shall answer with an offensive which willbe merciless and decisive."It is true that the Petrograd Soviet had not ordered ademonstration, but the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party wasconsidering the question of insurrection. All night long the 23dthey met. There were present all the party intellectuals, theleaders-and delegates of the Petrograd workers and garrison. Aloneof the intellectuals Lenin and Trotzky stood for insurrection. Even   urrection. Even   |          |the military men opposed it. A vote was taken. Insurrection wasdefeated!Then arose a rough workman, his face convulsed with rage. "I speakfor the Petrograd proletariat," he said, harshly. "We are in favourof insurrection. Have it your own way, but I tell you now that ifyou allow the Soviets to be destroyed, _we're through with you!"_Some soldiers joined him.... And after that they votedagain-insurrection won....However, the right wing of the Bolsheviki, led by Riazanov, Kamenievand Zinoviev, continued to campaign against an armed rising. On themorning of October 31st appeared in _Rabotchi Put_ the firstinstalment of Lenin's "Letter to the Comrades," (See App. II, Sect.11) one of the most audacious pieces of political propaganda theworld has ever seen. In it Lenin seriously presented the argumentsin favour of insurrection, taking as text the objections of Kamenievand Riazonov."Either we must abandon our slogan, 'All Power to the Soviets,' " hewrote, "or else we must make an insurrection. There is no middlecourse...."That same afternoon Paul Miliukov, leader of the Cadets, made abrilliant, bitter speech (See App. II, Sect. 12) in the Council ofthe Republic, branding the Skobeliev _nakaz_ as pro-German,declaring that the "revolutionary democracy" was destroying Russia,sneering at Terestchenko, and openly declaring that he preferredGerman diplomacy to Russian.... The Left benches were one roaringtumult all through....On its part the Government could not ignore the significance of thesuccess of the Bolshevik propaganda. On the 29th joint commission ofthe Government and the Council of the Republic hastily drew up twolaws, one for giving the land temporarily to the peasants, and theother for pushing an energetic foreign policy of peace. The next dayKerensky suspended capital punishment in the army. That sameafternoon was opened with great ceremony the first session of thenew "Commission for Strengthening the Republican Régime and FightingAgainst Anarchy and Counter-Revolution"-of which history shows notthe slightest further trace.... The following morning with two othercorrespondents I interviewed Kerensky (See App. II, Sect. 13)-thelast time he received journalists."The Russian people," he said, bitterly, "are suffering fromeconomic fatigue-and from disillusionment with the Allies! The worldthinks that the Russian Revolution is at an end. Do not be mistaken.The Russian Revolution is just beginning...." Words more prophetic,perhaps, than he knew.Stormy was the all-night meeting of the Petrograd Soviet the 30th ofOctober, at which I was present. The "moderate" Socialistintellectuals, officers, members of Army Committees, the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ were there in force. Against them rose up workmen,peasants and common soldiers, passionate and simple.A peasant told of the disorders in Tver, which he said were causedby the arrest of the Land Committees. "This Kerensky is nothing buta shield to the _pomieshtchiki_ (landowners)," he cried. "They knowthat at the Constituent Assembly we will take the land anyway, sothey are trying to destroy the Constituent Assembly!"A machinist from the Putilov works described how the superintendentswere closing down the departments one by one on the pretext thatthere was no fuel or raw materials. The Factory-Shop Committee, hedeclared, had discovered huge hidden supplies."It is a _provocatzia,"_ said he. "They want to starve us-or driveus to violence!"Among the soldiers one began, "Comrades! I bring you greetings fromthe place where men are digging their graves and call them trenches!"Then arose a tall, gaunt young soldier, with flashing eyes, met witha roar of welcome. It was Tchudnovsky, reported killed in the Julyfighting, and now risen from the dead."The soldier masses no longer trust their officers. Even the ArmyCommittees, who refused to call a meeting of our Soviet, betrayedus.... The masses of the soldiers want the Constituent Assembly to beheld exactly when it was called for, and those who dare to postponeit will be cursed-and not only platonic curses either, for the Armyhas guns too...."He told of the electoral campaign for the Constituent now raging inthe Fifth Army. "The officers, and especially the Mensheviki and theSocialist Revolutionaries, are trying deliberately to cripple theBolsheviki. Our papers are not allowed to circulate in the trenches.Our speakers are arrested-""Why don't you speak about the lack of bread?" shouted anothersoldier."Man shall not live by bread alone," answered Tchudnovsky, sternly....Followed him an officer, delegate from the Vitebsk Soviet, aMenshevik _oboronetz._ "It isn't the question of who has the power.The trouble is not with the Government, but with the war.... and thewar must be won before any change-" At this, hoots and ironicalcheers. "These Bolshevik agitators are demagogues!" The hall rockedwith laughter. "Let us for a moment forget the class struggle-" Buthe got no farther. A voice yelled, "Don't you wish we would!"Petrograd presented a curious spectacle in those days. In thefactories the committe-rooms were filled with stacks of rifles,couriers came and went, the Red Guard [*] drilled.... In all the[* See Notes and Explanations]barracks meetings every night, and all day long interminable hotarguments. On the streets the crowds thickened toward gloomyevening, pouring in slow voluble tides up and down the Nevsky,fighting for the newspapers.... Hold-ups increased to such an extentthat it was dangerous to walk down side streets.... On the Sadovayaone afternoon I saw a crowd of several hundred people beat andtrample to death a soldier caught stealing.... Mysterious individualscirculated around the shivering women who waited in _queue_ longcold hours for bread and milk, whispering that the Jews had corneredthe food supply-and that while the people starved, the Sovietmembers lived luxuriously....At Smolny there were strict guards at the door and the outer gates,demanding everybody's pass. The committee-rooms buzzed and hummedall day and all night, hundreds of soldiers and workmen slept on thefloor, wherever they could find room. Upstairs in the great hall athousand people crowded to the uproarious sessions of the PetrogradSoviet....Gambling clubs functioned hectically from dusk to dawn, withchampagne flowing and stakes of twenty thousand rubles. In thecentre of the city at night prostitutes in jewels and expensive furswalked up and down, crowded the cafés....Monarchist plots, German spies, smugglers hatching schemes....And in the rain, the bitter chill, the great throbbing city undergrey skies rushing faster and faster toward-what?                              Chapter III                              On the EveIN the relations of a weak Government and a rebellious people therecomes a time when every act of the authorities exasperates themasses, and every refusal to act excites their contempt....The proposal to abandon Petrograd raised a hurricane; Kerensky'spublic denial that the Government had any such intention was met withhoots of derision.Pinned to the wall by the pressure of the Revolution (cried _RabotchiPut),_ the Government of "provisional" bourgeois tries to get free bygiving out lying assurances that it never thought of fleeing fromPetrograd, and that it didn't wish to surrender the capital....In Kharkov thirty thousand coal miners organised, adopting thepreamble of the I. W. W. constitution: "The working class and theemploying class have nothing in common." Dispersed by Cossacks, somewere locked out by the mine-owners, and the rest declared a generalstrike. Minister of Commerce and Industry Konovalov appointed hisassistant, Orlov, with plenary powers, to settle the trouble. Orlovwas hated by the miners. But the _Tsay-ee-kah_ not only supported hisappointment, but refused to demand that the Cossacks be recalled fromthe Don Basin....This was followed by the dispersal of the Soviet at Kaluga. TheBolsheviki, having secured a majority in the Soviet, set free somepolitical prisoners. With the sanction of the Government Commissarthe Municipal Duma called in troops from Minsk, and bombarded theSoviet headquarters with artillery. The Bolsheviki yielded, but asthey left the building Cossacks attacked them, crying, "This is whatwe'll do to all the other Bolshevik Soviets, including those ofMoscow and Petrograd!" This incident sent a wave of panic ragethroughout Russia....In Petrograd was ending a regional Congress of Soviets of the North,presided over by the Bolshevik Krylenko. By an immense majority itresolved that all power should be assumed by the All-RussianCongress; and concluded by greeting the Bolsheviki in prison, biddingthem rejoice, for the hour of their liberation was at hand. At thesame time the first All-Russian Conference of Factory-Shop Committees(See App. III, Sect. 1) declared emphatically for the Soviets, andcontinued significantly,After liberating themselves politically from Tsardom, theworking-class wants to see the democratic régime triumphant in thesphere of its productive activity. This is best expressed by Workers'Control over industrial production, which naturally arose in theatmosphere of economic decomposition created by the criminal policyof the dominating classes....The Union of Railwaymen was demanding the resignation of Liverovsky,Minister of Ways and Communications....In the name of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ Skobeliev insisted that the _nakaz_be presented at the Allied Conference, and formally protested againstthe sending of Terestchenko to Paris. Terestchenko offered to resign....General Verkhovsky, unable to accomplish his reorganisation of thearmy, only came to Cabinet meetings at long intervals....On November 3d Burtzev's _Obshtchee Dielo_ came out with greatheadlines:Citizens! Save the fatherland!I have just learned that yesterday, at a meeting of the Commissionfor National Defence, Minister of War General Verkhovsky, one of theprincipal persons responsible for the fall of Kornilov, proposed tosign a separate peace, independently of the Allies.That is treason to Russia!Terestchenko declared that the Provisional Government had not evenexamined Verkhovsky's proposition."You might think," said Terestchenko, "that we were in a madhouse!"The members of the Commission were astounded at the General's words.General Alexeyev wept.No! It is not madness! It is worse. It is direct treason to Russia!Kerensky, Terestchenko and Nekrassov must immediately answer usconcerning the words of Verkhovsky.Citizens, arise!Russia is being sold!Save her!What Verkhovsky really said was that the Allies must be pressed tooffer peace, because the Russian army could fight no longer....Both in Russia and abroad the sensation was tremendous. Verkhovskywas given "indefinite leave of absence for illhealth," and left theGovernment. _Obshtchee Dielo_ was suppressed....Sunday, November 4th, was designated as the Day of the PetrogradSoviet, with immense meetings planned all over the city, ostensiblyto raise money for the organisation and the press; really, to make ademonstration of strength. Suddenly it was announced that on the sameday the Cossacks would hold a _Krestny Khod_-Procession of theCross-in honour of the Ikon of 1612, through whose miraculousintervention Napoleon had been driven from Moscow. The atmosphere waselectric; a spark might kindle civil war. The Petrograd Soviet issueda manifesto, headed "Brothers-Cossacks!"You, Cossacks, are being incited against us, workers and soldiers.This plan of Cain is being put into operation by our common enemies,the oppressors, the privileged classes-generals, bankers, landlords,former officials, former servants of the Tsar.... We are hated by allgrafters, rich men, princes, nobles, generals, including your Cossackgenerals. They are ready at any moment to destroy the PetrogradSoviet and crush the Revolution....On the 4th of November somebody is organising a Cossack religiousprocession. It is a question of the free consciousness of everyindividual whether he will or will not take part in this procession.We do not interfere in this matter, nor do we obstruct anybody....However, we warn you, Cossacks! Look out and see to it that under thepretext of a _Krestni Khod,_ your Kaledins do not instigate youagainst workmen, against soldiers....The procession was hastily called off....In the barracks and the working-class quarters of the town theBolsheviki were preaching, "All Power to the Soviets!" and agents ofthe Dark Forces were urging the people to rise and slaughter theJews, shop-keepers, Socialist leaders....On one side the Monarchist press, inciting to bloody repression-onthe other Lenin's great voice roaring, "Insurrection!.... We cannotwait any longer!"Even the bourgeois press was uneasy. (See App. III, Sect. 2)_Birjevya Viedomosti_ (Exchange Gazette) called the Bolshevikpropaganda an attack on "the most elementary principles ofsociety-personal security and the respect for private property."[Graphic page-46 Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet]Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet to the Cosacks to call off their_Krestny Khod_-the religious procession planned for November 4th (ourcalendar). "Brothers-Cossacks!" it begins. "The Petrograd Soviet ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies addresses you."But it was the "moderate" Socialist journals which were the mosthostile. (See App. III, Sect. 3) "The Bolsheviki are the mostdangerous enemies of the Revolution," declared _Dielo Naroda._ Saidthe Menshevik _Dien,_ "The Government ought to defend itself anddefend us." Plekhanov's paper, _Yedinstvo_ (Unity) (See App. III,Sect. 4), called the attention of the Government to the fact that thePetrograd workers were being armed, and demanded stern measuresagainst the Bolsheviki.Daily the Government seemed to become more helpless. Even theMunicipal administration broke down. The columns of the morningpapers were filled with accounts of the most audacious robberies andmurders, and the criminals were unmolested.On the other hand armed workers patrolled the streets at night, doingbattle with marauders and requisitioning arms wherever they foundthem.On the first of November Colonel Polkovnikov, Military Commander ofPetrograd, issued a proclamation:Despite the difficult days through which the country is passing,irresponsible appeals to armed demonstrations and massacres are stillbeing spread around Petrograd, and from day to day robbery anddisorder increase.This state of things is disorganising the life of the citizens, andhinders the systematic work of the Government and the MunicipalInstitutions.In full consciousness of my responsibility and my duty before mycountry, I command:1. Every military unit, in accordance with special instructions andwithin the territory of its garrison, to afford every assistance tothe Municipality, to the Commissars, and to the militia, in theguarding of Government institutions.2. The organisation of patrols, in co-operation with the DistrictCommander and the representatives of the city militia, and the takingof measures for the arrest of criminals and deserters.3. The arrest of all persons entering barracks and inciting to armeddemonstrations and massacres, and their delivery to the headquartersof the Second Commander of the city.4. To suppress any armed demonstration or riot at its start, with allarmed forces at hand.5. To afford assistance to the Commissars in preventing unwarrantedsearches in houses and unwarranted arrests.6. To report immediately all that happens in the district undercharge to the Staff of the Petrograd Military District.I call upon all Army Committees and organisations to afford theirhelp to the commanders in fulfilment of the duties with which theyare charged.In the Council of the Republic Kerensky declared that the Governmentwas fully aware of the Bolshevik preparations, and had sufficientforce to cope with any demonstration. (See App. III, Sect. 5) Heaccused _Novaya Rus_ and _Robotchi Put_ of both doing the same kindof subversive work. "But owing to the absolute freedom of the press,"he added, "the Government is not in a position to combat printedlies. [*]...." Declaring that these were two aspects of the same[* This was not quite candid.  The Provisional Gevernment hadsuppressed Bolshevik papers before, in July, and was planning todo so again.]propaganda, which had for its object the counter-revolution, soardently desired by the Dark Forces, he went on:"I am a doomed man, it doesn't matter what happens to me, and I havethe audacity to say that the other enigmatic part is that of theunbelievable provocation created in the city by the Bolsheviki!"On November 2d only fifteen delegates to the Congress of Soviets hadarrived. Next day there were a hundred, and the morning after that ahundred and seventy-five, of whom one hundred and three wereBolsheviki.... Four hundred constituted a quorum, and the Congress wasonly three days off....I spent a great deal of time at Smolny. It was no longer easy to getin. Double rows of sentries guarded the outer gates, and once insidethe front door there was a long line of people waiting to be let in,four at a time, to be questioned as to their identity and theirbusiness. Passes were given out, and the pass system was changedevery few hours; for spies continually sneaked through....[Graphic page-49  Russian Pass to Reed, translation follows]Pass to Smolny Institute, issued by the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, giving me the right of entry at any time.

Commandant                               AdjutantOne day as I came up to the outer gate I saw Trotzky and his wifejust ahead of me. They were halted by a soldier. Trotzky searchedthrough his pockets, but could find no pass."Never mind," he said finally. "You know me. My name is Trotzky.""You haven't got a pass," answered the soldier stubbornly."You cannot go in. Names don't mean anything to me.""But I am the president of the Petrograd Soviet.""Well," replied the soldier, "if you're as important a fellow as thatyou must at least have one little paper."Trotzky was very patient. "Let me see the Commandant," he said. Thesoldier hesitated, grumbling something about not wanting to disturbthe Commandant for every devil that came along. He beckoned finallyto the soldier in command of the guard. Trotzky explained matters tohim. "My name is Trotzky," he repeated."Trotzky?" The other soldier scratched his head. "I've heard the namesomewhere," he said at length. "I guess it's all right. You can go onin, comrade...."In the corridor I met Karakhan, member of the Bolshevik CentralCommittee, who explained to me what the new Government would be like."A loose organisation, sensitive to the popular will as expressedthrough the Soviets, allowing local forces full play. At present theProvisional Government obstructs the action of the local democraticwill, just as the Tsar's Government did. The initiative of the newsociety shall come from below.... The form of the Government will bemodelled on the Constitution of the Russian Social Democratic LabourParty. The new _Tsay-ee-kah,_ responsible to frequent meetings of theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets, will be the parliament; the variousMinistries will be headed by _collegia_-committees-instead of byMinisters, and will be directly responsible to the Soviets....On October 30th, by appointment, I went up to a small, bare room inthe attic of Smolny, to talk with Trotzky. In the middle of the roomhe sat on a rough chair at a bare table. Few questions from me werenecessary; he talked rapidly and steadily, for more than an hour. Thesubstance of his talk, in his own words, I give here:"The Provisional Government is absolutely powerless. The bourgeoisieis in control, but this control is masked by a fictitious coalitionwith the _oborontsi_ parties. Now, during the Revolution, one seesrevolts of peasants who are tired of waiting for their promised land;and all over the country, in all the toiling classes, the samedisgust is evident. This domination by the bourgeoisie is onlypossible by means of civil war. The Kornilov method is the only wayby which the bourgeoisie can control. But it is force which thebourgeoisie lacks.... The Army is with us. The conciliators andpacifists, Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki, have lost allauthority-because the struggle between the peasants and thelandlords, between the workers and the employers, between thesoldiers and the officers, has become more bitter, moreirreconcilable than ever. Only by the concerted action of the popularmass, only by the victory of proletarian dictatorship, can theRevolution be achieved and the people saved...."The Soviets are the most perfect representatives of thepeople-perfect in their revolutionary experience, in their ideas andobjects. Based directly upon the army in the trenches, the workers inthe factories, and the peasants in the fields, they are the backboneof the Revolution."There has been an attempt to create a power without the Soviets-andonly powerlessness has been created. Counter-revolutionary schemes ofall sorts are now being hatched in the corridors of the Council ofthe Russian Republic. The Cadet party represents thecounter-revolution militant. On the other side, the Soviets representthe cause of the people. Between the two camps there are no groups ofserious importance.... It is the _lutte finale._ The bourgeoiscounter-revolution organises all its forces and waits for the momentto attack us. Our answer will be decisive. We will complete the workscarcely begun in March, and advanced during the Kornilov affair...."He went on to speak of the new Government's foreign policy:"Our first act will be to call for an immediate armistice on allfronts, and a conference of peoples to discuss democratic peaceterms. The quantity of democracy we get in the peace settlementdepends on the quantity of revolutionary response there is in Europe.If we create here a Government of the Soviets, that will be apowerful factor for immediate peace in Europe; for this Governmentwill address itself directly and immediately to all peoples, over theheads of their Governments, proposing an armistice. At the moment ofthe conclusion of peace the pressure of the Russian Revolution willbe in the direction of 'no annexations,# no indemnities, the right ofself-determination of peoples,' and a _Federated Republic of Europe._..."At the end of this war I see Europe recreated, not by the diplomats,but by the proletariat. The Federated Republic of Europe-the UnitedStates of Europe-that is what must be. National autonomy no longersuffices. Economic evolution demands the abolition of nationalfrontiers. If Europe is to remain split into national groups, thenImperialism will recommence its work. Only a Federated Republic ofEurope can give peace to the world." He smiled-that fine, faintlyironical smile of his. "But without the action of the Europeanmasses, these ends cannot be realised-now...."Now while everybody was waiting for the Bolsheviki to appear suddenlyon the streets one morning and begin to shoot down people with whitecollars on, the real insurrection took its way quite naturally andopenly.The Provisional Government planned to send the Petrograd garrison tothe front.The Petrograd garrison numbered about sixty thousand men, who hadtaken a prominent part in the Revolution. It was they who had turnedthe tide in the great days of March, created the Soviets of Soldiers'Deputies, and hurled back Kornilov from the gates of Petrograd.Now a large part of them were Bolsheviki. When the ProvisionalGovernment talked of evacuating the city, it was the Petrogradgarrison which answered, "If you are not capable of defending thecapital, conclude peace; if you cannot conclude peace, go away andmake room for a People's Government which can do both...."It was evident that any attempt at insurrection depended upon theattitude of the Petrograd garrison. The Government's plan was toreplace the garrison regiments with "dependable" troops-Cossacks,Death Battalions. The Army Committees, the "moderate" Socialists andthe _Tsay-ee-kah_ supported the Government. A wide-spread agitationwas carried on at the Front and in Petrograd, emphasizing the factthat for eight months the Petrograd garrison had been leading an easylife in the barracks of the capital, while their exhausted comradesin the trenches starved and died.Naturally there was some truth in the accusation that the garrisonregiments were reluctant to exchange their comparative comfort forthe hardships of a winter campaign. But there were other reasons whythey refused to go. The Petrograd Soviet feared the Government'sintentions, and from the Front came hundreds of delegates, chosen bythe common soldiers, crying, "It is true we need reinforcements, butmore important, we must know that Petrograd and the Revolution arewell-guarded.... Do you hold the rear, comrades, and we will hold thefront!"On October 25th, behind closed doors, the Central Committee of thePetrograd Soviet discussed the formation of a special MilitaryCommittee to decide the whole question. The next day a meeting of theSoldiers' Section of the Petrograd Soviet elected a Committee, whichimmediately proclaimed a boycott of the bourgeois newspapers, andcondemned the _Tsay-ee-kah_ for opposing the Congress of Soviets. Onthe 29th, in open session of the Petrograd Soviet, Trotzky proposedthat the Soviet formally sanction the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. "We ought," he said, "to create our special organisationto march to battle, and if necessary to die...." It was decided to sendto the front two delegations, one from the Soviet and one from thegarrison, to confer with the Soldiers' Committees and the GeneralStaff.At Pskov, the Soviet delegates were met by General Tcheremissov,commander of the Northern Front, with the curt declaration that hehad ordered the Petrograd garrison to the trenches, and that was all.The garrison committee was not allowed to leave Petrograd....A delegation of the Soldiers' Section of the Petrograd Soviet askedthat a representative be admitted to the Staff of the PetrogradDistrict. Refused. The Petrograd Soviet demanded that no orders beissued without the approval of the Soldiers' Section. Refused. Thedelegates were roughly told, "We only recognise the _Tsay-ee-kah._ Wedo not recognise you; if you break any laws, we shall arrest you."On the 30th a meeting of representatives of all the Petrogradregiments passed a resolution: _"The Petrograd garrison no longerrecognises the Provisional Government. The Petrograd Soviet is ourGovernment. We will obey only the orders of the Petrograd Soviet,through the Military Revolutionary Committee."_ The local militaryunits were ordered to wait for instructions from the Soldiers'Section of the Petrograd Soviet.Next day the _Tsay-ee-kah_ summoned its own meeting, composed largelyof officers, formed a Committee to cooperate with the Staff, anddetailed Commissars in all quarters of the city.A great soldier meeting at Smolny on the 3d resolved:Saluting the creation of the Military Revolutionary Committee, thePetrograd garrison promises it complete support in all its actions,to unite more closely the front and the rear in the interests of theRevolution.The garrison moreover declares that with the revolutionaryproletariat it assures the maintenance of revolutionary order inPetrograd. Every attempt at provocation on the part of theKornilovtsi or the bourgeoisie will be met with merciless resistance.Now conscious of its power, the Military Revolutionary Committeeperemptorily summoned the Petrograd Staff to submit to its control.To all printing plants it gave orders not to publish any appeals orproclamations without the Committee's authorisation. Armed Commissarsvisited the Kronversk arsenal and seized great quantities of arms andammunition, halting a shipment of ten thousand bayonets which wasbeing sent to Novotcherkask, headquarters of Kaledin....Suddenly awake to the danger, the Government offered immunity if theCommittee would disband. Too late. At midnight November 5th Kerenskyhimself sent Malevsky to offer the Petrograd Soviet representation onthe Staff. The Military Revolutionary Committee accepted. An hourlater General Manikovsky, acting Minister of war, countermanded theoffer....Tuesday morning, November 6th, the city was thrown into excitement bythe appearance of a placard signed, "Military Revolutionary Committeeattached to the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies."To the Population of Petrograd. Citizens!Counter-revolution has raised its criminal head. The Kornilovtsi aremobilising their forces in order to crush the All-Russian Congress ofSoviets and break the Constituent Assembly. At the same time the_pogromists_ may attempt to call upon the people of Petrograd fortrouble and bloodshed. The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies takes upon itself the guarding of revolutionary order in thecity against counter-revolutionary and _pogrom_ attempts.The Petrograd garrison will not allow any violence or disorders. Thepopulation is invited to arrest hooligans and Black Hundred agitatorsand take them to the Soviet Commissars at the nearest barracks. Atthe first attempt of the Dark Forces to make trouble on the streetsof Petrograd, whether robbery or fighting, the criminals will bewiped off the face of the earth!Citizens! We call upon you to maintain complete quiet andself-possession. The cause of order and Revolution is in strong hands.List of regiments where there are Commissars of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee....On the 3rd the leaders of the Bolsheviki had another historic meetingbehind closed doors. Notified by Zalkind, I waited in the corridoroutside the door; and Volodarsky as he came out told me what wasgoing on.Lenin spoke: "November 6th will be too early. We must have anall-Russian basis for the rising; and on the 6th all the delegates tothe Congress will not have arrived.... On the other hand, November 8thwill be too late. By that time the Congress will be organised, and itis difficult for a large organised body of people to take swift,decisive action. We must act on the 7th, the day the Congress meets,so that we may say to it, 'Here is the power! What are you going todo with it?'"In a certain upstairs room sat a thin-faced, long-haired individual,once an officer in the armies of the Tsar, then revolutionist andexile, a certain Avseenko, called Antonov, mathematician andchess-player; he was drawing careful plans for the seizure of thecapital.On its side the Government was preparing. Inconspicuously certain ofthe most loyal regiments, from widely-separated divisions, wereordered to Petrograd. The _yunker_ artillery was drawn into theWinter Palace. Patrols of Cossacks made their appearance in thestreets, for the first time since the July days. Polkovnikov issuedorder after order, threatening to repress all insubordination withthe "utmost energy." Kishkin, Minister of Public Instruction, theworsthated member of the Cabinet, was appointed Special Commissar tokeep order in Petrograd; he named as assistants two men no lessunpopular, Rutenburg and Paltchinsky. Petrograd, Cronstadt andFinland were declared in a state of siege-upon which the bourgeois_Novoye Vremya_ (New Times) remarked ironically:Why the state of siege? The Government is no longer a power. It hasno moral authority and it does not possess the necessary apparatus touse force.... In the most favourable circumstances it can onlynegotiate with any one who consents to parley. Its authority goes nofarther....Monday morning, the 5th, I dropped in at the Marinsky Palace, to seewhat was happening in the Council of the Russian Republic. Bitterdebate on Terestchenko's foreign policy. Echoes of theBurtzev-Verkhovski affair. All the diplomats present except theItalian ambassador, who everybody said was prostrated by the Carsodisaster....As I came in, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Karelin was readingaloud an editorial from the London _Times_ which said, "The remedyfor Bolshevism is bullets!" Turning to the Cadets he cried, "That'swhat _you_ think, too!"Voices from the Right, "Yes! Yes!""Yes, I know you think so," answered Karelin, hotly. "But you haven'tthe courage to try it!"Then Skobeliev, looking like a matinée idol with his soft blond beardand wavy yellow hair, rather apologetically defending the Soviet_nakaz._ Terestchenko followed, assailed from the Left by cries of"Resignation! Resignation!" He insisted that the delegates of theGovernment and of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ to Paris should have a commonpoint of view-his own. A few words about the restoration ofdiscipline in the army, about war to victory.... Tumult, and over thestubborn opposition of the truculent Left, the Council of theRepublic passed to the simple order of the day.There stretched the rows of Bolshevik seats-empty since that firstday when they left the Council, carrying with them so much life. As Iwent down the stairs it seemed to me that in spite of the bitterwrangling, no real voice from the rough world outside could penetratethis high, cold hall, and that the Provisional Government waswrecked-on the same rock of War and Peace that had wrecked theMiliukov Ministry.... The doorman grumbled as he put on my coat, "Idon't know what is becoming of poor Russia. All these Mensheviki andBolsheviki and Trudoviki.... This Ukraine and this Finland and theGerman imperialists and the English imperialists. I am forty-fiveyears old, and in all my life I never heard so many words as in thisplace...."In the corridor I met Professor Shatsky, a rat-faced individual in adapper frock-coat, very influential in the councils of the Cadetparty. I asked him what he thought of the much-talked-of Bolshevik_vystuplennie._ He shrugged, sneering."They are cattle-_canaille,"_ he answered. "They will not dare, or ifthey dare they will soon be sent flying. From our point of view itwill not be bad, for then they will ruin themselves and have no powerin the Constituent Assembly...."But, my dear sir, allow me to outline to you my plan for a form ofGovernment to be submitted to the Constituent Assembly. You see, I amchairman of a commission appointed from this body, in conjunctionwith the Provisional Government, to work out a constitutionalproject.... We will have a legislative assembly of two chambers, suchas you have in the United States. In the lower chamber will beterritorial representatives; in the upper, representatives of theliberal professions, zemstvos, Cooperatives-and Trade Unions...."Outside a chill, damp wind came from the west, and the cold mudunderfoot soaked through my shoes. Two companies of _yunkers_ passedswinging up the Morskaya, tramping stiffly in their long coats andsinging an oldtime crashing chorus, such as the soldiers used to singunder the Tsar.... At the first cross-street I noticed that the CityMilitiamen were mounted, and armed with revolvers in bright newholsters; a little group of people stood silently staring at them. Atthe corner of the Nevsky I bought a pamphlet by Lenin, "Will theBolsheviki be Able to Hold the Power?" paying for it with one of thestamps which did duty for small change. The usual street-cars crawledpast, citizens and soldiers clinging to the outside in a way to makeTheodore P. Shonts green with envy.... Along the sidewalk a row ofdeserters in uniform sold cigarettes and sunflower seeds....Up the Nevsky in the sour twilight crowds were battling for thelatest papers, and knots of people were trying to make out themultitudes of appeals (See App. III, Sect. 6) and proclamationspasted in every flat place; from the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the Peasants'Soviets, the "moderate" Socialist parties, the ArmyCommittees-threatening, cursing, beseeching the workers and soldiersto stay home, to support the Government....An armoured automobile went slowly up and down, siren screaming. Onevery corner, in every open space, thick groups were clustered;arguing soldiers and students. Night came swiftly down, thewide-spaced street-lights flickered on, the tides of people flowedendlessly.... It is always like that in Petrograd just before trouble....The city was nervous, starting at every sharp sound. But still nosign from the Bolsheviki; the soldiers stayed in the barracks, theworkmen in the factories.... We went to a moving picture show near theKazan Cathedral-a bloody Italian film of passion and intrigue. Downfront were some soldiers and sailors, staring at the screen inchildlike wonder, totally unable to comprehend why there should be somuch violent running about, and so much homicide....From there I hurried to Smolny. In room 10 on the top floor, theMilitary Revolutionary Committee sat in continuous session, under thechairmanship of a tow-headed, eighteen-year-old boy named Lazimir. Hestopped, as he passed, to shake hands rather bashfully."Peter-Paul Fortress has just come over to us," said he, with apleased grin. "A minute ago we got word from a regiment that wasordered by the Government to come to Petrograd. The men weresuspicious, so they stopped the train at Gatchina and sent adelegation to us. 'What's the matter?' they asked. 'What have you gotto say? We have just passed a resolution, "All Power to theSoviets."'... The Military Revolutionary Committee sent back word,'Brothers! We greet you in the name of the Revolution. Stay where youare until further instructions!'"All telephones, he said, were cut off: but communication with thefactories and barracks was established by means of militarytelephonograph apparatus....A steady stream of couriers and Commissars came and went. Outside thedoor waited a dozen volunteers, ready to carry word to the farthestquarters of the city. One of them, a gypsy-faced man in the uniformof a lieutenant, said in French, "Everything is ready to move at thepush of a button...."There passed Podvoisky, the thin, bearded civillian whose brainconceived the strategy of insurrection; Antonov, unshaven, his collarfilthy, drunk with loss of sleep; Krylenko, the squat, wide-facedsoldier, always smiling, with his violent gestures and tumblingspeech; and Dybenko, the giant bearded sailor with the placid face.These were the men of the hour-and of other hours to come.Downstairs in the office of the Factory-Shop Committees sat Seratov,signing orders on the Government Arsenal for arms-one hundred andfifty rifles for each factory.... Delegates waited in line, forty ofthem....In the hall I ran into some of the minor Bolshevik leaders. Oneshowed me a revolver. "The game is on," he said, and his face waspale. "Whether we move or not the other side knows it must finish usor be finished...."The Petrograd Soviet was meeting day and night. As I came into thegreat hall Trotzky was just finishing."We are asked," he said, "if we intend to have a _vystuplennie._ Ican give a clear answer to that question. The Petrograd Soviet feelsthat at last the moment has arrived when the power must fall into thehands of the Soviets. This transfer of government will beaccomplished by the All-Russian Congress. Whether an armeddemonstration is necessary will depend on... those who wish tointerfere with the All-Russian Congress...."We feel that our Government, entrusted to the personnel of theProvisional Cabinet, is a pitiful and helpless Government, which onlyawaits the sweep of the broom of History to give way to a reallypopular Government. But we are trying to avoid a conflict, even now,to-day. We hope that the All-Russian Congress will take... into itshands that power and authority which rests upon the organised freedomof the people. If, however, the Government wants to utilise the shortperiod it is expected to live-twenty-four, forty eight, orseventy-two hours-to attack us, then we shall answer withcounter-attacks, blow for blow, steel for iron!"Amid cheers he announced that the Left Socialist Revolutionaries hadagreed to send representatives into the Military RevolutionaryCommittee....As I left Smolny, at three o'clock in the morning, I noticed that tworapid-firing guns had been mounted, one on each side of the door, andthat strong patrols of soldiers guarded the gates and the near-bystreet-corners. Bill Shatov [*] came bounding up the steps. "Well," he[* Well known in the American labor movement.]cried, "We're off! Kerensky sent the _yunkers_ to close down ourpapers, _Soldat_ and _Rabotchi Put._ But our troops went down andsmashed the Government seals, and now we're sending detachments toseize the bourgeois newspaper offices!" Exultantly he slapped me onthe shoulder, and ran in....On the morning of the 6th I had business with the censor, whoseoffice was in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Everywhere, on all thewalls, hysterical appeals to the people to remain "calm." Polkovnikovemitted _prikaz_ after _prikaz:_I order all military units and detachments to remain in theirbarracks until further orders from the Staff of the MilitaryDistrict.... All officers who act without orders from their superiorswill be court-martialled for mutiny. I forbid absolutely anyexecution by soldiers of instructions from other organisations....The morning papers announced that the Government had suppressed thepapers _Novaya Rus, Zhivoye Slovo, Rabotchi Put_ and _Soldat,_ anddecreed the arrest of the leaders of the Petrograd Soviet and themembers of the Military Revolutionary Committee....As I crossed the Palace Square several batteries of _yunker_artillery came through the Red Arch at a jingling trot, and drew upbefore the Palace. The great red building of the General Staff wasunusually animated, several armoured automobiles ranked before thedoor, and motors full of officers were coming and going.... The censorwas very much excited, like a small boy at a circus. Kerensky, hesaid, had just gone to the Council of the Republic to offer hisresignation. I hurried down to the Marinsky Palace, arriving at theend of that passionate and almost incoherent speech of Kerensky's,full of self-justification and bitter denunciation of his enemies."I will cite here the most characteristic passage from a whole seriesof articles published in _Rabotchi Put_ by Ulianov-Lenin, a statecriminal who is in hiding and whom we are trying to find.... This statecriminal has invited the proletariat and the Petrograd garrison torepeat the experience of the 16th-18th of July, and insists upon theimmediate necessity for an armed rising.... Moreover, other Bolshevikleaders have taken the floor in a series of meetings, and also madean appeal to immediate insurrection. Particularly should be noticedthe activity of the present president of the Petrograd Soviet,Bronstein-Trotzky...."I ought to bring to your notice... that the expressions and the styleof a whole series of articles in _Rabotchi Put_ and _Soldat_ resembleabsolutely those of _Novaya Rus...._ We have to do not so much with themovement of such and such political party, as with the exploitationof the political ignorance and criminal instincts of a part of thepopulation, a sort of organisation whose object it is to provoke inRussia, cost what it may, an inconscient movement of destruction andpillage; for given the state of mind of the masses, any movement atPetrograd will be followed by the most terrible massacres, which willcover with eternal shame the name of free Russia...."... By the admission of Ulianov-Lenin himself, the situation of theextreme left wing of the Social Democrats in Russia is veryfavourable." (Here Kerensky read the following quotation from Lenin'sarticle.):Think of it!... The German comrades have only one Liebknecht, withoutnewspapers, without freedom of meeting, without a Soviet.... They areopposed by the incredible hostility of all classes of society-and yetthe German comrades try to act; while we, having dozens ofnewspapers, freedom of meeting, the majority of the Soviets, we, thebest-placed international proletarians of the entire world, can werefuse to support the German revolutionists and insurrectionaryorganisations?...Kerensky then continued:"The organisers of rebellion recognise thus implicitly that the mostperfect conditions for the free action of a political party obtainnow in Russia, administered by a Provisional Government at the headof which is, in the eyes of this party, 'a usurper and a man who hassold himself to the bourgeoisie, the Minister-President Kerensky....'"... The organisers of the insurrection do not come to the aid of theGerman proletariat, but of the German governing classes, and theyopen the Russian front to the iron fists of Wilhelm and his friends....Little matter to the Provisional Government the motives of thesepeople, little matter if they act consciously or unconsciously; butin any case, from this tribune, in full consciousness of myresponsibility, I quality such acts of a Russian political party asacts of treason to Russia!"... I place myself at the point of view of the Right, and I proposeimmediately to proceed to an investigation and make the necessaryarrests." (Uproar from the Left.) "Listen to me!" he cried in apowerful voice. "At the moment when the state is in danger, becauseof conscious or unconscious treason, the Provisional Government, andmyself among others, prefer to be killed rather than betray the life,the honour and the independence of Russia...."At this moment a paper was handed to Kerensky."I have just received the proclamation which they are distributing tothe regiments. Here is the contents." Reading: _"'The PetrogradSoviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies is menaced. We orderimmediately the regiments to mobilise on a war footing and to awaitnew orders. All delay or non-execution of this order will beconsidered as an act of treason to the Revolution. The MilitaryRevolutionary Committee. For the President, Podvoisky. The Secretary,Antonov.'_"In reality, this is an attempt to raise the populace against theexisting order of things, to break the Constituent and to open thefront to the regiments of the iron fist of Wilhelm...."I say 'populace' intentionally, because the conscious democracy andits _Tsay-ee-kah,_ all the Army organisations, all that free Russiaglorifies, the good sense, the honour and the conscience of the greatRussian democracy, protests against these things...."I have not come here with a prayer, but to state my firm convictionthat the Provisional Government, which defends at this moment our newliberty-that the new Russian state, destined to a brilliant future,will find unanimous support except among those who have never daredto face the truth...."... The Provisional Government has never violated the liberty of allcitizens of the State to use their political rights.... But now theProvisional Government.... declares: in this moment those elements ofthe Russian nation, those groups and parties who have dared to lifttheir hands against the free will of the Russian people, at the sametime threatening to open the front to Germany, must be liquidatedwith decision!..."Let the population of Petrograd understand that it will encounter afirm power, and perhaps at the last moment good sense, conscience andhonour will triumph in the hearts of those who still possess them...."All through this speech, the hall rang with deafening clamour. Whenthe Minister-President had stepped down, pale-faced and wet withperspiration, and strode out with his suite of officers, speakerafter speaker from the Left and Centre attacked the Right, all oneangry roaring. Even the Socialist Revolutionaries, through Gotz:"The policy of the Bolsheviki is demagogic and criminal, in theirexploitation of the popular discontent. But there is a whole seriesof popular demands which have received no satisfaction up to now....The questions of peace, land and the democratization of the armyought to be stated in such a fashion that no soldier, peasant orworker would have the least doubt that our Government is attempting,firmly and infallibly, to solve them...."We Mensheviki do not wish to provoke a Cabinet crisis, and we areready to defend the Provisional Government with all our energy, tothe last drop of our blood-if only the Provisional Government, on allthese burning questions, will speak the clear and precise wordsawaited by the people with such impatience...."Then Martov, furious:"The words of the Minister-President, who allowed himself to speak of'populace' when it is question of the movement of important sectionsof the proletariat and the army-although led in the wrongdirection-are nothing but an incitement to civil war."The order of the day proposed by the Left was voted. It amountedpractically to a vote of lack of confidence.1. The armed demonstration which has been preparing for some dayspast has for its object a _coup d'etat,_ threatens to provoke civilwar, creates conditions favourable to _pogroms_ andcounterrevolution, the mobilization of counter-revolutionary forces,such as the Black Hundreds, which will inevitably bring about theimpossibility of convoking the Constituent, will cause a militarycatastrophe, the death of the Revolution, paralyse the economic lifeof the country and destroy Russia;2. The conditions favourable to this agitation have been created bydelay in passing urgent measures, as well as objective conditionscaused by the war and the general disorder. It is necessary beforeeverything to promulgate at once a decree transmitting the land tothe peasants' Land Committees, and to adopt an energetic course ofaction abroad in proposing to the Allies to proclaim their peaceterms and to begin peace-parleys;3. To cope with Monarchist manifestations and _pogromist_ movements,it is indispensable to take immediate measures to suppress thesemovements, and for this purpose to create at Petrograd a Committee ofPublic Safety, composed of representatives of the Municipality andthe organs of the revolutionary democracy, acting in contact with theProvisional Government....It is interesting to note that the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries all rallied to this resolution.... When Kerensky sawit, however, he summoned Avksentiev to the Winter Palace to explain.If it expressed a lack of confidence in the Provisional Government,he begged Avksentiev to form a new Cabinet. Dan, Gotz and Avksentiev,the leaders of the "compromisers," performed their last compromise....They explained to Kerensky that it was not meant as a criticism ofthe Government!At the corner of the Morskaya and the Nevsky, squads of soldiers withfixed bayonets were stopping all private automobiles, turning out theoccupants, and ordering them toward the Winter Palace. A large crowdhad gathered to watch them. Nobody knew whether the soldiers belongedto the Government or the Military Revolutionary Committee. Up infront of the Kazan Cathedral the same thing was happening, machinesbeing directed back up the Nevsky. Five or six sailors with riflescame along, laughing excitedly, and fell into conversation with twoof the soldiers. On the sailors' hat bands were _Avrora_ and _ZariaSvobody,_-the names of the leading Bolshevik cruisers of the BalticFleet. One of them said, "Cronstadt is coming!"... It was as if, in1792, on the streets of Paris, some one had said: "The Marseillaisare coming!" For at Cronstadt were twenty-five thousand sailors,convinced Bolsheviki and not afraid to die...._Rabotchi i Soldat_ was just out, all its front page one hugeproclamation: SOLDIERS! WORKERS! CITIZENS!The enemies of the people passed last night to the offensive. TheKornilovists of the Staff are trying to draw in from the suburbs_yunkers_ and volunteer battalions. The Oranienbaum _yunkers_ and theTsarskoye Selo volunteers refused to come out. A stroke of hightreason is being contemplated against the Petrograd Soviet.... Thecampaign of the counter-revolutionists is being directed against theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets on the eve of its opening, againstthe Constituent Assembly, against the people. The Petrograd Soviet isguarding the Revolution. The Military Revolutionary Committee isdirecting the repulse of the conspirators' attack. The entiregarrison and proletariat of Petrograd are ready to deal the enemy ofthe people a crushing blow.The Military Revolutionary Committee decrees:1. All regimental, division and battle-ship Committees, together withthe Soviet Commissars, and all revolutionary organisations, shallmeet in continuous session, concentrating in their hands allinformation about the plans of the conspirators.2. Not one soldier shall leave his division without permission of theCommittee.3. To send to Smolny at once two delegates from each military unitand five from each Ward Soviet.4. All members of the Petrograd Soviet and all delegates to theAll-Russian Congress are invited immediately to Smolny for anextraordinary meeting.Counter-revolution has raised its criminal head.A great danger threatens all the conquests and hopes of the soldiersand workers.But the forces of the Revolution by far exceed those of its enemies.The cause of the People is in strong hands. The conspirators will becrushed.No hesitation or doubts! Firmness, steadfastness, discipline,determination!Long live the Revolution!_The Military Revolutionary Committee._The Petrograd Soviet was meeting continuously at Smolny, a centre ofstorm, delegates falling down asleep on the floor and rising again totake part in the debate, Trotzky, Kameniev, Volodarsky speaking six,eight, twelve hours a day....I went down to room 18 on the first floor where the Bolshevikdelegates were holding caucus, a harsh voice steadily booming, thespeaker hidden by the crowd: "The compromisers say that we areisolated. Pay no attention to them. Once it begins they must bedragged along with us, or else lose their following...."Here he held up a piece of paper. "We are dragging them! A messagehas just come from the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries! Theysay that they condemn our action, but that if the Government attacksus they will not oppose the cause of the proletariat!" Exultantshouting....As night fell the great hall filled with soldiers and workmen, amonstrous dun mass, deep-humming in a blue haze of smoke. The old_Tsay-ee-kah_ had finally decided to welcome the delegates to thatnew Congress which would mean its own ruin-and perhaps the ruin ofthe revolutionary order it had built. At this meeting, however, onlymembers of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ could vote....It was after midnight when Gotz took the chair and Dan rose to speak,in a tense silence, which seemed to me almost menacing."The hours in which we live appear in the most tragic colours," hesaid. "The enemy is at the gates of Petrograd, the forces of thedemocracy are trying to organise to resist him, and yet we awaitbloodshed in the streets of the capital, and famine threatens todestroy, not only our homogeneous Government, but the Revolutionitself...."The masses are sick and exhausted. They have no interest in theRevolution. If the Bolsheviki start anything, that will be the end ofthe Revolution..." (Cries, "That's a lie!)" "The counter-revolutionistsare waiting with the Bolsheviki to begin riots and massacres.... Ifthere is any _vystuplennie,_ there will be no Constituent Assembly...."(Cries, "Lie! Shame!")"It is inadmissible that in the zone of military operations thePetrograd garrison shall not submit to the orders of the Staff.... Youmust obey the orders of the Staff and of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ elected byyou. All Power to the Soviets-that means death! Robbers and thievesare waiting for the moment to loot and burn.... When you have suchslogans put before you, 'Enter the houses, take away the shoes andclothes from the bourgeoisie-'" (Tumult. Cries, "No such slogan! Alie! A lie!") "Well, it may start differently, but it will end thatway!"The _Tsay-ee-kah_ has full power to act, and must be obeyed.... We arenot afraid of bayonets.... The _Tsay-ee-kah_ will defend the Revolutionwith its body...." (Cries, "It was a dead body long ago!")Immense continued uproar, in which his voice could be heardscreaming, as he pounded the desk, "Those who are urging this arecommitting a crime!"Voice: "You committed a crime long ago, when you captured the powerand turned it over to the bourgeoisie!"Gotz, ringing the chairman's bell: "Silence, or I'll have you putout!"Voice: "Try it!" (Cheers and whistling.)"Now concerning our policy about peace." (Laughter.) "UnfortunatelyRussia can no longer support the continuation of the war. There isgoing to be peace, but not permanent peace-not a democratic peace....To-day, at the Council of the Republic, in order to avoid bloodshed,we passed an order of the day demanding the surrender of the land tothe Land Committees and immediate peace negotiations...." (Laughter,and cries, "Too late!")Then for the Bolsheviki, Trotzky mounted the tribune, borne on a waveof roaring applause that burst into cheers and a rising house,thunderous. His thin, pointed face was positively Mephistophelian inits expression of malicious irony."Dan's tactics prove that the masses-the great, dull, indifferentmasses-are absolutely with him!" (Titantic mirth.) He turned towardthe chairman, dramatically. "When we spoke of giving the land to thepeasants, you were against it. We told the peasants, 'If they don'tgive it to you, take it yourselves!' and the peasants followed ouradvice. And now you advocate what we did six months ago...."I don't think Kerensky's order to suspend the death penalty in thearmy was dictated by his ideals. I think Kerensky was persuaded bythe Petrograd garrison, which refused to obey him...."To-day Dan is accused of having made a speech in the Council of theRepublic which proves him to be a secret Bolshevik.... The time maycome when Dan will say that the flower of the Revolution participatedin the rising of July 16th and 18th.... In Dan's resolution to-day atthe Council of the Republic there was no mention of enforcingdiscipline in the army, although that is urged in the propaganda ofhis party...."No. The history of the last seven months shows that the masses haveleft the Mensheviki. The Mensheviki and the Socialist Revolutionariesconquered the Cadets, and then when they got the power, they gave itto the Cadets...."Dan tells you that you have no right to make an insurrection.Insurrection is the right of all revolutionists! When thedown-trodden masses revolt, it is their right...."Then the long-faced, cruel-tongued Lieber, greeted with groans andlaughter."Engels and Marx said that the proletariat had no right to take poweruntil it was ready for it. In a bourgeois revolution like this.... theseizure of power by the masses means the tragic end of theRevolution.... Trotzky, as a Social Democratic theorist, is himselfopposed to what he is now advocating...." (Cries, "Enough! Down withhim!")Martov, constantly interrupted: "The Internationalists are notopposed to the transmission of power to the democracy, but theydisapprove of the methods of the Bolsheviki. This is not the momentto seize the power...."Again Dan took the floor, violently protesting against the action ofthe Military Revolutionary Committee, which had sent a Commissar toseize the office of _Izviestia_ and censor the paper. The wildestuproar followed. Martov tried to speak, but could not be heard.Delegates of the Army and the Baltic Fleet stood up all over thehall, shouting that the Soviet was _their_ Government....Amid the wildest confusion Ehrlich offered a resolution, appealing tothe workers and soldiers to remain calm and not to respond toprovocations to demonstrate, recognising the necessity of immediatelycreating a Committee of Public Safety, and asking the ProvisionalGovernment at once to pass decrees transferring the land to thepeasants and beginning peace negotiations....Then up leaped Volodarsky, shouting harshly that the _Tsay-ee-kah,_on the eve of the Congress, had no right to assume the functions ofthe Congress. The _Tsay-ee-kah_ was practically dead, he said, andthe resolution was simply a trick to bolster up its waning power...."As for us, Bolsheviki, we will not vote on this resolution!"Whereupon all the Bolsheviki left the hall and the resolution waspassed....Toward four in the morning I met Zorin in the outer hall, a rifleslung from his shoulder."We're moving!" (See App. III, Sect. 7) said he, calmly but withsatisfaction. "We pinched the Assistant Minister of Justice and theMinister of Religions. They're down cellar now. One regiment is onthe march to capture the Telephone Exchange, another the TelegraphAgency, another the State Bank. The Red Guard is out...."On the steps of Smolny, in the chill dark, we first saw the RedGuard-a huddled group of boys in workmen's clothes, carrying gunswith bayonets, talking nervously together.Far over the still roofs westward came the sound of scattered riflefire, where the _yunkers_ were trying to open the bridges over theNeva, to prevent the factory workers and soldiers of the Viborgquarter from joining the Soviet forces in the centre of the city; andthe Cronstadt sailors were closing them again....Behind us great Smolny, bright with lights, hummed like a gigantichive....                              Chapter IV                    The Fall of the Provisional GovernmentWEDNESDAY, November 7th, I rose very late. The noon cannon boomedfrom Peter-Paul as I went down the Nevsky. It was a raw, chill day.In front of the State Bank some soldiers with fixed bayonets werestanding at the closed gates."What side do you belong to?" I asked. "The Government?""No more Government," one answered with a grin, "_Slava Bogu!_ Gloryto God!" That was all I could get out of him....The street-cars were running on the Nevsky, men, women and smallboys hanging on every projection. Shops were open, and there seemedeven less uneasiness among the street crowds than there had been theday before. A whole crop of new appeals against insurrection hadblossomed out on the walls during the night-to the peasants, to thesoldiers at the front, to the workmen of Petrograd. One read:FROM THE PETROGRAD MUNICIPAL DUMA:The Municipal Duma informs the citizens that in the extraordinarymeeting of November 6th the Duma formed a Committee of PublicSafety, composed of members of the Central and Ward Dumas, andrepresentatives of the following revolutionary democraticorganizations: The _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the All-Russian ExecutiveCommittee of Peasant Deputies, the Army organisations, the_Tsentroflot,_ the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies (!), the Council of Trade Unions, and others.Members of the Committee of Public Safety will be on duty in thebuilding of the Municipal Duma. Telephones No. 15-40, 223-77, 138-36.November 7th, 1917.Though I didn't realize it then, this was the Duma's declaration ofwar against the Bolsheviki.I bought a copy of _Rabotchi Put,_ the only newspaper which seemedon sale, and a little later paid a soldier fifty kopeks for asecond-hand copy of _Dien._ The Bolshevik paper, printed onlarge-sized sheets in the conquered office of the _Russkaya Volia,_had huge headlines: "ALL POWER-TO THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS, SOLDIERSAND PEASANTS! PEACE! BREAD! LAND!" The leading article was signed"Zinoviev,"-Lenin's companion in hiding. It began:Every soldier, every worker, every real Socialist, every honestdemocrat realises that there are only two alternatives to thepresent situation.Either-the power will remain in the hands of the bourgeois-landlordcrew, and this will mean every kind of repression for the workers,soldiers and peasants, continuation of the war, inevitable hungerand death....Or-the power will be transferred to the hands of the revolutionaryworkers, soldiers and peasants; and in that case it will mean acomplete abolition of landlord tyranny, immediate check of thecapitalists, immediate proposal of a just peace. Then the land isassured to the peasants, then control of industry is assured to theworkers, then bread is assured to the hungry, then the end of thisnonsensical war!..._Dien_ contained fragmentary news of the agitated night. Bolshevikicapture of the Telephone Exchange, the Baltic station, the TelegraphAgency; the Peterhof _yunkers_ unable to reach Petrograd; theCossacks undecided; arrest of some of the Ministers; shooting ofChief of the City Militia Meyer;  arrests, counter-arrests,skirmishes between clashing patrols of soldiers, _yunkers_ and RedGuards. (See App. IV, Sect. 1)On the corner of the Morskaya I ran into Captain Gomberg, Menshevik_oboronetz,_ secretary of the Military Section of his party. When Iasked him if the insurrection had really happened he shrugged hisshoulders in a tired manner and replied, "_Tchort znayet!_ The devilknows! Well, perhaps the Bolsheviki can seize the power, but theywon't be able to hold it more than three days. They haven't the mento run a government. Perhaps it's a good thing to let them try-thatwill furnish them...."The Military Hotel at the corner of St. Isaac's Square was picketedby armed sailors. In the lobby were many of the smart youngofficers, walking up and down or muttering together; the sailorswouldn't let them leave....Suddenly came the sharp crack of a rifle outside, followed by ascattered burst of firing. I ran out. Something unusual was going onaround the Marinsky Palace, where the Council of the RussianRepublic met. Diagonally across the wide square was drawn a line ofsoldiers, rifles ready, staring at the hotel roof."_Provacatzia!_ Shot at us!" snapped one, while another went runningtoward the door.At the western corner of the Palace lay a big armoured car with ared flag flying from it, newly lettered in red paint: "S.R.S.D."(_Soviet Rabotchikh Soldatskikh Deputatov_); all the guns trainedtoward St. Isaac's. A barricade had been heaped up across the mouthof Novaya Ulitza-boxes, barrels, an old bed-spring, a wagon. A pileof lumber barred the end of the Moika quay. Short logs from aneighbouring wood-pile were being built up along the front of thebuilding to form breastworks...."Is there going to be any fighting?" I asked."Soon, soon," answered a soldier, nervously. "Go away, comrade,you'll get hurt. They will come from that direction," pointingtoward the Admiralty."Who will?""That I couldn't tell you, brother," he answered, and spat.Before the door of the Palace was a crowd of soldiers and sailors. Asailor was telling of the end of the Council of the RussianRepublic. "We walked in there," he said, "and filled all the doorswith comrades. I went up to the counter-revolutionist Kornilovitzwho sat in the president's chair. 'No more Council,' I says. 'Runalong home now!"'                                                    |There was laughter. By waving assorted papers I managed to getaround to the door of the press gallery. There an enormous smilingsailor stopped me, and when I showed my pass, just said, "If youwere Saint Michael himself, comrade, you couldn't pass here!"Through the glass of the door I made out the distorted face andgesticulating arms of a French correspondent, locked in....Around in front stood a little, grey-moustached man in the uniformof a general, the centre of a knot of soldiers. He was very red inthe face."I am General Alexeyev," he cried. "As your superior officer and asa member of the Council of the Republic I demand to be allowed topass!" The guard scratched his head, looking uneasily out of thecorner of his eye; he beckoned to an approaching officer, who grewvery agitated when he saw who it was and saluted before he realisedwhat he was doing."_Vashe Vuisokoprevoskhoditelstvo_-your High Excellency-" hestammered, in the manner of the old régime, "Access to the Palace isstrictly forbidden--I have no right-"An automobile came by, and I saw Gotz sitting inside, laughingapparently with great amusement. A few minutes later another, witharmed soldiers on the front seat, full of arrested members of theProvisional Government. Peters, Lettish member of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee, came hurrying across the Square."I thought you bagged all those gentlemen last night," said I,pointing to them."Oh," he answered, with the expression of a disappointed small boy."The damn fools let most of them go again before we made up ourminds...."Down the Voskressensky Prospect a great mass of sailors were drawnup, and behind them came marching soldiers, as far as the eye couldreach.We went toward the Winter Palace by way of the Admiralteisky. Allthe entrances to the Palace Square were closed by sentries, and acordon of troops stretched clear across the western end, besieged byan uneasy throng of citizens. Except for far-away soldiers whoseemed to be carrying wood out of the Palace courtyard and piling itin front of the main gateway, everything was quiet.We couldn't make out whether the sentries were pro-Government orpro-Soviet. Our papers from Smolny had no effect, however, so weapproached another part of the line with an important air and showedour American passports, saying "Official business!" and shoulderedthrough. At the door of the Palace the same old _shveitzari,_ intheir brass-buttoned blue uniforms with the red-and-gold collars,politely took our coats and hats, and we went up-stairs. In thedark, gloomy corridor, stripped of its tapestries, a few oldattendants were lounging about, and in front of Kerensky's door ayoung officer paced up and down, gnawing his moustache. We asked ifwe could interview the Minister-president. He bowed and clicked hisheels."No, I am sorry," he replied in French. "Alexander Feodorvitch isextremely occupied just now...." He looked at us for a moment. "Infact, he is not here....""Where is he?""He has gone to the Front. (See App. IV, Sect. 2) And do you know,there wasn't enough gasoline for his automobile. We had to send tothe English Hospital and borrow some.""Are the Ministers here?""They are meeting in some room-I don't know where.'"Are the Bolsheviki coming?""Of course. Certainly, they are coming. I expect a telephone callevery minute to say that they are coming. But we are ready. We have_yunkers_ in the front of the Palace. Through that door there.""Can we go in there?""No. Certainly not. It is not permitted." Abruptly he shook handsall around and walked away. We turned to the forbidden door, set ina temporary partition dividing the hall and locked on the outside.On the other side were voices, and somebody laughing. Except forthat the vast spaces of the old Palace were silent as the grave. Anold _shveitzar_ ran up. "No, _barin,_ you must not go in there.""Why is the door locked?""To keep the soldiers in," he answered. After a few minutes he saidsomething about having a glass of tea and went back up the hall. Weunlocked the door.Just inside a couple of soldiers stood on guard, but they saidnothing. At the end of the corridor was a large, ornate room withgilded cornices and enormous crystal lustres, and beyond it severalsmaller ones, wainscoted with dark wood. On both sides of theparquetted floor lay rows of dirty mattresses and blankets, uponwhich occasional soldiers were stretched out; everywhere was alitter of cigarette-butts, bits of bread, cloth, and empty bottleswith expensive French labels. More and more soldiers, with the redshoulder-straps of the _yunker_-schools, moved about in a staleatmosphere of tobacco-smoke and unwashed humanity. One had a bottleof white Burgundy, evidently filched from the cellars of the Palace.They looked at us with astonishment as we marched past, through roomafter room, until at last we came out into a series of greatstate-salons, fronting their long and dirty windows on the Square.The walls were covered with huge canvases in massive giltframes-historical battle-scenes.... "12 October 1812" and "6 November1812" and "16/28 August 1813." ... One had a gash across the upperright hand corner.The place was all a huge barrack, and evidently had been for weeks,from the look of the floor and walls. Machine guns were mounted onwindow-sills, rifles stacked between the mattresses.As we were looking at the pictures an alcoholic breath assailed mefrom the region of my left ear, and a voice said in thick but fluentFrench, "I see, by the way you admire the paintings, that you areforeigners." He was a short, puffy man with a baldish head as heremoved his cap."Americans? Enchanted. I am Stabs-Capitan Vladimir Artzibashev,absolutely at your service." It did not seem to occur to him thatthere was anything unusual in four strangers, one a woman, wanderingthrough the defences of an army awaiting attack. He began tocomplain of the state of Russia."Not only these Bolsheviki," he said, "but the fine traditions ofthe Russian army are broken down. Look around you. These are allstudents in the officers' training schools. But are they gentlemen?Kerensky opened the officers' schools to the ranks, to any soldierwho could pass an examination. Naturally there are many, many whoare contaminated by the Revolution...."Without consequence he changed the subject. "I am very anxious to goaway from Russia. I have made up my mind to join the American army.Will you please go to your Consul and make arrangements? I will giveyou my address." In spite of our protestations he wrote it on apiece of paper, and seemed to feel better at once. I have itstill-"_Oranien-baumskaya Shkola Praporshtchikov 2nd, StarayaPeterhof._""We had a review this morning early," he went on, as he guided usthrough the rooms and explained everything. "The Women's Battaliondecided to remain loyal to the Government.""Are the women soldiers in the Palace?""Yes, they are in the back rooms, where they won't be hurt if anytrouble comes." He sighed. "It is a great responsibility," said he.For a while we stood at the window, looking down on the Squarebefore the Palace, where three companies of long-coated _yunkers_were drawn up under arms, being harangued by a tall,energetic-looking officer I recognised as Stankievitch, chiefMilitary Commissar of the Provisional Government. After a fewminutes two of the companies shouldered arms with a clash, barkedthree sharp shouts, and went swinging off across the Square,disappearing through the Red Arch into the quiet city."They are going to capture the Telephone Exchange," said some one.Three cadets stood by us, and we fell into conversation. They saidthey had entered the schools from the ranks, and gave theirnames-Robert Olev, Alexei Vasilienko and Erni Sachs, an Esthonian.But now they didn't want to be officers any more, because officerswere very unpopular. They didn't seem to know what to do, as amatter of fact, and it was plain that they were not happy.But soon they began to boast. "If the Bolsheviki come we shall showthem how to fight. They do not dare to fight, they are cowards. Butif we should be overpowered, well, every man keeps one bullet forhimself...."At this point there was a burst of rifle-fire not far off. Out onthe Square all the people began to run, falling flat on their faces,and the _izvoshtchiki,_ standing on the corners, galloped in everydirection. Inside all was uproar, soldiers running here and there,grabbing up guns, rifle-belts and shouting, "Here they come! Herethey come!" ... But in a few minutes it quieted down again. The_izvoshtchiki_ came back, the people lying down stood up. Throughthe Red Arch appeared the _yunkers,_ marching a little out of step,one of them supported by two comrades.It was getting late when we left the Palace. The sentries in theSquare had all disappeared. The great semi-circle of Governmentbuildings seemed deserted. We went into the Hotel France for dinner,and right in the middle of soup the waiter, very pale in the face,came up and insisted that we move to the main dining-room at theback of the house, because they were going to put out the lights inthe café. "There will be much shooting," he said.When we came out on the Morskaya again it was quite dark, except forone flickering street-light on the corner of the Nevsky. Under thisstood a big armored automobile, with racing engine and oil-smokepouring out of it. A small boy had climbed up the side of the thingand was looking down the barrel of a machine gun. Soldiers andsailors stood around, evidently waiting for something. We walkedback up to the Red Arch, where a knot of soldiers was gatheredstaring at the brightly-lighted Winter Palace and talking in loudtones."No, comrades," one was saying. "How can we shoot at them? TheWomen's Battalion is in there-they will say we have fired on Russianwomen."As we reached the Nevsky again another armoured car came around thecorner, and a man poked his head out of the turret-top."Come on!" he yelled. "Let's go on through and attack!"The driver of the other car came over, and shouted so as to be heardabove the roaring engine. "The Committee says to wait. They have gotartillery behind the wood-piles in there...."Here the street-cars had stopped running, few people passed, andthere were no lights; but a few blocks away we could see the trams,the crowds, the lighted shop-windows and the electric signs of themoving-picture shows-life going on as usual. We had tickets to theBallet at the Marinsky Theatre-all theatres were open-but it was tooexciting out of doors....In the darkness we stumbled over lumber-piles barricading the PoliceBridge, and before the Stroganov Palace made out some soldierswheeling into position a three-inch field-gun. Men in variousuniforms were coming and going in an aimless way, and doing a greatdeal of talking....Up the Nevsky the whole city seemed to be out promenading. On everycorner immense crowds were massed around a core of hot discussion.Pickets of a dozen soldiers with fixed bayonets lounged at thestreet-crossings, red-faced old men in rich fur coats shook theirfists at them, smartly-dressed women screamed epithets; the soldiersargued feebly, with embarrassed grins.... Armoured cars went up anddown the street, named after the first Tsars-Oleg, Rurik,Svietoslav-and daubed with huge red letters, "R. S. D. R. P."_(Rossiskaya Partia_) [*]. At the Mikhailovsky a man appeared with an[* (Russian Social Democratic Labor Party).]armful of newspapers, and was immediately stormed by frantic people,offering a rouble, five roubles, ten roubles, tearing at each otherlike animals. It was _Rabotchi i Soldat,_ announcing the victory ofthe Proletarian Revolution, the liberation of the Bolsheviki stillin prison, calling upon the Army front and rear for support... afeverish little sheet of four pages, running to enormous type,containing no news....On the corner of the Sadovaya about two thousand citizens hadgathered, staring up at the roof of a tall building, where a tinyred spark glowed and waned."See!" said a tall peasant, pointing to it. "It is a provocator.Presently he will fire on the people...." Apparently no one thought ofgoing to investigate.The massive facade of Smolny blazed with lights as we drove up, andfrom every street converged upon it streams of hurrying shapes dimin the gloom. Automobiles and motorcycles came and went; an enormouselephant-coloured armoured automobile, with two red flags flyingfrom the turret, lumbered out with screaming siren. It was cold, andat the outer gate the Red Guards had built themselves a bon-fire. Atthe inner gate, too, there was a blaze, by the light of which thesentries slowly spelled out our passes and looked us up and down.The canvas covers had been taken off the four rapid-fire guns oneach side of the doorway, and the ammunition-belts hung snakelikefrom their breeches. A dun herd of armoured cars stood under thetrees in the court-yard, engines going. The long, bare,dimly-illuminated halls roared with the thunder of feet, calling,shouting.... There was an atmosphere of recklessness. A crowd camepouring down the staircase, workers in black blouses and round blackfur hats, many of them with guns slung over their shoulders,soldiers in rough dirt-coloured coats and grey fur _shapki_ pinchedflat, a leader or so-Lunatcharsky, Kameniev-hurrying along in thecentre of a group all talking at once, with harassed anxious faces,and bulging portfolios under their arms. The extraordinary meetingof the Petrograd Soviet was over. I stopped Kameniev-a quick movinglittle man, with a wide, vivacious face set close to his shoulders.Without preface he read in rapid French a copy of the resolutionjust passed:The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, salutingthe victorious Revolution of the Petrograd proletariat and garrison,particularly emphasises the unity, organisation, discipline, andcomplete cooperation shown by the masses in this rising; rarely hasless blood been spilled, and rarely has an insurrection succeeded sowell.The Soviet expresses its firm conviction that the Workers' andPeasants' Government which, as the government of the Soviets, willbe created by the Revolution, and which will assure the industrialproletariat of the support of the entire mass of poor peasants, willmarch firmly toward Socialism, the only means by which the countrycan be spared the miseries and unheard-of horrors of war.The new Workers' and Peasants' Government will propose immediately ajust and democratic peace to all the belligerent countries.It will suppress immediately the great landed property, and transferthe land to the peasants. It will establish workmen's control overproduction and distribution of manufactured products, and will setup a general control over the banks, which it will transform into astate monopoly.The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies calls uponthe workers and the peasants of Russia to support with all theirenergy and all their devotion the Proletarian Revolution. The Sovietexpresses its conviction that the city workers, allies of the poorpeasants, will assure complete revolutionary order, indispensable tothe victory of Socialism. The Soviet is convinced that theproletariat of the countries of Western Europe will aid us inconducting the cause of Socialism to a real and lasting victory."You consider it won then?"He lifted his shoulders. "There is much to do. Horribly much. It isjust beginning....On the landing I met Riazanov, vice-president of the Trade Unions,looking black and biting his grey beard. "It's insane! Insane!" heshouted. "The European working-class won't move! All Russia-" Hewaved his hand distractedly and ran off. Riazanov and Kameniev hadboth opposed the insurrection, and felt the lash of Lenin's terribletongue....It had been a momentous session. In the name of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee Trotzky had declared that the ProvisionalGovernment no longer existed."The characteristic of bourgeois governments," he said, "is todeceive the people. We, the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' andPeasants' Deputies, are going to try an experiment unique inhistory; we are going to found a power which will have no other aimbut to satisfy the needs of the soldiers, workers, and peasants."Lenin had appeared, welcomed with a mighty ovation, prophesyingworld-wide Social Revolution.... And Zinoviev, crying, "This day wehave paid our debt to the international proletariat, and struck aterrible blow at the war, a terrible body-blow at all theimperialists and particularly at Wilhelm the Executioner....Then Trotzky, that telegrams had been sent to the front announcingthe victorious insurrection, but no reply had come. Troops were saidto be marching against Petrograd-a delegation must be sent to tellthem the truth.Cries, "You are anticipating the will of the All-Russian Congress ofSoviets!"Trotzky, coldly, "The will of the All-Russian Congress of Sovietshas been anticipated by the rising of the Petrograd workers andsoldiers!"So we came into the great meeting-hall, pushing through theclamorous mob at the door. In the rows of seats, under the whitechandeliers, packed immovably in the aisles and on the sides,perched on every window-sill, and even the edge of the platform, therepresentatives of the workers and soldiers of all Russia waited inanxious silence or wild exultation the ringing of the chairman'sbell. There was no heat in the hall but the stifling heat ofunwashed human bodies. A foul blue cloud of cigarette smoke rosefrom the mass and hung in the thick air. Occasionally some one inauthority mounted the tribune and asked the comrades not to smoke;then everybody, smokers and all, took up the cry "Don't smoke,comrades!" and went on smoking. Petrovsky, Anarchist delegate fromthe Obukhov factory, made a seat for me beside him. Unshaven andfilthy, he was reeling from three nights' sleepless work on theMilitary Revolutionary Committee.On the platform sat the leaders of the old _Tsay-ee-kah_-for thelast time dominating the turbulent Soviets, which they had ruledfrom the first days, and which were now risen against them. It wasthe end of the first period of the Russian revolution, which thesemen had attempted to guide in careful ways.... The three greatest ofthem were not there: Kerensky, flying to the front through countrytowns all doubtfully heaving up; Tcheidze, the old eagle, who hadcontemptuously retired to his own Georgian mountains, there tosicken with consumption; and the high-souled Tseretelli, alsomortally stricken, who, nevertheless, would return and pour out hisbeautiful eloquence for a lost cause. Gotz sat there, Dan, Lieber,Bogdanov, Broido, Fillipovsky,-white-faced, hollow-eyed andindignant. Below them the second _siezd_ of the All-Russian Sovietsboiled and swirled, and over their heads the Military RevolutionaryCommittee functioned white-hot, holding in its hands the threads ofinsurrection and striking with a long arm.... It was 10.40 P. M.Dan, a mild-faced, baldish figure in a shapeless military surgeon'suniform, was ringing the bell. Silence fell sharply, intense, brokenby the scuffling and disputing of the people at the door...."We have the power in our hands," he began sadly, stopped for amoment, and then went on in a low voice. "Comrades! The Congress ofSoviets in meeting in such unusual circumstances and in such anextraordinary moment that you will understand why the _Tsay-ee-kah_considers it unnecessary to address you with a political speech.This will become much clearer to you if you will recollect that I ama member of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and that at this very moment ourparty comrades are in the Winter Palace under bombardment,sacrificing themselves to execute the duty put on them by the_Tsay-ee-kah."_ (Confused uproar.)"I declare the first session of the Second Congress of Soviets ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies open!"The election of the presidium took place amid stir and moving about.Avanessov announced that by agreement of the Bolsheviki, LeftSocialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki Internationalists, it wasdecided to base the presidium upon proportionality. SeveralMensheviki leaped to their feet protesting. A bearded soldiershouted at them, "Remember what you did to us Bolsheviki when _we_were the minority!" Result-14 Bolsheviki, 7 SocialistRevolutionaries, 3 Mensheviki and 1 Internationalist (Gorky'sgroup). Hendelmann, for the right and centre SocialistRevolutionaries, said that they refused to take part in thepresidium; the same from Kintchuk, for the Mensheviki; and from theMensheviki Internationalists, that until the verification of certaincircumstances, they too could not enter the presidium. Scatteringapplause and hoots. One voice, "Renegades, you call yourselvesSocialists!" A representative of the Ukrainean delegates demanded,and received, a place. Then the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ stepped down, andin their places appeared Trotzky, Kameniev, Lunatcharsky, MadameKollentai, Nogin.... The hall rose, thundering. How far they hadsoared, these Bolsheviki, from a despised and hunted sect less thanfour months ago, to this supreme place, the helm of great Russia infull tide of insurrection!The order of the day, said Kameniev, was first, Organisation ofPower; second, War and Peace; and third, the Constituent Assembly.Lozovsky, rising, announced that upon agreement of the bureau of allfactions, it was proposed to hear and discuss the report of thePetrograd Soviet, then to give the floor to members of the_Tsay-ee-kah_ and the different parties, and finally to pass to theorder of the day.But suddenly a new sound made itself heard, deeper than the tumultof the crowd, persistent, disquieting,-the dull shock of guns.People looked anxiously toward the clouded windows, and a sort offever came over them. Martov, demanding the floor, croaked hoarsely,"The civil war is beginning, comrades! The first question must be apeaceful settlement of the crisis. On principle and from a politicalstandpoint we must urgently discuss a means of averting civil war.Our brothers are being shot down in the streets! At this moment,when before the opening of the Congress of Soviets the question ofPower is being settled by means of a military plot organised by oneof the revolutionary parties-" for a moment he could not makehimself heard above the noise, "All of the revolutionary partiesmust face the fact! The first _vopros_ (question) before theCongress is the question of Power, and this question is alreadybeing settled by force of arms in the streets!... We must create apower which will be recognised by the whole democracy. If theCongress wishes to be the voice of the revolutionary democracy itmust not sit with folded hands before the developing civil war, theresult of which may be a dangerous outburst of counter-revolution....The possibility of a peaceful outcome lies in the formation of aunited democratic authority.... We must elect a delegation tonegotiate with the other Socialist parties and organisation....Always the methodical muffled boom of cannon through the windows,and the delegates, screaming at each other.... So, with the crash ofartillery, in the dark, with hatred, and fear, and reckless daring,new Russia was being born.The Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the United Social Democratssupported Martov's proposition. It was accepted. A soldier announcedthat the All-Russian Peasants' Soviets had refused to send delegatesto the Congress; he proposed that a committee be sent with a formalinvitation. "Some delegates are present," he said. "I move that theybe given votes." Accepted.Kharash, wearing the epaulets of a captain, passionately demandedthe floor. "The political hypocrites who control this Congress," heshouted, "told us we were to settle the question of Power-and it isbeing settled behind our backs, before the Congress opens! Blows arebeing struck against the Winter Palace, and it is by such blows thatthe nails are being driven into the coffin of the political partywhich has risked such an adventure!" Uproar. Followed him Gharra:"While we are here discussing propositions of peace, there is abattle on in the streets.... The Socialist Revolutionaries and theMensheviki refuse to be involved in what is happening, and call uponall public forces to resist the attempt to capture the power...."Kutchin, delegate of the 12th Army and representative of theTroudoviki: "I was sent here only for information, and I amreturning at once to the Front, where all the Army Committeesconsider that the taking of power by the Soviets, only three weeksbefore the Constituent Assembly, is a stab in the back of the Armyand a crime against the people-!" Shouts of "Lie! You lie!"... When hecould be heard again, "Let's make an end of this adventure inPetrograd! I call upon all delegates to leave this hall in order tosave the country and the Revolution!" As he went down the aisle inthe midst of a deafening noise, people surged in upon him,threatening.... Then Khintchuk, an officer with a long brown goatee,speaking suavely and persuasively: "I speak for the delegates fromthe Front. The Army is imperfectly represented in this Congress, andfurthermore, the Army does not consider the Congress of Sovietsnecessary at this time, only three weeks before the opening of theConstituent-" shouts and stamping, always growing more violent. "TheArmy does not consider that the Congress of Soviets has thenecessary authority-" Soldiers began to stand up all over the hall."Who are you speaking for? What do you represent?" they cried."The Central Executive Committee of the Soviet of the Fifth Army,the Second F- regiment, the First N- Regiment, the Third S- Rifles....""When were you elected? You represent the officers, not thesoldiers! What do the soldiers say about it?" Jeers and hoots."We, the Front group, disclaim all responsibility for what hashappened and is happening, and we consider it necessary to mobiliseall self-conscious revolutionary forces for the salvation of theRevolution! The Front group will leave the Congress.... The place tofight is out on the streets!"Immense bawling outcry. "You speak for the Staff-not for the Army!""I appeal to all reasonable soldiers to leave this Congress!""Kornilovitz! Counter-revolutionist! Provocator!" were hurled at him.On behalf of the Mensheviki, Khintchuk then announced that the onlypossibility of a peaceful solution was to begin negotiations withthe Provisional Government for the formation of a new Cabinet, whichwould find support in all strata of society. He could not proceedfor several minutes. Raising his voice to a shout he read theMenshevik declaration:"Because the Bolsheviki have made a military conspiracy with the aidof the Petrograd Soviet, without consulting the other factions andparties, we find it impossible to remain in the Congress, andtherefore withdraw, inviting the other groups to follow us and tomeet for discussion of the situation!""Deserter!" At intervals in the almost continuous disturbanceHendelman, for the Socialist Revolutionaries, could be heardprotesting against the bombardment of the Winter Palace.... "We areopposed to this kind of anarchy...."Scarcely had he stepped down than a young, lean-faced soldier, withflashing eyes, leaped to the platform, and dramatically lifted hishand:"Comrades!" he cried and there was a hush. "My _familia_ (name) isPeterson-I speak for the Second Lettish Rifles. You have heard thestatements of two representatives of the Army committees; thesestatements would have some value _if their authors had beenrepresentatives of the Army_-" Wild applause. _"But they do notrepresent the soldiers!"_ Shaking his fist. "The Twelfth Army hasbeen insisting for a long time upon the re-election of the GreatSoviet and the Army Committee, but just as your own _Tsay-ee-kah,_our Committee refused to call a meeting of the representatives ofthe masses until the end of September, so that the reactionariescould elect their own false delegates to this Congress. I tell younow, the Lettish soldiers have many times said, 'No moreresolutions! No more talk! We want deeds-the Power must be in ourhands!' Let these impostor delegates leave the Congress! The Army isnot with them!"The hall rocked with cheering. In the first moments of the session,stunned by the rapidity of events, startled by the sound of cannon,the delegates had hesitated. For an hour hammer-blow afterhammer-blow had fallen from that tribune, welding them together butbeating them down. Did they stand then alone? Was Russia risingagainst them? Was it true that the Army was marching on Petrograd?Then this clear-eyed young soldier had spoken, and in a flash theyknew it for the truth.... _This_ was the voice of the soldiers-thestirring millions of uniformed workers and peasants were men likethem, and their thoughts and feelings were the same...More soldiers ... Gzhelshakh; for the Front delegates, announcing thatthey had only decided to leave the Congress by a small majority, andthat _the Bolshevik members had not even taken part in the vote,_ asthey stood for division according to political parties, and notgroups. "Hundreds of delegates from the Front," he said, "are beingelected without the participation of the soldiers because the ArmyCommittees are no longer the real representatives of the rank andfile...." Lukianov, crying that officers like Kharash and Khintchukcould not represent the Army in this congress,-but only the highcommand. "The real inhabitants of the trenches want with all theirhearts the transfer of Power into the hands of the Soviets, and theyexpect very much from it!"... The tide was turning.Then came Abramovitch, for the _Bund,_ the organ of the JewishSocial Democrats-his eyes snapping behind thick glasses, tremblingwith rage."What is taking place now in Petrograd is a monstrous calamity! The_Bund_ group joins with the declaration of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries and will leave the Congress!" He raisedhis voice and hand. "Our duty to the Russian proletariat doesn'tpermit us to remain here and be responsible for these crimes.Because the firing on the Winter Palace doesn't cease, the MunicipalDuma together with the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, andthe Executive Committee of the Peasants' Soviet, has decided toperish with the Provisional Government, and we are going with them!Unarmed we will expose our breasts to the machine guns of theTerrorists.... We invite all delegates to this Congress-" The rest waslost in a storm of hoots, menaces and curses which rose to a hellishpitch as fifty delegates got up and pushed their way out....Kameniev jangled the bell, shouting, "Keep your seats and we'll goon with our business!" And Trotzky, standing up with a pale, cruelface, letting out his rich voice in cool contempt, "All theseso-called Socialist compromisers, these frightened Mensheviki,Socialist Revolutionaries, _Bund_-let them go! They are just so muchrefuse which will be swept into the garbage-heap of history!"Riazanov, for the Bolsheviki, stated that at the request of the CityDuma the Military Revolutionary Committee had sent a delegation tooffer negotiations to the Winter Palace. "In this way we have doneeverything possible to avoid blood-shed...."We hurried from the place, stopping for a moment at the room wherethe Military Revolutionary Committee worked at furious speed,engulfing and spitting out panting couriers, despatching Commissarsarmed with power of life and death to all the corners of the city,amid the buzz of the telephonographs. The door opened, a blast ofstale air and cigarette smoke rushed out, we caught a glimpse ofdishevelled men bending over a map under the glare of a shadedelectric-light.... Comrade Josephov-Dukhvinski, a smiling youth with amop of pale yellow hair, made out passes for us.When we came into the chill night, all the front of Smolny was onehuge park of arriving and departing automobiles, above the sound ofwhich could be heard the far-off slow beat of the cannon. A greatmotor-truck stood there, shaking to the roar of its engine. Men weretossing bundles into it, and others receiving them, with guns besidethem."Where are you going?" I shouted."Down-town-all over-everywhere!" answered a little workman,grinning, with a large exultant gesture.We showed our passes. "Come along!" they invited. "But there'llprobably be shooting-" We climbed in; the clutch slid home with araking jar, the great car jerked forward, we all toppled backward ontop of those who were climbing in; past the huge fire by the gate,and then the fire by the outer gate, glowing red on the faces of theworkmen with rifles who squatted around it, and went bumping at topspeed down the Suvorovsky Prospect, swaying from side to side.... Oneman tore the wrapping from a bundle and began to hurl handfuls of     l handfuls of     |          |papers into the air. We imitated him, plunging down through the darkstreet with a tail of white papers floating and eddying out behind.The late passerby stooped to pick them up; the patrols aroundbonfires on the corners ran out with uplifted arms to catch them.Sometimes armed men loomed up ahead, crying "_Shtoi!_" and raisingtheir guns, but our chauffeur only yelled something unintelligibleand we hurtled on....I picked up a copy of the paper, and under a fleeting street-lightread:TO THE CITIZENS OF RUSSIA!The Provisional Government is deposed. The State Power has passedinto the hands of the organ of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' andSoldiers' Deputies, the Military Revolutionary Committee, whichstands at the head of the Petrograd proletariat and garrison.The cause for which the people were fighting: immediate proposal ofa democratic peace, abolition of landlord property-rights over theland, labor control over production, creation of a SovietGovernment-that cause is securely achieved.LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION OF WORKMEN, SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS!_Military Revolutionary Committee__Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies._[Graphic page-96 Proclamation in Russian, title follows]                                              | _   111_ |Proclamation of the Fall of the Provisional Government issued by theMilitary Revolutionary Committee on the night of November 7th (ourcalendar), which we helped to distribute from a motor-truck justafter the surrender of the Winter Palace.A slant-eyed, Mongolian-faced man who sat beside me, dressed in agoat-skin Caucasian cape, snapped, "Look out! Here the provocatorsalways shoot from the windows!" We turned into Znamensky Square,dark and almost deserted, careened around Trubetskoy's brutal statueand swung down the wide Nevsky, three men standing up with riflesready, peering at the windows. Behind us the street was alive withpeople running and stooping. We could no longer hear the cannon, andthe nearer we drew to the Winter Palace end of the city the quieterand more deserted were the streets. The City Duma was all brightlylighted. Beyond that we made out a dark mass of people, and a lineof sailors, who yelled furiously at us to stop. The machine sloweddown, and we climbed out.It was an astonishing scene. Just at the corner of the EkaterinaCanal, under an arc-light, a cordon of armed sailors was drawnacross the Nevsky, blocking the way to a crowd of people in columnof fours. There were about three or four hundred of them, men infrock coats, well-dressed women, officers-all sorts and conditionsof people. Among them we recognised many of the delegates from theCongress, leaders of the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries;Avksentiev, the lean, red-bearded president of the Peasants'Soviets, Sarokin, Kerensky's spokesman, Khintchuk, Abramovitch; andat the head white-bearded old Schreider, Mayor of Petrograd, andProkopovitch, Minister of Supplies in the Provisional Government,arrested that morning and released. I caught sight of Malkin,reporter for the _Russian Daily News._ "Going to die in the WinterPalace," he shouted cheerfully. The procession stood still, but fromthe front of it came loud argument. Schreider and Prokopovitch werebellowing at the big sailor who seemed in command."We demand to pass!" they cried. "See, these comrades come from theCongress of Soviets! Look at their tickets! We are going to theWinter Palace!"The sailor was plainly puzzled. He scratched his head with anenormous hand, frowning. "I have orders from the Committee not tolet anybody go to the Winter Palace," he grumbled. "But I will senda comrade to telephone to Smolny....""We Insist upon passing! We are unarmed! We will march on whetheryou permit us or not!" cried old Schreider, very much excited."I have orders-" repeated the sailor sullenly."Shoot us if you want to! We will pass! Forward!" came from allsides. "We are ready to die, if you have the heart to fire onRussians and comrades! We bare our breasts to your guns!""No," said the sailor, looking stubborn, "I can't allow you to pass.""What will you do if we go forward? Will you shoot?""No, I'm not going to shoot people who haven't any guns. We won'tshoot unarmed Russian people....""We will go forward! What can you do?""We will do something,"replied the sailor, evidently at a loss. "Wecan't let you pass. We will do something.""What will you do? What will you do?"Another sailor came up, very much irritated. "We will spank you!" hecried, energetically. "And if necessary we will shoot you too. Gohome now, and leave us in peace!"At this there was a great clamour of anger and resentment,Prokopovitch had mounted some sort of box, and, waving his umbrella,he made a speech:"Comrades and citizens!" he said. "Force is being used against us!We cannot have our innocent blood upon the hands of these ignorantmen! It is beneath our dignity to be shot down here in the street byswitchmen-" (What he meant by "switchmen" I never discovered.) "Letus return to the Duma and discuss the best means of saving thecountry and the Revolution!"Whereupon, in dignified silence, the procession marched around andback up the Nevsky, always in column of fours. And taking advantageof the diversion we slipped past the guards and set off in thedirection of the Winter Palace.Here it was absolutely dark, and nothing moved but pickets ofsoldiers and Red Guards grimly intent. In front of the KazanCathedral a three-inch field-gun lay in the middle of the street,slewed sideways from the recoil of its last shot over the roofs.Soldiers were standing in every doorway talking in low tones andpeering down toward the Police Bridge. I heard one voice saying: "Itis possible that we have done wrong...." At the corners patrolsstopped all passersby-and the composition of these patrols wasinteresting, for in command of the regular troops was invariably aRed Guard.... The shooting had ceased.Just as we came to the Morskaya somebody was shouting: "The_yunkers_ have sent word they want us to go and get them out!"Voices began to give commands, and in the thick gloom we made out adark mass moving forward, silent but for the shuffle of feet and theclinking of arms. We fell in with the first ranks.Like a black river, filling all the street, without song or cheer wepoured through the Red Arch, where the man just ahead of me said ina low voice: "Look out, comrades! Don't trust them. They will fire,surely!" In the open we began to run, stooping low and bunchingtogether, and jammed up suddenly behind the pedestal of theAlexander Column."How many of you did they kill?" I asked."I don't know. About ten...."After a few minutes huddling there, some hundreds of men, the armyseemed reassured and without any orders suddenly began again to flowforward. By this time, in the light that streamed out of all theWinter Palace windows, I could see that the first two or threehundred men were Red Guards, with only a few scattered soldiers.Over the barricade of firewood we clambered, and leaping down insidegave a triumphant shout as we stumbled on a heap of rifles throwndown by the _yunkers_ who had stood there. On both sides of the maingateway the doors stood wide open, light streamed out, and from thehuge pile came not the slightest sound.Carried along by the eager wave of men we were swept into the righthand entrance, opening into a great bare vaulted room, the cellar ofthe East wing, from which issued a maze of corridors andstair-cases. A number of huge packing cases stood about, and uponthese the Red Guards and soldiers fell furiously, battering themopen with the butts of their rifles, and pulling out carpets,curtains, linen, porcelain plates, glassware.... One man wentstrutting around with a bronze clock perched on his shoulder;another found a plume of ostrich feathers, which he stuck in hishat. The looting was just beginning when somebody cried, "Comrades!Don't touch anything! Don't take anything! This is the property ofthe People!" Immediately twenty voices were crying, "Stop! Puteverything back! Don't take anything! Property of the People!" Manyhands dragged the spoilers down. Damask and tapestry were snatchedfrom the arms of those who had them; two men took away the bronzeclock. Roughly and hastily the things were crammed back in theircases, and self-appointed sentinels stood guard. It was all utterlyspontaneous. Through corridors and up stair-cases the cry could beheard growing fainter and fainter in the distance, "Revolutionarydiscipline! Property of the People...."We crossed back over to the left entrance, in the West wing. Thereorder was also being established. "Clear the Palace!" bawled a RedGuard, sticking his head through an inner door. "Come, comrades,let's show that we're not thieves and bandits. Everybody out of thePalace except the Commissars, until we get sentries posted."Two Red Guards, a soldier and an officer, stood with revolvers intheir hands. Another soldier sat at a table behind them, with penand paper. Shouts of "All out! All out!" were heard far and nearwithin, and the Army began to pour  through the door, jostling,expostulating, arguing. As each man appeared he was seized by theself-appointed committee, who went through his pockets and lookedunder his coat. Everything that was plainly not his property wastaken away, the man at the table noted it on his paper, and it wascarried into a little room. The most amazing assortment of objectswere thus confiscated; statuettes, bottles of ink, bed-spreadsworked with the Imperial monogram, candles, a small oil-painting,desk blotters, gold-handled swords, cakes of soap, clothes of everydescription, blankets. One Red Guard carried three rifles, two ofwhich he had taken away from _yunkers;_ another had four portfoliosbulging with written documents. The culprits either sullenlysurrendered or pleaded like children. All talking at once thecommittee explained that stealing was not worthy of the people'schampions; often those who had been caught turned around and beganto help go through the rest of the comrades. (See App. IV, Sect. 3)_Yunkers_ came out, in bunches of three or four. The committeeseized upon them with an excess of zeal, accompanying the searchwith remarks like, "Ah, Provocators! Kornilovists!Counter-revolutionists! Murderers of the People!" But there was noviolence done, although the _yunkers_ were terrified. They too hadtheir pockets full of small plunder. It was carefully noted down bythe scribe, and piled in the little room.... The _yunkers_ weredisarmed. "Now, will you take up arms against the People any more?"demanded clamouring voices."No," answered the _yunkers,_ one by one. Whereupon they wereallowed to go free.We asked if we might go inside. The committee was doubtful, but thebig Red Guard answered firmly that it was forbidden. "Who are youanyway?" he asked. "How do I know that you are not all Kerenskys?(There were five of us, two women.)"_Pazhal'st', touarishtchi!_ Way, Comrades!" A soldier and a RedGuard appeared in the door, waving the crowd aside, and other guardswith fixed bayonets. After them followed single file half a dozenmen in civilian dress-the members of the Provisional Government.First came Kishkin, his face drawn and pale, then Rutenberg, lookingsullenly at the floor; Terestchenko was next, glancing sharplyaround; he stared at us with cold fixity.... They passed in silence;the victorious insurrectionists crowded to see, but there were onlya few angry mutterings. It was only later that we learned how thepeople in the street wanted to lynch them, and shots were fired-butthe sailors brought them safely to Peter-Paul....In the meanwhile unrebuked we walked into the Palace. There wasstill a great deal of coming and going, of exploring new-foundapartments in the vast edifice, of searching for hidden garrisons of_yunkers_ which did not exist. We went upstairs and wandered throughroom after room. This part of the Palace had been entered also byother detachments from the side of the Neva. The paintings, statues,tapestries and rugs of the great state apartments were unharmed; inthe offices, however, every desk and cabinet had been ransacked, thepapers scattered over the floor, and in the living rooms beds hadbeen stripped of their coverings and ward-robes wrenched open. Themost highly prized loot was clothing, which the working peopleneeded. In a room where furniture was stored we came upon twosoldiers ripping the elaborate Spanish leather upholstery fromchairs. They explained it was to make boots with....The old Palace servants in their blue and red and gold uniformsstood nervously about, from force of habit repeating, "You can't goin there, _barin!_ It is forbidden-" We penetrated at length to thegold and malachite chamber with crimson brocade hangings where theMinisters had been in session all that day and night, and where the_shveitzari_ had betrayed them to the Red Guards. The long tablecovered with green baize was just as they had left it, under arrest.Before each empty seat was pen and ink and paper; the papers werescribbled over with beginnings of plans of action, rough drafts ofproclamations and manifestos. Most of these were scratched out, astheir futility became evident, and the rest of the sheet coveredwith absent-minded geometrical designs, as the writers satdespondently listening while Minister after Minister proposedchimerical schemes. I took one of these scribbled pages, in the handwriting of Konovalov, which read, "The Provisional Governmentappeals to all classes to support the Provisional Government-"All this time, it must be remembered, although the Winter Palace wassurrounded, the Government was in constant communication with theFront and with provincial Russia. The Bolsheviki had captured theMinistry of War early in the morning, but they did not know of themilitary telegraph office in the attic, nor of the private telephoneline connecting it with the Winter Palace. In that attic a youngofficer sat all day, pouring out over the country a flood of appealsand proclamations; and when he heard that the Palace had fallen, puton his hat and walked calmly out of the building....Interested as we were, for a considerable time we didn't notice achange in the attitude of the soldiers and Red Guards around us. Aswe strolled from room to room a small group followed us, until bythe time we reached the great picture-gallery where we had spent theafternoon with the _yunkers,_ about a hundred men surged in afterus. One giant of a soldier stood in our path, his face dark withsullen suspicion.[Graphic page-104  Doodling by Konavalov, title follows]Facsimile of the beginning of a proclamation, written in pencil byA.I. Konovalov, Minister of Commerce and Industry in he ProvisionalGovernment, and then scratched out as the hopelessness of thesituation became more and more evident. The geometrical figurebeneath was probably idly drawn while the Ministers were waiting forthe end."Who are you?" he growled. "What are you doing here?" The othersmassed slowly around, staring and beginning to mutter._"Provocatori!"_ I heard somebody say. "Looters!" I produced ourpasses from the Military Revolutionary Committee. The soldier tookthem gingerly, turned them upside down and looked at them withoutcomprehension. Evidently he could not read. He handed them back andspat on the floor. _"Bumagi!_ Papers!" said he with contempt. Themass slowly began to close in, like wild cattle around a cowpuncheron foot. Over their heads I caught sight of an officer, lookinghelpless, and shouted to him. He made for us, shouldering his waythrough."I'm the Commissar," he said to me. "Who are you? What is it?" Theothers held back, waiting. I produced the papers."You are foreigners?" he rapidly asked in Franch. "It is verydangerous...." Then he turned to the mob, holding up our documents."Comrades!" he cried. "These people are foreign comrades-fromAmerica. They have come here to be able to tell their countrymenabout the bravery and the revolutionary discipline of theproletarian army!""How do you know that?" replied the big soldier. "I tell you theyare provocators! They say they came here to observe therevolutionary discipline of the proletarian army, but they have beenwandering freely through the Palace, and how do we know they haven'tgot their pockets full of loot?"_"Pravilno!"_ snarled the others, pressing forward."Comrades! Comrades!" appealed the officer, sweat standing out onhis forehead. "I am Commissar of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. Do you trust me? Well, I tell you that these passes aresigned with the same names that are signed to my pass!"He led us down through the Palace and out through a door openingonto the Neva quay, before which stood the usual committee goingthrough pockets... "You have narrowly escaped," he kept muttering,wiping his face."What happened to the Women's Battalion?" we asked."Oh-the women!" He laughed. "They were all huddled up in a backroom. We had a terrible time deciding what to do with them-many werein hysterics, and so on. So finally we marched them up to theFinland Station and put them on a train for Levashovo, where theyhave a camp. (See App. IV, Sect. 4)....We came out into the cold, nervous night, murmurous with obscurearmies on the move, electric with patrols. From across the river,where loomed the darker mass of Peter-Paul, came a hoarse shout....Underfoot the sidewalk was littered with broken stucco, from thecornice of the Palace where two shells from the battleship _Avrora_had struck; that was the only damage done by the bombardment....It was now after three in the morning. On the Nevsky all thestreet-lights were again shining, the cannon gone, and the onlysigns of war were Red Guards and soldiers squatting around fires.The city was quiet-probably never so quiet in its history; on thatnight not a single hold-up occurred, not a single robbery.But the City Duma Building was all illuminated. We mounted to thegalleried Alexander Hall, hung with its great, gold-framed,red-shrouded Imperial portraits. About a hundred people were groupedaround the platform, where Skobeliev was speaking. He urged that theCommittee of Public Safety be expanded, so as to unite all theanti-Bolshevik elements in one huge organisation, to be called theCommittee for Salvation of Country and Revolution. And as we lookedon, the Committee for Salvation was formed-that Committee which wasto develop into the most powerful enemy of the Bolsheviki,appearing, in the next week, sometimes under its own partisan name,and sometimes as the strictly non-partisan Committee of PublicSafety....Dan, Gotz, Avkesntiev were there, some of the insurgent Sovietdelegates, members of the Executive Committee of the Peasants'Soviets, old Prokopovitch, and even members of the  Council of theRepublic-among whom Vinaver and other Cadets. Lieber cried that theconvention of Soviets was not a legal convention, that the old_Tsay-ee-kah_ was still in office.... An appeal to the country wasdrafted.We hailed a cab. "Where to?" But when we said "Smolny," the_izvoshtchik_ shook his head. _"Niet!"_ said he, "there aredevils...." It was only after weary wandering that we found a driverwilling to take us-and he wanted thirty rubles, and stopped twoblocks away.The windows of Smolny were still ablaze, motors came and went, andaround the still-leaping fires the sentries huddled close, eagerlyasking everybody the latest news. The corridors were full ofhurrying men, hollow-eyed and dirty. In some of the committee-roomspeople lay sleeping on the floor, their guns beside them. In spiteof the seceding delegates, the hall of meetings was crowded withpeople, roaring like the sea. As we came in, Kameniev was readingthe list of arrested Ministers. The name of Terestchenko was greetedwith thunderous applause, shouts of satisfaction, laughter;Rutenburg came in for less; and at the mention of Paltchinsky, astorm of hoots, angry cries, cheers burst forth.... It was announcedthat Tchudnovsky had been appointed Commissar of the Winter Palace.Now occurred a dramatic interruption. A big peasant, his beardedface convulsed with rage, mounted the platform and pounded with hisfist on the presidium table."We, Socialist Revolutionaries, insist upon the immediate release ofthe Socialist Ministers arrested in the Winter Palace! Comrades! Doyou know that four comrades who risked their lives and their freedomfighting against tyranny of the Tsar, have been flung intoPeter-Paul prison-the historical tomb of Liberty?" In the uproar hepounded and yelled. Another delegate climbed up beside him, andpointed at the presidium."Are the representatives of the revolutionary masses going to sitquietly here while the _Okhrana_ of the Bolsheviki tortures theirleaders?"Trotzky was gesturing for silence. "These 'comrades' who are nowcaught plotting the crushing of the Soviets with the adventurerKerensky-is there any reason to handle them with gloves? After July16th and 18th they didn't use much ceremony with us!" With atriumphant ring in his voice he cried, "Now that the _oborontsi_ andthe faint-hearted have gone, and the whole task of defending andsaving the Revolution rests on our shoulders, it is particularlynecessary to work-work-work! We have decided to die rather than giveup!"Followed him a Commissar from Tsarskoye Selo, panting and coveredwith the mud of his ride. "The garrison of Tsarskoye Selo is onguard at the gates of Petrograd, ready to defend the Soviets and theMilitary Revolutionary Committee!" Wild cheers. "The Cycle Corpssent from the front has arrived at Tsarskoye, and the soldiers arenow with us; they recognise the power of the Soviets, the necessityof immediate transfer of land to the peasants and industrial controlto the workers. The Fifth Battalion of Cyclists, stationed atTsarskoye, is ours....Then the delegate of the Third Cycle Battalion. In the midst ofdelirious enthusiasm he told how the cycle corps had been ordered_three days before_ from the South-west front to the "defence ofPetrograd." They suspected, however, the meaning of the order; andat the station of Peredolsk were met by representatives of the FifthBattalion from Tsarskoye. A joint meeting was held, and it wasdiscovered that "among the cyclists not a single man was foundwilling to shed the blood of his brothers, or to support aGovernment of bourgeois and land-owners!"Kapelinski, for the Mensheviki Internationalists, proposed to electa special committee to find a peaceful solution to the civil war."There isn't any peaceful solution!" bellowed the crowed. "Victoryis the only solution!" The vote was overwhelmingly against, and theMensheviki Internationalists left the Congress in a Whirlwind ofJocular insults. There was no longer any panic fear.... Kameniev fromthe platform shouted after them, "The Mensheviki Internationalistsclaimed 'emergency' for the question of a 'peaceful solution,' butthey always voted for suspension of the order of the day in favourof declarations of factions which wanted to leave the Congress. Itis evident," finished Kameniev, "that the withdrawal of all theserenegades was decided upon beforehand!"The assembly decided to ignore the withdrawal of the factions, andproceed to the appeal to the workers, soldiers and peasants of allRussia:TO WORKERS, SOLDIERS AND PEASANTSThe Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies has opened. It represents the great majority of theSoviets. There are also a number of Peasant deputies. Based upon thewill of the great majority of the workers', soldiers and peasants,based upon the triumphant uprising of the Petrograd workmen andsoldiers, the Congress assumes the Power.The Provisional Government is deposed. Most of the members of theProvisional Government are already arrested.The Soviet authority will at once propose an immediate democraticpeace to all nations, and an immediate truce on all fronts. It willassure the free transfer of landlord, crown and monastery lands tothe Land Committees, defend the soldiers rights, enforcing acomplete democratisation of the Army, establish workers' controlover production, ensure the convocation of the Constituent Assemblyat the proper date, take means to supply bread to the cities andarticles of first necessity to the villages, and secure to allnationalities living in Russia a real right to independent existence.The Congress resolves: that all local power shall be transferred tothe Soviets of Workers,' Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, whichmust enforce revolutionary order.The Congress calls upon the soldiers in the trenches to be watchfuland steadfast. The Congress of Soviets is sure that therevolutionary Army will know how to defend the Revolution againstall attacks of Imperialism, until the new Government shall havebrought about the conclusion of the democratic peace which it willdirectly propose to all nations. The new Government will take allnecessary steps to secure everything needful to the revolutionaryArmy, by means of a determined policy of requisition and taxation ofthe propertied classes, and also to improve the situation ofsoldiers' families.The Kornilovitz-Kerensky, Kaledin and others, are endeavouring tolead troops against Petrograd. Several regiments, deceived byKerensky, have sided with the insurgent People.Soldiers! Make active resistance to the Kornilovitz-Kerensky! Be onguard!Railway men! Stop all troop-trains being sent by Kerensky againstPetrograd!Soldiers, Workers, Clerical employees! The destiny of the Revolutionand democratic peace is in your hands!Long live the Revolution!_The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of__Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.__Delegates from the Peasants' Soviets._It was exactly 5:17 A.M. when Krylenko, staggering with fatigue,climbed to the tribune with a telegram in his hand."Comrades! From the Northern Front. The Twelfth Army sends greetingsto the Congress of Soviets, announcing the formation of a MilitaryRevolutionary Committee which has taken over the command of theNorthern Front!" Pandemonium, men weeping, embracing each other."General Tchermissov has recognised the Committee-Commissar of theProvisional Government Voitinsky has resigned!"So. Lenin and the Petrograd workers had decided on insurrection, thePetrograd Soviet had overthrown the Provisional Government, andthrust the _coup d'etat_ upon the Congress of Soviets. Now there wasall great Russia to win-and then the world! Would Russia follow andrise? And the world-what of it? Would the peoples answer and rise, ared world-tide?Although it was six in the morning, night was yet heavy and chill.There was only a faint unearthly pallor stealing over the silentstreets, dimming the watch-fires, the shadow of a terrible dawngrey-rising over Russia....                              Chapter V                            Plunging AheadTHURSDAY, November 8th. Day broke on a city in the wildestexcitement and confusion, a whole nation having up in long hissingswells of storm. Superficially all was quiet; hundreds of thousandsof people retired at a prudent hour, got up early, and went to work.In Petrograd the street-cars were running, the stores andrestaurants open, theatres going, an exhibition of paintingsadvertised.... All the complex routine of common life-humdrum even inwar-time-proceeded as usual. Nothing is so astounding as thevitality of the social organism-how it persists, feeding itself,clothing itself, amusing itself, in the face of the worstcalamities....The air was full of rumours about Kerensky, who was said to haveraised the Front, and to be leading a great army against thecapital. _Volia Naroda_ published a _prikaz_ launched by him atPskov:The disorders caused by the insane attempt of the Bolsheviki placethe country on the verge of a precipice, and demand the effort ofour entire will, our courage and the devotion of every one of us, towin through the terrible trial which the fatherland is undergoing....Until the declaration of the composition of the new Government-ifone is formed-every one ought to remain at his post and fulfil hisduty toward bleeding Russia. It must be remembered that the leastinterference with existing Army organisations can bring onirreparable misfortunes, by opening the Front to the enemy.Therefore it is indispensable to preserve at any price the morale ofthe troops, by assuring complete order and the preservation of theArmy from new shocks, and by maintaining absolute confidence betweenofficers and their subordinates. I order all the chiefs andCommissars, in the name of the safety of the country, to stay attheir posts, as I myself retain the post of Supreme Commander, untilthe Provisional Government of the Republic shall declare its will....In answer, this placard on all the walls:FROM THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS"The ex-Ministers Konovalov, Kishkin, Terestchenko, Maliantovitch,Nikitin and others have been arrested by the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. Kerensky has fled. All Army organisations are ordered totake every measure for the immediate arrest of Kerensky and hisconveyance to Petrograd."All assistance given to Kerensky will be punished as a seriouscrime against the state."With brakes released the Military Revolutionary Committee whirled,throwing off orders, appeals, decrees, like sparks. (See App. V,Sect. 1)... Kornilov was ordered brought to Petrograd. Members of thePeasant Land Committees imprisoned by the Provisional Governmentwere declared free. Capital punishment in the army was abolished.Government employees were ordered to continue their work, andthreatened with severe penalties if they refused. All pillage,disorder and speculation were forbidden under pain of death.Temporary Commissars were appointed to the various Ministries:Foreign Affairs, Vuritsky and Trotzky; Interior and Justice, Rykov;Labor, Shliapnikov; Finance, Menzhinsky; Public Welfare, MadameKollontai; Commerce, Ways and Communications, Riazanov; Navy, thesailor Korbir; Posts and Telegraphs, Spiro; Theatres, Muraviov;State Printing Office, Gherbychev; for the City of Petrograd,Lieutenant Nesterov; for the Northern Front, Pozern....To the Army, appeal to set up Military Revolutionary Committees. Tothe railway workers, to maintain order, especially not to delay thetransport of food to the cities and the front.... In return, they werepromised representation in the Ministry of Ways and Communications.Cossack brothers! (said one proclamation). You are being led againstPetrograd. They want to force you into battle with the revolutionaryworkers and soldiers of the capital. Do not believe a word that issaid by our common enemies, the land-owners and the capitalists.At our Congress are represented all the conscious organisations ofworkers, soldiers and peasants of Russia. The Congress wishes alsoto welcome into its midst the worker-Cossacks. The Generals of theBlack Band, henchmen of the land-owners, of Nicolai the Cruel, areour enemies.They tell you that the Soviets wish to confiscate the lands of theCossacks. This is a lie. It is only from the great Cossack landlordsthat the Revolution will confiscate the land to give it to thepeople.Organise Soviets of Cossacks' Deputies! Join with the Soviets ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies!Show the Black Band that you are not traitors to the People, andthat you do not wish to be cursed by the whole of revolutionaryRussia!...Cossack brothers, execute no orders of the enemies of the people.Send your delegates to Petrograd to talk it over with us.... TheCossacks of the Petrograd garrison, to their honour, have notjustified the hope of the People's enemies....Cossack brothers! The All-Russian Congress of Soviets extends to youa fraternal hand. Long live the brotherhood of the Cossacks with thesoldiers, workers and peasants of all Russia!On the other side, what a storm of proclamations posted up,hand-bills scattered everywhere, newspapers-screaming and cursingand prophesying evil. Now raged the battle of the printing press-allother weapons being in the hands of the Soviets.First, the appeal of the Committee for Salvation of Country andRevolution, flung broadcast over Russia and Europe:TO THE CITIZENS OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC!Contrary to the will of the revolutionary masses, on November 7ththe Bolsheviki of Petrograd criminally arrested part of theProvisional Government, dispersed the Council of the Republic, andproclaimed an illegal power. Such violence committed against theGovernment of revolutionary Russia at the moment of its greatestexternal danger, is an indescribable crime against the fatherland.The insurrection of the Bolsheviki deals a mortal blow to the causeof national defence, and postpones immeasurably the moment of peaceso greatly desired.Civil war, begun by the Bolsheviki, threatens to deliver the countryto the horrors of anarchy and counter-revolution, and cause thefailure of the Constituent Assembly, which must affirm therepublican régime and transmit to the People forever their right tothe land.Preserving the continuity of the only legal Governmental power, theCommittee for Salvation of Country and Revolution, established onthe night of November 7th, takes the initiative in forming a newProvisional Government; which, basing itself on the forces ofdemocracy, will conduct the country to the Constituent Assembly andsave it from anarchy and counter-revolution. The Committee forSalvation summons you, citizens, to refuse to recognise the power ofviolence. Do not obey its orders!Rise for the defence of the country and Revolution!Support the Committee for Salvation!Signed by the Council of the Russian Republic, the Municipal Duma ofPetrograd, the _Tsay-ee-kah (First Congress),_ the ExecutiveCommittee of the Peasants' Soviets, and from the Congress itself theFront group, the factions of Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviki,Populist Socialists, Unified Social Democrats, and the group"Yedinstvo."Then posters from the Socialist Revolutionary party, the Mensheviki_oborontsi,_ Peasants' Soviets again; from the Central ArmyCommittee, the _Tsentroflot_....... Famine will crush Petrograd! (they cried). The German armies willtrample on our liberty. Black Hundred _pogroms_ will spread overRussia, if we all-conscious workers, soldiers, citizens-do notunite....Do not trust the promises of the Bolsheviki! The promise ofimmediate peace-is a lie! The promise of bread-a hoax! The promiseof land-a fairy tale!...They were all in this manner.Comrades! You have been basely and cruelly deceived! The seizure ofpower has been accomplished by the Bolsheviki alone.... They concealedtheir plot from the other Socialist parties composing the Soviet....You have been promised land and freedom, but the counter-revolutionwill profit by the anarchy called forth by the Bolsheviki, and willdeprive you of land and freedom....The newspapers were as violent.Our duty (said the _Dielo Naroda_) is to unmask these traitors tothe working-class. Our duty is to mobilise all our forces and mountguard over the cause of the Revolution!..._Izviestia,_ for the last time speaking in the name of the old_Tsay-ee-kah,_ threatened awful retribution.As for the Congress of Soviets, we affirm that there has been noCongress of Soviets! We affirm that it was merely a privateconference of the Bolshevik faction! And in that case, they have noright to cancel the powers of the _Tsay-ee-kah_...._Novaya Zhizn,_ while pleading for a new Government that shouldunite all the Socialist parties, criticised severely the action ofthe Socialist Revolutionaries and the Mensheviki in quitting theCongress, and pointed out that the Bolshevik insurrection meant onething very clearly: that all illusions about coalition with thebourgeoisie were henceforth demonstrated vain..._Rabotchi Put_ blossomed out as _Pravda,_ Lenin's newspaper whichhad been suppressed in July. It crowed, bristling:Workers, soldiers, peasants! In March you struck down the tyranny ofthe clique of nobles. Yesterday you struck down the tyranny of thebourgeois gang....The first task now is to guard the approaches to Petrograd.The second is definitely to disarm the counter-revolutionaryelements of Petrograd.The third is definitely to organise the revolutionary power andassure the realisation of the popular programme...What few Cadet organs appeared, and the bourgeoisie generally,adopted a detached, ironical attitude toward the whole business, asort of contemptuous "I-told-you-so" to the other parties.Influential Cadets were to be seen hovering around the MunicipalDuma, and on the outskirts of the Committee for Salvation. Otherthan that, the bourgeoisie lay low, biding its hour-which could notfar off. That the Bolsheviki would remain in power longer than threedays never occurred to anybody-except perhaps to Lenin, Trotzky, thePetrograd workers and the simpler soldiers....In the high, amphitheatrical Nicolai Hall that afternoon I saw theDuma sitting in _permanence,_ tempestuous, grouping around it allthe forces of opposition. The old Mayer, Schreider, majestic withhis white hair and beard, was describing his visit to Smolny thenight before, to protest in the name of the MunicipalSelf-Government. "The Duma, being the only existing legal Governmentin the city, elected by equal, direct and secret suffrage, would notrecognise the new power," he had told Trotzky. And Trotzky hadanswered, "There is a constitutional remedy for that. The Duma canbe dissolved and re-elected...." At this report there was a furiousoutcry."If one recognises a Government by bayonet," continued the old man,addressing the Duma, "well, we have one; but I consider legitimateonly a Government recognised by the majority, and not one created bythe usurpation of a minority!" Wild applause on all benches exceptthose of the Bolsheviki. Amid renewed tumult the Mayor announcedthat the Bolsheviki already were violating Municipal autonomy byappointing Commissars in many departments.The Bolshevik speaker shouted, trying to make himself heard, thatthe decision of the Congress of Soviets meant that all Russia backedup the action of the Bolsheviki."You!" he cried. "You are not the real representative of the peopleof Petrograd!" Shrieks of "Insult! Insult!" The old Mayor, withdignity, reminded him that the Duma was elected by the freestpossible popular vote. "Yes," he answered, "but that was a long timeago-like the _Tsay-ee-kah_-like the Army Committee.""There has been no new Congress of Soviets!" they yelled at him."The Bolshevik faction refuses to remain any longer in this nest ofcounter-revolution-" Uproar. "-and we demand a re-election of theDuma...." Whereupon the Bolsheviki left the chamber, followed by criesof "German agents! Down with the traitors!"Shingariov, Cadet, then demanded that all Municipal functionarieswho had consented to be Commissars of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee be discharged from their position and indicted. Schreiderwas on his feet, putting a motion to the effect that the Dumaprotested against the menace of the Bolsheviki to dissolve it, andas the legal representative of the population, it would refuse toleave its post.Outside, the Alexander Hall was crowded for the meeting of theCommittee for Salvation, and Skobeliev was again speaking. "Neveryet," he said, "was the fate of the Revolution so acute, never yetdid the question of the existence of the Russian state excite somuch anxiety, never yet did history put so harshly and categoricallythe question-is Russia to be or not to be! The great hour for thesalvation of the Revolution has arrived, and in consciousnessthereof we observe the close union of the live forces of therevolutionary democracy, by whose organised will a centre for thesalvation of the country and the Revolution has already beencreated...." And much of the same sort. "We shall die sooner thansurrender our post!"Amid violent applause it was announced that the Union of RailwayWorkers had joined the Committee for Salvation. A few moments laterthe Post and Telegraph Employees came in; then some MenshevikiInternationalists entered the hall, to cheers. The Railway men saidthey did not recognise the Bolsheviki and had taken the entirerailroad apparatus into their own hands, refusing to entrust it toany usurpatory power. The Telegraphers' delegate declared that theoperators had flatly refused to work their instruments as long asthe Bolshevik Commissar was in the office. The Postmen would notdeliver or accept mail at Smolny.... All the Smolny telephones werecut off. With great glee it was reported how Uritzky had gone to theMinistry of Foreign Affairs to demand the secret treaties, and howNeratov had put him out. The Government employees were all stoppingwork....It was war-war deliberately planned, Russian fashion; war by strikeand sabotage. As we sat there the chairman read a list of names andassignments; so-and-so was to make the round of the Ministries;another was to visit the banks; some ten or twelve were to work thebarracks and persuade the soldiers to remain neutral-"Russiansoldiers, do not shed the blood of your brothers!"; a committee wasto go and confer with Kerensky; still others were despatched toprovincial cities, to form branches of the Committee for Salvation,and link together the anti-Bolshevik elements.The crowd was in high spirits. "These Bolsheviki _will_ try todictate to the _intelligentzia?_ We'll show them!"... Nothing could bemore striking than the contrast between this assemblage and theCongress of Soviets. There, great masses of shabby soldiers, grimyworkmen, peasants-poor men, bent and scarred in the brute strugglefor existence; here the Menshevik and Social Revolutionaryleaders-Avksentievs, Dans, Liebers,-the former SocialistMinisters-Skobelievs, Tchernovs,-rubbed shoulders with Cadets likeoily Shatsky, sleek Vinaver; with journalists, students,intellectuals of almost all camps. This Duma crowd was well-fed,well-dressed; I did not see more than three proletarians among themall....News came. Kornilov's faithful _Tekhintsi_  [*] had slaughtered his[* See Notes and Explanations]guards at Bykhov, and he had escaped. Kaledin was marching north....The Soviet of Moscow had set up a Military Revolutionary Committee,and was negotiating with the commandant of the city for possessionof the arsenal, so that the workers might be armed.With these facts was mixed an astounding jumble of rumours,distortions, and plain lies. For instance, an intelligent youngCadet, formerly private secretary to Miliukov and then toTerestchenko, drew us aside and told us all about the taking of theWinter Palace."The Bolsheviki were led by German and Austrian officers," heaffirmed."Is that so?" we replied, politely. "How do you know?""A friend of mine was there and saw them.""How could he tell they were German officers?""Oh, because they wore German uniforms!"There were hundreds of such absurd tales, and they were not onlysolemnly published by the anti-Bolshevik press, but believed by themost unlikely persons-Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki whohad always been distinguished by their sober devotion to facts....But more serious were the stories of Bolshevik violence andterrorism. For example, it was said printed that the Red Guards hadnot only thoroughly looted the Winter Palace, but that they hadmassacred the _yunkers_ after disarming them, had killed some of theMinisters in cold blood; and as for the woman soldiers, most of themhad been violated, and many had committed suicide because of thetortures they had gone through.... All these stories were swallowedwhole by the crowd in the Duma. And worse still, the mothers andfathers of the students and of the women read these frightfuldetails, _often accompanied by lists of names,_ and toward nightfallthe Duma began to be besieged by frantic citizens....A typical case is that of Prince Tumanov, whose body, it wasannounced in many newspapers, had been found floating in the MoikaCanal. A few hours later this was denied by the Prince's family, whoadded that the Prince was under arrest so the press identified thedead man as General Demissov. The General having also come to life,we investigated, and could find no trace of any body found whatever....As we left the Duma building two boy scouts were distributinghand-bills (See App. V, Sect. 2) to the enormous crowd which blockedthe Nevsky in front of the door-a crowd composed almost entirely ofbusiness men, shop-keepers, _tchinouniki,_ clerks. One read!FROM THE MUNICIPAL DUMAThe Municipal Duma in its meeting of October 26th, in view of theevents of the day decrees: To announce the inviolability of privatedwellings. Through the House Committees it calls upon the populationof the town of Petrograd to meet with decisive repulse all attemptsto enter by force private apartments, not stopping at the use ofarms, in the interests of the self-defence of citizens.Up on the corner of the Liteiny, five or six Red Guards and a coupleof sailors had surrounded a news-dealer and were demanding that hehand over his copies of the Menshevik _Rabot-chaya Gazeta_ (Workers'Gazette). Angrily he shouted at them, shaking his fist, as one ofthe sailors tore the papers from his stand. An ugly crowd hadgathered around, abusing the patrol. One little workman keptexplaining doggedly to the people and the news-dealer, over and overagain, "It has Kerensky's proclamation in it. It says we killedRussian people. It will make bloodshed...."Smolny was tenser than ever, if that were possible. The same runningmen in the dark corridors, squads of workers with rifles, leaderswith bulging portfolios arguing, explaining, giving orders as theyhurried anxiously along, surrounded by friends and lieutenants. Menliterally out of themselves, living prodigies of sleeplessness andwork-men unshaven, filthy, with burning eyes, who drove upon theirfixed purpose full speed on engines of exaltation. So much they hadto do, so much! Take over the Government, organise the City, keepthe garrison loyal, fight the Duma and the Committee for Salvation,keep out the Germans, prepare to do battle with Kerensky, inform theprovinces what had happened, Propagandise from Archangel toVladivostok.... Government and Municipal employees refusing to obeytheir Commissars, post and telegraph refusing them communication,railroads roads stonily ignoring their appeals for trains, Kerenskycoming, the garrison not altogether to be trusted, the Cossackswaiting to come out.... Against them not only the organisedbourgeoisie, but all the other Socialist parties except the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries, a few Mensheviki Internationalists andthe Social Democrat Internationalists, and even they undecidedwhether to stand by or not. With them, it is true, the workers andthe soldier-masses-the peasants an unknown quantity-but after allthe Bolsheviki were a political faction not rich in trained andeducated men....Riazanov was coming up the front steps, explaining in a sort ofhumorous panic that he, Commissar of Commerce, knew nothing whateverof business. In the upstairs cafe sat a man all by himself in thecorner, in a goat-skin cape and clothes which had been-I was goingto say "slept in," but of course he hadn't slept-and a three days'growth of beard. He was anxiously figuring on a dirty envelope, andbiting his pencil meanwhile. This was Menzhinsky, Commissar ofFinance, whose qualifications were that he had once been clerk in aFrench bank.... And these four half-running down the hall from theoffice of the Military Revolutionary Committee, and scribbling onbits of paper as they run-these were Commissars despatched to thefour corners of Russia to carry the news, argue, or fight-withwhatever arguments or weapons came to hand....The Congress was to meet at one o'clock, and long since the greatmeeting-hall had filled, but by seven there was yet no sign of thepresidium.... The Bolshevik and Left Social Revolutionary factionswere in session in their own rooms. All the livelong afternoon Leninand Trotzky had fought against compromise. A considerable part ofthe Bolsheviki were in favour of giving way so far as to create ajoint all-Socialist government. "We can't hold on!" they cried."Too much is against us. We haven't got the men. We will beisolated, and the whole thing will fall." So Kameniev, Riazanov andothers.But Lenin, with Trotzky beside him, stood firm as a rock. "Let thecompromisers accept our programme and they can come in! We won'tgive way an inch. If there are comrades here who haven't the courageand the will to dare what we dare, let them leave with the rest ofthe cowards and conciliators! Backed by the workers and soldiers weshall go on."At five minutes past seven came word from the left SocialistRevolutionaries to say that they would remain in the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee."See!" said Lenin. "They are following!"A little later, as we sat at the press table in the big hall, anAnarchist who was writing for the bourgeois papers proposed to methat we go and find out what had become of the presidium. There wasnobody in the _Tsay-ee-kah_ office, nor in the bureau of thePetrograd Soviet. From room to room we wandered, through vastSmolny. Nobody seemed to have the slightest idea where to find thegoverning body of the Congress. As we went my companion describedhis ancient revolutionary activities, his long and pleasant exile inFrance.... As for the Bolsheviki, he confided to me that they werecommon, rude, ignorant persons, without aesthetic sensibilities. Hewas a real specimen of the Russian _intelligentzia_.... So he came atlast to Room 17, office of the Military Revolutionary Committee, andstood there in the midst of all the furious coming and going. Thedoor opened, and out shot a squat, flat-faced man in a uniformwithout insignia, who seemed to be smiling-which smile, after aminute, one saw to be the fixed grin of extreme fatigue. It wasKrylenko.My friend, who was a dapper, civilized-looking young man, gave a cryof pleasure and stepped forward."Nicolai Vasilievitch!" he said, holding out his hand. "Don't youremember me, comrade? We were in prison together."Krylenko made an effort and concentrated his mind and sight. "Whyyes," he answered finally, looking the other up and down with anexpression of great friendliness. "You are S-. _Zdra'stvuitye!_"They kissed. "What are you doing in all this?" He waved his armaround."Oh, I'am just looking on.... You seem very successful.""Yes," replied Krylenko, with a sort of doggedness, "The proletarianRevolution is a great success." He laughed. "Perhaps-perhaps,however, we'll meet in prison again!"When we got out into the corridor again my friend went on with hisexplanations. "You see, I'am a follower of Kropotkin. To us theRevolution is a great failure; it has not aroused the patriotism ofthe masses. Of course that only proves that the people are not readyfor Revolution...."It was just 8.40 when a thundering wave of cheers announced theentrance of the presidium, with Lenin-great Lenin-among them. Ashort, stocky figure, with a big head set down in his shoulders,bald and bulging. Little eyes, a snubbish nose, wide, generousmouth, and heavy chin; clean-shaven now, but already beginning tobristle with the well-known beard of his past and future. Dressed inshabby clothes, his trousers much too long for him. Unimpressive, tobe the idol of a mob, loved and revered as perhaps few leaders inhistory have been. A strange popular leader-a leader purely byvirtue of intellect; colourless, humourless, uncompromising anddetached, without picturesque idiosyncrasies-but with the power ofexplaining profound ideas in simple terms, of analysing a concretesituation. And combined with shrewdness, the greatest intellectualaudacity.Kameniev was reading the report of the actions of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee; abolition of capital punishment in theArmy, restoration of the free right of propaganda, release ofofficers and soldiers arrested for political crimes, orders toarrest Kerensky and confiscation of food supplies in privatestore-houses.... Tremendous applause.Again the representative of the _Bund._ The uncompromising attitudeof the Bolsheviki would mean the crushing of the Revolution;therefore, the _Bund_ delegates must refuse any longer to sit in theCongress. Cries from the audience, "We thought you walked out lastnight! How many times are you going to walk out?"Then the representative of the Mensheviki Internationalists. Shouts,"What! You here still?" The speaker explained that only part of theMensheviki Internationalists left the Congress; the rest were goingto stay-"We consider it dangerous and perhaps even mortal for the Revolutionto transfer the power to the Soviets"-Interruptions-"but we feel itour duty to remain in the Congress and vote against the transferhere!"Other speakers followed, apparently without any order. A delegate ofthe coal-miners of the Don Basin called upon the Congress to takemeasures against Kaledin, who might cut off coal and food from thecapital. Several soldiers just arrived from the Front brought theenthusiastic greetings of their regiments.... Now Lenin, gripping theedge of the reading stand, letting his little winking eyes travelover the crowd as he stood there waiting, apparently oblivious tothe long-rolling ovation, which lasted several minutes. When itfinished, he said simply, "We shall now proceed to construct theSocialist order!" Again that overwhelming human roar."The first thing is the adoption of practical measures to realisepeace.... We shall offer peace to the peoples of all the belligerentcountries upon the basis of the Soviet terms-no annexations, noindemnities, and the right of self-determination of peoples. At thesame time, according to our promise, we shall publish and repudiatethe secret treaties.... The question of War and Peace is so clear thatI think that I may, without preamble, read the project of aProclamation to the Peoples of All the Belligerent Countries...."His great mouth, seeming to smile, opened wide as he spoke; hisvoice was hoarse-not unpleasantly so, but as if it had hardened thatway after years and years of speaking-and went on monotonously, withthe effect of being able to go on forever.... For emphasis he bentforward slightly. No gestures. And before him, a thousand simplefaces looking up in intent adoration.PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS OF ALL THE BELLIGERENTNATIONS.The Workers' and Peasants' Government, created by the revolution ofNovember 6th and 7th and based on the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers'and Peasants' Deputies, proposes to all the belligerent peoples andto their Governments to begin immediately negotiations for a justand democratic peace.The Government means by a just and democratic peace, which isdesired by the immense majority of the workers and the labouringclasses, exhausted and depleted by the war-that peace which theRussian workers and peasants, after having struck down the Tsaristmonarchy, have not ceased to demand categorically-immediate peacewithout annexations (that is to say, without conquest of foreignterritory, without forcible annexation of other nationalities), andwithout indemnities.The Government of Russia Proposes to all the belligerent peoplesimmediately to conclude such a peace, by showing themselves willingto enter upon the decisive steps of negotiations aiming at such apeace, at once, without the slightest delay, before the definitiveratification of all the conditions of such a peace by the authorisedassemblies of the people of all countries and of all nationalities.By annexation or conquest of foreign territory, the Governmentmeans-conformably to the conception of democratic rights in general,and the rights of the working-class in particular-all union to agreat and strong State of a small or weak nationality, without thevoluntary, clear and precise expression of its consent and desire;whatever be the moment when such an annexation by force wasaccomplished, whatever be the degree civilisation of the nationannexed by force or maintained outside the frontiers of anotherState, no matter if that nation be in Europe or in the far countriesacross the sea.If any nation is retained by force within the limits of anotherState; if, in spite of the desire expressed by it, (it matterslittle if that desire be expressed by the press, by popularmeetings, decisions of political parties, or by disorders and riotsagainst national oppression), that nation is not given the right ofdeciding by free vote-without the slightest constraint, after thecomplete departure of the armed forces of the nation which hasannexed it or wishes to annex it or is stronger in general-the formof its national and political organisation, such a union constitutesan annexation-that is to say, conquest and an act of violence.To continue this war in order to permit the strong and rich nationsto divide among themselves the weak and conquered nationalities isconsidered by the Government the greatest possible crime againsthumanity; and the Government solemnly proclaims its decision to signa treaty of peace which will put an end to this war upon the aboveconditions, equally fair for all nationalities without exception.The Government abolishes secret diplomacy, expressing before thewhole country its firm decision to conduct all the negotiations inthe light of day before the people, and will proceed immediately tothe full publication of all secret treaties confirmed or concludedby the Government of land-owners and capitalists, from March untilNovember 7th, 1917. All the clauses of the secret treaties which, asoccur in a majority of cases, have for their object to procureadvantages and privileges for Russian capitalists, to maintain oraugment the annexations of the Russian imperialists, are denouncedby the Government immediately and without discussion.In proposing to all Governments and all peoples to engage in publicnegotiations for peace, the Government declares itself ready tocarry on these negotiations by telegraph, by post, or by pourparlersbetween the representatives of the different countries, or at aconference of these representatives. To facilitate thesepourparlers, the Government appoints its authorised representativesin the neutral countries.The Government proposes to all the governments and to the peoples ofall the belligerent countries to conclude an immediate armistice, atthe same time suggesting that the armistice ought to last threemonths, during which time it is perfectly possible, not only to holdthe necessary pourparlers between the representatives of all thenations and nationalities without exception drawn into the war orforced to take part in it, but also to convoke authorised assembliesof representatives of the people of all countries, for the purposeof the definite acceptance of the conditions of peace.In addressing this offer of peace to the Governments and to thepeoples of all the belligerent countries, the Provisional Workers'and Peasants' Government of Russia addresses equally and inparticular the conscious workers of the three nations most devotedto humanity and the three most important nations among those takingpart in the present war-England, France, and Germany. The workers ofthese countries have rendered the greatest services to the cause ofprogress and of Socialism. The splendid examples of the Chartistmovement in England, the series of revolutions, of world-widehistorical significance, accomplished by the French proletariat-andfinally, in Germany, the historic struggle against the Laws ofException, an example for the workers of the whole world ofprolonged and stubborn action, and the creation of the formidableorganisations of German proletarians-all these models of proletarianheroism, these monuments of history, are for us a sure guaranteethat the workers of these countries will understand the duty imposedupon them to liberate humanity from the horrors and consequences ofwar; and that these workers, by decisive, energetic and continuedaction, will help us to bring to a successful conclusion the causeof peace-and at the same time, the cause of the liberation of theexploited working masses from all slavery and all exploitation.When the grave thunder of applause had died away, Lenin spoke again:"We propose to the Congress to ratify this declaration. We addressourselves to the Governments as well as to the peoples, for adeclaration which would be addressed only to the peoples of thebelligerent countries might delay the conclusion of peace. Theconditions of peace, drawn up during the armistice, will be ratifiedby the Constituent Assembly. In fixing the duration of the armisticeat three months, we desire to give to the peoples as long a rest aspossible after this bloody extermination, and ample time for them toelect their representatives. This proposal of peace will meet withresistance on the part of the imperialist governments-we don't foolourselves on that score. But we hope that revolution will soon breakout in all the belligerent countries; that is why we addressourselves especially to the workers of France, England and Germany...."The revolution of November 6th and 7th," he ended, "has opened theera of the Social Revolution.... The labour movement, in the name ofpeace and Socialism, shall win, and fulfil its destiny....There was something quiet and powerful in all this, which stirredthe souls of men. It was understandable why people believed whenLenin spoke...."By crowd vote it was quickly decided that only representatives ofpolitical factions should be allowed to speak on the motion and thatspeakers should be limited to fifteen minutes.First Karelin for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. "Our factionhad no opportunity to propose amendments to the text of theproclamation; it is a private document of the Bolsheviki. But wewill vote for it because we agree with its spirit...."For the Social Democrats Internationalists Kramarov, long,stoop-shouldered and near-sighted-destined to achieve some notorietyas the Clown of the Opposition. Only a Government composed of allthe Socialist parties, he said, could possess the authority to takesuch important action. If a Socialist coalition were formed, hisfaction would support the entire programme; if not, only part of it.As for the proclamation, the Internationalists were in thoroughaccord with its main points....Then one after another, amid rising enthusiasm; Ukrainean SocialDemocracy, support; Lithuanian Social Democracy, support; PopulistSocialists, support; Polish Social Democracy, support; PolishSocialists support-but would prefer a Socialist coalition; LettishSocial Democracy, support.... Something was kindled in these men. Onespoke of the "coming World-Revolution, of which we are theadvance-guard"; another of "the new age of brotherhood, when all thepeoples will become one great family...." An individual member claimedthe floor. "There is contradiction here," he said. "First you offerpeace without annexations and indemnities, and then you say you willconsider all peace offers. To consider means to accept...."Lenin was on his feet. "We want a just peace, but we are not afraidof a revolutionary war.... Probably the imperialist Governments willnot answer our appeal-but we shall not issue an ultimatum to whichit will be easy to say no.... If the German proletariat realises thatwe are ready to consider all offers of peace, that will perhaps bethe last drop which overflows the bowl-revolution will break out inGermany...."We consent to examine all conditions of peace, but that doesn'tmean that we shall accept them.... For some of our terms we shallfight to the end-but possibly for others will find it impossible tocontinue the war.... Above all, we want to finish the war...."It was exactly 10:35 when Kameniev asked all in favour of theproclamation to hold up their cards. One delegate dared to raise hishand against, but the sudden sharp outburst around him brought itswiftly down.... Unanimous.Suddenly, by common impulse, we found ourselves on our feet,mumbling together into the smooth lifting unison of the_Internationale._ A grizzled old soldier was sobbing like a child.Alexandra Kollontai rapidly winked the tears back. The immense soundrolled through the hall, burst windows and doors and seared into thequiet sky. "The war is ended! The war is ended!" said a youngworkman near me, his face shining. And when it was over, as we stoodthere in a kind of awkward hush, some one in the back of the room     ck of the room     |          |shouted, "Comrades! Let us remember those who have died forliberty!" So we began to sing the Funeral March, that slow,melancholy and yet triumphant chant, so Russian and so moving. The_Internationale_ is an alien air, after all. The Funeral Marchseemed the very soul of those dark masses whose delegates sat inthis hall, building from their obscure visions a new Russia-andperhaps more.You fell in the fatal fightFor the liberty of the people, for the honour of the people....You gave up your lives and everything dear to you,You suffered in horrible prisons,You went to exile in chains....Without a word you carried your chains because you could not ignoreyour suffering brothers,Because you believed that justice is stronger than the sword....The time will come when your surrendered life will countThat time is near; when tyranny falls the people will rise, greatand free!Farewell, brothers, you chose a noble path,You are followed by the new and fresh army ready to die and tosuffer....Farewell, brothers, you chose a noble path,At your grave we swear to fight, to work for freedom and thepeople's happiness....For this did they lie there, the martyrs of March, in their coldBrotherhood Grave on Mars Field; for this thousands and tens ofthousands had died in the prisons, in exile, in Siberian mines. Ithad not come as they expected it would come, nor as the_intelligentzia_ desired it; but it had come-rough, strong,impatient of formulas, contemptuous of sentimentalism; real....Lenin was reading the Decree on Land:(1.) All private ownership of land is abolished immediately withoutcompensation.(2.) All land_owners' estates, and all lands belonging to the Crown,to monasteries, church lands with all their live stock andinventoried property, buildings and all appurtenances, aretransferred to the disposition of the township Land Committees andthe district Soviets of Peasants' Deputies until the ConstituentAssembly meets.(3.) Any damage whatever done to the confiscated property which fromnow on belongs to the whole People, is regarded as a serious crime,punishable by the revolutionary tribunals. The district Soviets ofPeasants' Deputies shall take all necessary measures for theobservance of the strictest order during the taking over of theland-owners' estates, for the determination of the dimensions of theplots of land and which of them are subject to confiscation, for thedrawing up of an inventory of the entire confiscated property, andfor the strictest revolutionary protection of all the farmingproperty on the land, with all buildings, implements, cattle,supplies of products, etc., passing into the hands of the People.(4.) For guidance during the realisation of the great land reformsuntil their final resolution by the Constituent Assembly, shallserve the following peasant _nakaz_ (See App. V, Sect. 3)(instructions), drawn up on the basis of 242 local peasant _nakazi_by the editorial board of the "_Izviestia_ of the All-Russian Sovietof Peasants' Deputies," and published in No.88 of said _"Izviestia"_(Petrograd, No.88, August 19th, 1917).The lands of peasants and of Cossacks serving in the Army shall notbe confiscated."This is not," explained Lenin, "the project of former MinisterTchernov, who spoke of 'erecting a frame-work' and tried to realisereforms from above. From below, on the spot, will be decided thequestions of division of the land. The amount of land received byeach peasant will vary according to the locality...."Under the Provisional Government, the _pomieshtchiki_ flatlyrefused to obey the orders of the Land Committees-those LandCommittees projected by Lvov, brought into existence by Shingariov,and administered by Kerensky!"Before the debates could begin a man forced his way violentlythrough the crowd in the aisle and climbed upon the platform. It wasPianikh, member of the Executive Committee of the Peasants' Soviets,and he was mad clean through."The Executive Committee of the All-Russian Soviets of Peasants'Deputies protests against the arrest of our comrades, the MinistersSalazkin and Mazlov!" he flung harshly in the faces of the crowd,"We demand their instant release! They are now in Peter-Paulfortress. We must have immediate action! There is not a moment tolose!"Another followed him, a soldier with disordered beard and flamingeyes. "You sit here and talk about giving the land to the peasants,and you commit an act of tyrants and usurpers against the peasants'chosen representatives! I tell you-" he raised his fist, "If onehair of their heads is harmed, you'll have a revolt on your hands!"The crowd stirred confusedly.Then up rose Trotzky, calm and venomous, conscious of power, greetedwith a roar. "Yesterday the Military Revolutionary Committee decidedto release the Socialist Revolutionary and Menshevik Ministers,Mazlov, Salazkin, Gvozdov and Maliantovitch-on principle. That theyare still in Peter-Paul is only because we have had so much to do....They will, however, be detained at their homes under arrest until wehave investigated their complicity in the treacherous acts ofKerensky during the Kornilov affair!""Never," shouted Pianikh, "in any revolution have such things beenseen as go on here!""You are mistaken," responded Trotzky. "Such things have been seeneven in this revolution. Hundreds of our comrades were arrested inthe July days.... When Comrade Kollontai was released from prison bythe doctor's orders, Avksentiev placed at her door two former agentsof the Tsar's secret police!" The peasants withdrew, muttering,followed by ironical hoots.The representative of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries spoke onthe Land Decree. While agreeing in principle, his faction could notvote on the question until after discussion. The Peasants' Sovietsshould be consulted....The Mensheviki Internationalists, too, insisted on a party caucus.Then the leader of the Maximalists, the Anarchist wing of thepeasants: "We must do honour to a political party which puts such anact into effect the first day, without jawing about it!"A typical peasant was in the tribune, long hair, boots andsheep-skin coat, bowing to all corners of the hall. "I wish youwell, comrades and citizens," he said. "There are some Cadetswalking around outside. You arrested our Socialist peasants-why notarrest them?"This was the signal for a debate of excited peasants. It wasprecisely like the debate of soldiers of the night before. Here werethe real proletarians of the land...."Those members of our Executive Committee, Avksentiev and the rest,whom we thought were the peasants' protectors-they are only Cadetstoo! Arrest them! Arrest them!"Another, "Who are these Pianikhs, these Avksentievs? They are notpeasants at all! They only wag their tails!"How the crowd rose to them, recognising brothers!The Left Socialist Revolutionaries proposed a half-hourintermission. As the delegates streamed out, Lenin stood up in hisplace."We must not lose time, comrades! News all-important to Russia mustbe on the press to-morrow morning. No delay!"And above the hot discussion, argument, shuffling of feet could beheard the voice of an emissary of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, crying, "Fifteen agitators wanted in room 17 at once! Togo to the Front!"hellip;It was almost two hours and a half later that the delegates camestraggling back, the presidium mounted the platform, and the sessionrecommenced by the reading of telegrams from regiment afterregiment, announcing their adhesion to the Military RevolutionaryCommittee.In leisurely manner the meeting gathered momentum. A delegate fromthe Russian troops on the Macedonian front spoke bitterly of theirsituation. "We suffer there more from the friendship of our 'Allies'than from the enemy," he said. Representatives of the Tenth andTwelfth Armies, just arrived in hot haste, reported, "We support youwith all our strength!" A peasant-soldier protested against therelease of "the traitor Socialists, Mazlov and Salazkin"; as for theExecutive Committee of the Peasants' Soviets, it should be arrested_en masse!_Here was real revolutionary talk.... A deputy from theRussian Army in Persia declared he was instructed to demand allpower to the Soviets.... A Ukrainean officer, speaking in his nativetongue: "There is no nationalism in this crisis.... _Da zdravstvuyet_the proletarian dictatorship of all lands!" Such a deluge of highand hot thoughts that surely Russia would never again be dumb!Kameniev remarked that the anti-Bolshevik forces were trying to stirup disorders everywhere, and read an appeal of the Congress to allthe Soviets of Russia:The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies, including some Peasants' Deputies, calls upon the localSoviets to take immediate energetic measures to oppose allcounter-revolutionary anti-Jewish action and all _pogroms,_ whateverthey may be. The honour of the Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers'Revolution demands that no _pogrom_ be tolerated.The Red Guard of Petrograd, the revolutionary garrison and thesailors have maintained complete order in the capital.Workers, soldiers and peasants, you should follow everywhere theexample of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd.Comrade soldiers and Cossacks, on us falls the duty of assuring realrevolutionary order.All revolutionary Russia and the entire world have their eyes on us....At two o'clock the Land Decree was put to vote, with only oneagainst and the peasant delegates wild with joy.... So plunged theBolsheviki ahead, irresistible, over-riding hesitation andopposition-the only people in Russia who had a definite programme ofaction while the others talked for eight long months.Now arose a soldier, gaunt, ragged and eloquent, to protest againstthe clause of the _nakaz_ tending to deprive military deserters froma share in village land allotments. Bawled at and hissed at first,his simple, moving speech finally made silence. "Forced against hiswill into the butchery of the trenches," he cried, "which youyourselves, in the Peace decree, have voted senseless as well ashorrible, he greeted the Revolution with hope of peace and freedom.Peace? The Government of Kerensky forced him again to go forwardinto Galicia to slaughter and be slaughtered; to his pleas forpeace, Terestchenko simply laughed.... Freedom? Under Kerensky hefound his Committees suppressed, his newspapers cut off, his partyspeakers put in prison.... At home in his village, the landlords weredefying his Land Committees, jailing his comrades.... In Petrograd thebourgeoisie, in alliance with the Germans, were sabotaging the foodand ammunition for the Army.... He was without boots, or clothes.... Whoforced him to desert? The Government of Kerensky, which you haveoverthrown!" At the end there was applause.But another soldier hotly denounced it: "The Government of Kerenskyis not a screen behind which can be hidden dirty work likedesertion! Deserters are scoundrels, who run away home and leavetheir comrades to die in the trenches alone! Every deserter is atraitor, and should be punished...." Uproar, shouts of _"Do volno!Teesche!"_ Kameniev hastily proposed to leave the matter to theGovernment for decision. (See App. V, Sect. 4)At 2.30 A. M. fell a tense hush. Kameniev was reading the decree ofthe Constitution of Power:Until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly, a provisionalWorkers' and Peasants' Government is formed, which shall be namedthe Council of People's Commissars. (See App. V, Sect. 5)The administration of the different branches of state activity shallbe intrusted to commissions, whose composition shall be regulated toensure the carrying out of the programme of the Congress, in closeunion with the mass-organisations of working-men, working-women,sailors, soldiers, peasants and clerical employees. The governmentalpower is vested in a _collegium_ made up of the chairmen of thesecommissions, that is to say, the Council of People's Commissars.Control over the activities of the People's Commissars, and theright to replace them, shall belong to the All-Russian Congress ofSoviets of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies, and itsCentral Executive Committee.Still silence; as he read the list of Commissars, bursts of applauseafter each name, Lenin's and Trotzky's especially._President of the Council:_ Vladimir Ulianov _(Lenin)__Interior:_ A. E. Rykov_Agriculture:_ V. P. Miliutin_Labour:_ A. G. Shliapnikov_Military and Naval Affairs_-a committee composed of V. A._Avseenko (Antonov),_ N. V. Krylenko, and F. M. Dybenko._Commerce and Industry:_ V. P. Nogin_Popular Education:_ A. V. Lunatcharsky_Finance:_ E. E. Skvortsov _(Stepanov)__Foreign Affairs:_ L. D. Bronstein _(Trotzky)__Justice:_ G. E. Oppokov _(Lomov)__Supplies:_ E. A. Teodorovitch_Post and Telegraph:_ N. P. Avilov _(Gliebov)__Chairman for Nationalities:_ I. V. Djougashvili _(Stalin)__Railroads:_ To be filled later.There were bayonets at the edges of the room, bayonets pricking upamong the delegates; the Military Revolutionary Committee was armingeverybody, Bolshevism was arming for the decisive battle withKerensky, the sound of whose trumpets came up the south-west wind....In the meanwhile nobody went home; on the contrary hundreds ofnewcomers filtered in, filling the great room solid with stern-facedsoldiers and workmen who stood for hours and hours, indefatigablyintent. The air was thick with cigarette smoke, and human breathing,and the smell of coarse clothes and sweat.Avilov of the staff of _Novaya Zhizn_ was speaking in the name ofthe Social Democrat Internationalists and the remnant of theMensheviki Internationalists; Avilov, with his young, intelligentface, looking out of place in his smart frock-coat."We must ask ourselves where we are going.... The ease with which theCoalition Government was upset cannot be explained by the strengthof the left wing of the democracy, but only by the incapacity of theGovernment to give the people peace and bread. And the left wingcannot maintain itself in power unless it can solve these questions...."Can it give bread to the people? Grain is scarce. The majority ofthe peasants will not be with you, for you cannot give them themachinery they need. Fuel and other primary necessities are almostimpossible to procure...."As for peace, that will be even more difficult. The allies refusedto talk with Skobeliev. They will never accept the proposition of apeace conference from _you._ You will not be recognised either inLondon and Paris, or in Berlin...."You cannot count on the effective help of the proletariat of theAllied countries, because in most countries it is very far from therevolutionary struggle; remember, the Allied democracy was unableeven to convoke the Stockholm Conference. Concerning the GermanSocial Democrats, I have just talked with Comrade Goldenberg, one ofour delegates to Stockholm; he was told by the representatives ofthe Extreme Left that revolution in Germany was impossible duringthe war...." Here interruptions began to come thick and fast, butAvilov kept on."The isolation of Russia will fatally result either in the defeat ofthe Russian Army by the Germans, and the patching up of a peacebetween the Austro-German coalition and the Franco-British coalition_at the expense of Russia_-or in a separate peace with Germany."I have just learned that the Allied ambassadors are preparing toleave, and that Committees for Salvation of Country and Revolutionare forming in all the cities of Russia...."No one party can conquer these enormous difficulties. The majorityof the people, supporting a government of Socialist coalition, canalone accomplish the Revolution...."He then read the resolution of the two factions:Recognising that for the salvation of the conquests of theRevolution it is indispensable immediately to constitute agovernment based on the revolutionary democracy organised in theSoviets of Workers,' Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, recognisingmoreover that the task of this government is the quickest possibleattainment of peace, the transfer of the land into the hands of theagrarian committees, the organisation of control over industrialproduction, and the convocation of the Constituent Assembly on thedate decided, the Congress appoints an executive committee toconstitute such a government after an agreement with the groups ofthe democracy which are taking part in the Congress.In spite of the revolutionary exaltation of the triumphant crowd,Avilov's cool tolerant reasoning had shaken them. Toward the end,the cries and hisses died away, and when he finished there was evensome clapping.Karelin followed him-also young, fearless, whose sincerity no onedoubted-for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, the party of MariaSpiridonova, the party which almost alone followed the Bolsheviki,and which represented the revolutionary peasants."Our party has refused to enter the Council of People's Commissarsbecause we do not wish forever to separate ourselves from the partof the revolutionary army which left the Congress, a separationwhich would make it impossible for us to serve as intermediariesbetween the Bolsheviki and the other groups of the democracy.... Andthat is our principal duty at this moment. We cannot sustain anygovernment except a government of Socialist coalition...."We protest, moreover, against the tyrannical conduct of theBolsheviki. Our Commissars have been driven from their posts. Ouronly organ, _Znamia Truda_ (Banner of Labour), was forbidden toappear yesterday...."The Central Duma is forming a powerful Committee for Salvation ofCountry and Revolution, to fight you. Already you are isolated, andyour Government is without the support of a single other democraticgroup....And now Trotzky stood upon the raised tribune, confident anddominating, with that sarcastic expression about his mouth which wasalmost a sneer. He spoke, in a ringing voice, and the great crowdrose to him."These considerations on the dangers of isolation of our party arenot new. On the eve of insurrection our fatal defeat was alsopredicted. Everybody was against us; only a faction of the SocialistRevolutionaries of the left was with us in the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee. How is it that we were able to overturn theGovernment almost without bloodshed?.... That fact is the moststriking proof that we _were not isolated._ In reality theProvisional Government was isolated; the democratic parties whichmarch against us were isolated, are isolated, and forever cut offfrom the proletariat!"They speak of the necessity for a coalition. There is only onecoalition possible-the coalition of the workers, soldiers andpoorest peasants; and it is our party's honour to have realised thatcoalition.... What sort of coalition did Avilov mean? A coalition withthose who supported the Government of Treason to the People?Coalition doesn't always add to strength. For example, could we haveorganised the insurrection with Dan and Avksentiev in our ranks?"Roars of laughter."Avksentiev gave little bread. Will a coalition with the _oborontsi_furnish more? Between the peasants and Avksentiev, who ordered thearrest of the Land Committees, we choose the peasants! OurRevolution will remain the classic revolution of history...."They accuse us of repelling an agreement with the other democraticparties. But is it we who are to blame? Or must we, as Karelin putit, blame it on a 'misunderstanding'? No, comrades. When a party infull tide of revolution, still wreathed in powder-smoke, comes tosay, 'Here is the Power-take it!'-and when those to whom it isoffered go over to the enemy, that is not a misunderstanding.... thatis a declaration of pitiless war. And it isn't we who have declaredwar...."Avilov menaces us with failure of our peace efforts-if we remain'isolated.' I repeat, I don't see how a coalition with Skobeliev, oreven Terestchenko, can help us to get peace! Avilov tries tofrighten us by the threat of a peace at our expense. And I answerthat in any case, if Europe continues to be ruled by the imperialistbourgeoisie, revolutionary Russia will inevitably be lost...."There are only two alternatives; either the Russian Revolution willcreate a revolutionary movement in Europe, or the European powerswill destroy the Russian Revolution!"They greeted him with an immense crusading acclaim, kindling to thedaring of it, with the thought of championing mankind. And from thatmoment there was something conscious and decided about theinsurrectionary masses, in all their actions, which never left them.But on the other side, too, battle was taking form. Kamenievrecognised a delegate from the Union of Railway Workers, ahardfaced, stocky man with an attitude of implacable hostility. Hethrew a bombshell."In the name of the strongest organisation in Russia I demand theright to speak, and I say to you: the _Vikzhel_charges me to makeknown the decision of the Union concerning the constitution ofPower. The Central Committee refuses absolutely to support theBolsheviki if they persist in isolating themselves from the wholedemocracy of Russia!" Immense tumult all over the hall."In 1905, and in the Kornilov days, the Railway Workers were thebest defenders of the Revolution. But you did not invite us to yourCongress-" Cries, "It was the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ which did not inviteyou!" The orator paid no attention. "We do not recognise thelegality of this Congress; since the departure of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries there is not a legal quorum.... The Unionsupports the old _Tsay-ee-Kah,_ and declares that the Congress hasno right to elect a new Committee...."The Power should be a Socialist and revolutionary Power,responsible before the authorised organs of the entire revolutionarydemocracy. Until the constitution of such a power, the Union ofRailway Workers, which refuses to transport counter-revolutionarytroops to Petrograd, at the same time forbids the execution of anyorder whatever without the consent of the _Vikzhel._ The _Vikzhel_also takes into its hands the entire administration of the railroadsof Russia."At the end he could hardly be heard for the furious storm of abusewhich beat upon him. But it was a heavy blow-that could be seen inthe concern on the faces of the presidium. Kameniev, however, merelyanswered that there could be no doubt of the legality of theCongress, as even the quorum established by the old _Tsay-ee-Kah_was exceeded-in spite of the secession of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolution arises....Then came the vote on the Constitution of Power, which carried theCouncil of People's Commissars into office by an enormous majority....The election of the new _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the new parliament of theRussian Republic, took barely fifteen minutes. Trotzky announced itscomposition: 100 members, of which 70 Bolsheviki.... As for thepeasants, and the seceding factions, places were to be reserved forthem. "We welcome into the Government all parties and groups whichwill adopt our programme," ended Trotzky.And thereupon the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets wasdissolved, so that the members might hurry to their homes in thefour corners of Russia and tell of the great happenings....It was almost seven when we woke the sleeping conductors andmotor-men of the street-cars which the Street-Railway Workers' Unionalways kept waiting at Smolny to take the Soviet delegates to theirhomes. In the crowded car there was less happy hilarity than thenight before, I thought. Many looked anxious; perhaps they weresaying to themselves, "Now we are masters, how can we do our will?"At our apartment-house we were held up in the dark by an armedpatrol of citizens and carefully examined. The Duma's proclamationwas doing its work....The landlady heard us come in, and stumbled out in a pink silkwrapper.The House Committee has again asked that you take your turn onguard-duty with the rest of the men," she said."What's the reason for this guard-duty?""To protect the house and the women and children.""Who from?""Robbers and murderers.""But suppose there came a Commissar from the Military RevolutionaryCommittee to search for arms?""Oh, that's what they'll _say_ they are.... And besides, what's thedifference?"I solemnly affirmed that the Consul had forbidden all Americancitizens to carry arms-especially in the neighbourhood of theRussian _intelligentzia_....                              Chapter VI                      The Committee for SalvationFRIDAY, November 9th....Novotcherkask, November 8th.In view of the revolt of the Bolsheviki, and their attempt to deposethe Provisional Government and to seize the power in Petrograd... theCossack Government declares that it considers these acts criminaland absolutely inadmissible. In consequence, the Cossacks will lendall their support to the Provisional Government, which is agovernment of coalition. Because of these circumstances, and untilthe return of the Provisional Government to power, and therestoration of order in Russia, I take upon myself, beginningNovember 7th, all the power in that which concerns the region of theDon.Signed: ATAMAN KALEDIN_President of the Government of the Cossack Troops.__Prikaz_ of the Minister-President Kerensky, dated at Gatchina:I, Minister-President of the Provisional Government, and SupremeCommander of all the armed forces of the Russian Republic, declarethat I am at the head of regiments from the Front who have remainedfaithful to the fatherland.I order all the troops of the Military District of Petrograd, whothrough mistake or folly have answered the appeal of the traitors tothe country and the Revolution, to return to their duty withoutdelay.This order shall be read in all regiments, battalions and squadrons.Signed: _Minister-President of the Provisional__Government and Supreme Commander_A. F. KERENSKY.Telegram from Kerensky to the General in Command of the NorthernFront:The town of Gatchina has been taken by the loyal regiments withoutbloodshed. Detachments of Cronstadt sailors, and of the Semionovskyand Ismailovsky regiments, gave up their arms without resistance andjoined the Government troops.I order all the designated units to advance as quickly as possible.The Military Revolutionary Committee has ordered its troops toretreat....Gatchina, about thirty kilometers south-west, had fallen during thenight. Detachments of the two regiments mentioned-not thesailors-while wandering captainless in the neighbourhood, had indeedbeen surrounded by Cossacks and given up their arms; but it was nottrue that they had joined the Government troops. At this very momentcrowds of them, bewildered and ashamed, were up at Smolny trying toexplain. They did not think the Cossacks were so near.... They hadtried to argue with the Cossacks....Apparently the greatest confusion prevailed along the revolutionaryfront. The garrisons of all the little towns southward had splithopelessly, bitterly into two factions-or three: the high commandbeing on the side of Kerensky, in default of anything stronger, themajority of the rank and file with the Soviets, and the restunhappily wavering.Hastily the Military Revolutionary Committee appointed to commandthe defence of Petrograd an ambitious regular Army Captain,Muraviov, the same Muraviov who had organised the Death Battalionsduring the summer, and had once been heard to advise the Governmentthat "it was too lenient with the Bolsheviki; they must be wipedout." A man of military mind, who admired power and audacity,perhaps sincerely....Beside my door when I came down in the morning were posted two neworders of the Military Revolutionary Committee, directing that allshops and stores should open as usual, and that all empty rooms andapartments should be put at the disposal of the Committee....For thirty-six hours now the Bolsheviki had been cut off fromprovincial Russia and the outside world. The railway men andtelegraphers refused to transmit their despatches, the postmen wouldnot handle their mail. Only the Government wireless at TsarskoyeSelo launched half-hourly bulletins and manifestoes to the fourcorners of heaven; the Commissars of Smolny raced the Commissars ofthe City Duma on speeding trains half across the earth; and twoaeroplanes, laden with propaganda, fled high up toward the Front....But the eddies of insurrection were spreading through Russia with aswiftness surpassing any human agency. Helsingfors Soviet passedresolutions of support; Kiev Bolsheviki captured the arsenal and thetelegraph station, only to be driven out by delegates to theCongress of Cossacks, which happened to be meeting there; in Kazan,a Military Revolutionary Committee arrested the local garrison staffand the Commissar of the Provisional Government; from farKrasnoyarsk, in Siberia, came news that the Soviets were in controlof the Municipal institutions; at Moscow, where the situation wasaggravated by a great strike of leather-workers on one side, and athreat of general lock-out on the other, the Soviets had votedoverwhelmingly to support the action of the Bolsheviki inPetrograd.... Already a Military Revolutionary Committee wasfunctioning.Everywhere the same thing happened. The common soldiers and theindustrial workers supported the Soviets by a vast majority; theofficers, _yunkers_ and middle class generally were on the side ofthe Government-as were the bourgeois Cadets and the "moderate"Socialist parties. In all these towns sprang up Committees forSalvation of Country and Revolution, arming for civil war....Vast Russia was in a state of solution. As long ago as 1905 theprocess had begun; the March Revolution had merely hastened it, andgiving birth to a sort of forecast of the new order, had ended bymerely perpetuating the hollow structure of the old regime. Now,however, the Bolsheviki, in one night, had dissipated it, as oneblows away smoke. Old Russia was no more; human society flowedmolten in primal heat, and from the tossing sea of flame wasemerging the class struggle, stark and pitiless-and the fragile,slowly-cooling crust of new planets....In Petrograd sixteen Ministries were on strike, led by theMinistries of Labour and of Supplies-the only two created by theall-Socialist Government of August.If ever men stood alone the "handful of Bolsheviki" apparently stoodalone that grey chill morning, with all storms towering over them.(See App. VI, Sect. 1) Back against the wall, the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee struck-for its life. _"De l'audace, encorede l'audace, et toujours de l'audace_.... At five in the morning theRed Guards entered the printing office of the City Government,confiscated thousands of copies of the Appeal-Protest of the Duma,and suppressed the official Municipal organ-the _Viestnik GorodskovoSamoupravleniya_ (Bulletin of the Municipal Self-Government). Allthe bourgeois newspapers were torn from the presses, even the _GolosSoldata,_ journal of the old _Tsay-ee-kah_-which, however, changingits name to _Soldatski Golos,_ appeared in an edition of a hundredthousand copies, bellowing rage and defiance:The men who began their stroke of treachery in the night, who havesuppressed the newspapers, will not keep the country in ignorancelong. The country will know the truth! It will appreciate you,Messrs. the Bolsheviki! We shall see!...As we came down the Nevsky a little after midday the whole streetbefore the Duma building was crowded with people. Here and therestood Red Guards and sailors, with bayonetted rifles, each onesurrounded by about a hundred men and women-clerks, students,shopkeepers, _tchinovniki_-shaking their fists and bawling insultsand menaces. On the steps stood boy-scouts and officers,distributing copies of the _Soldatski Golos._ A workman with a redband around his arm and a revolver in his hand stood trembling withrage and nervousness in the middle of a hostile throng at the footof the stairs, demanding the surrender of the papers.... Nothing likethis, I imagine, ever occurred in history. On one side a handful ofworkmen and common soldiers, with arms in their hands, representinga victorious insurrection-and perfectly miserable; on the other afrantic mob made up of the kind of people that crowd the sidewalksof Fifth Avenue at noon-time, sneering, abusing, shouting,"Traitors! Provocators! _Opritchniki!_ [*]"[* Savage body-guards if Ian the Terrible, 17th century]The doors were guarded by students and officers with white arm-bandslettered in red, "Militia of the Committee of Public Safety," andhalf a dozen boy-scouts came and went. Upstairs the place was allcommotion. Captain Gomberg was coming down the stairs. "They'regoing to dissolve the Duma," he said. "The Bolshevik Commissar iswith the Mayor now." As we reached the top Riazanov came hurryingout. He had been to demand that the Duma recognise the Council ofpeoples' Commissars, and the Mayor had given him a flat refusal.In the offices a great babbling crowd, hurrying, shouting,gesticulating-Government officials, intellectuals, journalists,foreign correspondents, French and British officers.... "The CityEngineer pointed to them triumphantly. "The Embassies recognise theDuma as the only power now," he explained. "For these Bolshevikmurderers and robbers it is only a question of hours. All Russia israllying to us....In the Alexander Hall a monster meeting of the Committee forSalvation. Fillipovsky in the chair and Skobeliev again in thetribune, reporting, to immense applause, new adhesions to theCommittee; Executive Committee of Peasants' Soviets, old_Tsay-ee-kah,_ Central Army Committee, _Tsentroflot,_ Menshevik,Socialist Revolutionary and Front group delegates from the Congressof Soviets, Central Committees of the Menshevik, SocialistRevolutionary, Populist Socialist parties. "Yedinstvo" group,Peasants' Union, Cooperatives, Zemstvos, Municipalities, Post andTelegraph Unions, _Vikzhel,_ Council of the Russian Republic, Unionof Unions,  [*] Merchants' and Manufacturers' Association....[* See Notes and Explanations.]".... The power of the Soviets is not democratic power, but adictatorship-and not the dictatorship of the proletariat, but_against_ the proletariat. All those who have felt or know how tofeel revolutionary enthusiasm must join now for the defence of theRevolution...."The problem of the day is not only to render harmless irresponsibledemagogues, but to fight against the counter-revolution.... If rumoursare true that certain generals in the provinces are attempting toprofit by events in order to march on Petrograd with other designs,it is only one more proof that we must establish a solid base ofdemocratic government. Otherwise, troubles with the Right willfollow troubles from the Left...."The garrison of Petrograd cannot remain indifferent when citizensbuying the _Golos Soldata_ and newsboys selling the _RabotchayaGazeta_ are arrested in the streets...."The hour of resolutions has passed.... Let those who have no longerfaith in the Revolution retire.... To establish a united power, wemust again restore the prestige of the Revolution...."Let us swear that either the Revolution shall be saved-or we shallperish!"The hall rose, cheering, with kindling eyes. There was not a singleproletarian anywhere in sight....Then Weinstein:"We must remain calm, and not act until public opinion is firmlygrouped in support of the Committee for Salvation-then we can passfrom the defensive to action!"The _Vikzhel_ representative announced that his organisation wastaking the initiative in forming the new Government, and itsdelegates were now discussing the matter with Smolny.... Followed ahot discussion: were the Bolsheviki to be admitted to the newGovernment? Martov pleaded for their admission; after all, he said,they represented an important political party. Opinions were verymuch divided upon this, the right wing Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries, as well as the Populist Socialists, theCooperatives and the bourgeois elements being bitterly against...."They have betrayed Russia," one speaker said. "They have startedcivil war and opened the front to the Germans. The Bolsheviki mustbe mercilessly crushed...."Skobeliev was in favor of excluding both the Bolsheviki and theCadets.We got into conversation with a young Socialist Revolutionary, whohad walked out of the Democratic Conference to gether with theBolsheviki, that night when Tseretelli and the "compromisers" forcedCoalition upon the democracy of Russia."You here?" I asked him.His eyes flashed fire. "Yes!" he cried. "I left the Congress with myparty Wednesday night. I have not risked my life for twenty yearsand more to submit now to the tyranny of the Dark People. Theirmethods are intolerable. But they have not counted on the peasants....When the peasants begin to act, then it is a question of minutesbefore they are done for.""But the peasants-will they act? Doesn't the Land decree settle thepeasants? What more do they want?""Ah, the Land decree!" he said furiously. "Yes, do you know whatthat Land decree is? It is _our_ decree-it is the SocialistRevolutionary programme, intact! My party framed that policy, afterthe most careful compilation of the wishes of the peasantsthemselves. It is an outrage....""But if it is your own policy, why do you object? If it is thepeasants' wishes, why will they oppose it?""You don't understand! Don't you see that the peasants willimmediately realise that it is all a trick-that these usurpers havestolen the Socialist Revolutionary programme?"I asked if it were true that Kaledin was marching north.He nodded, and rubbed his hands with a sort of bitter satisfaction."Yes. Now you see what these Bolsheviki have done. They have raisedthe counter-revolution against us. The Revolution is lost. TheRevolution is lost.""But won't you defend the Revolution?""Of course we will defend it-to the last drop of our blood. But wewon't cooperate with the Bolsheviki in any way....""But if Kaledin comes to Petrograd, and the Bolsheviki defend thecity. Won't you join with them?""Of course not. We will defend the city also, but we won't supportthe Bolsheviki. Kaledin is the enemy of the Revolution, but theBolsheviki are equally enemies of the Revolution.""Which do you prefer-Kaledin or the Bolsheviki?""It is not a question to be discussed!" he burst out impatiently. "Itell you, the Revolution is lost. And it is the Bolsheviki who areto blame. But listen-why should we talk of such things? Kerensky iscomming.... Day after tomorrow we shall pass to the offensive....Already Smolny has sent delegates inviting us to form a newGovernment. But we have them now-they are absolutely impotent.... Weshall not cooperate...."Outside there was a shot. We ran to the windows. A Red Guard,finally exasperated by the taunts of the crowd, had shot into it,wounding a young girl in the arm. We could see her being lifted intoa cab, surrounded by an excited throng, the clamour of whose voicesfloated up to us. As we looked, suddenly an armoured automobileappeared around the corner of the Mikhailovsky, its guns sluing thisway and that. Immediately the crowd began to run, as Petrogradcrowds do, falling down and lying still in the street, piled in thegutters, heaped up behind telephone-poles. The car lumbered up tothe steps of the Duma and a man stuck his head out of the turret,demanding the surrender of the _Soldatski Golos._ The boy-scoutsjeered and scuttled into the building. After a moment the automobilewheeled undecidedly around and went off up the Nevsky, while somehundreds of men and women picked themselves up and began to dusttheir clothes....Inside was a prodigious running-about of people with armfuls of_Soldatski Golos,_ looking for places to hide them....A journalist came running into the room, waving a paper."Here's a proclamation from Krasnov!" he cried. Everybody crowdedaround. "Get it printed-get it printed quick, and around to thebarracks!"By the order of the Supreme Commander I am appointed commandant ofthe troops concentrated under Petrograd.Citizens, soldiers, valorous Cossacks of the Don, of the Kuban, ofthe Transbaikal, of the Amur, of the Yenissei, to all you who haveremained faithful to your oath I appeal; to you who have sworn toguard inviolable your oath of Cossack-I call upon you to savePetrograd from anarchy, from famine, from tyranny, and to saveRussia from the indelible shame to which a handful of ignorant men,bought by the gold of Wilhelm, are trying to submit her.The Provisional Government, to which you swore fidelity in the greatdays of March, is not overthrown, but by violence expelled from theedifice in which it held its meetings. However the Government, withthe help of the Front armies, faithful to their duty, with the helpof the Council of Cossacks, which has united under its command allthe Cossacks and which, strong with the morale which reigns in itsranks, and acting in accordance with the will of the Russian people,has sworn to serve the country as its ancestors served it in theTroublous Times of 1612, when the Cossacks of the Don deliveredMoscow, menaced by the Swedes, the Poles, and the Lithuanians. YourGovernment still exists....The active army considers these criminals with horror and contempt.Their acts of vandalism and pillage, their crimes, the Germanmentality with which they regard Russia-stricken down but not yetsurrendered-have alienated from them the entire people.Citizens, soldiers, valorous Cossacks of the garrison of Petrograd;send me your delegates so that I may know who are traitors to theircountry and who are not, that there may be avoided an effusion ofinnocent blood.Almost the same moment word ran from group to group that thebuilding was surrounded by Red Guards. An officer strode in, a redband around his arm, demanding the Mayor. A few minutes later heleft and old Schreider came out of his office, red and pale by turns."A special meeting of the Duma!" he cried. "Immediately!"In the big hall proceedings were halted. "All members of the Dumafor a special meeting!""What's the matter?""I don't know-going to arrest us-going to dissolve theDuma-arresting members at the door-" so ran the excited comments.In the Nicolai Hall there was barely room to stand. The Mayorannounced that troops were stationed at all the doors, prohibitingall exit and entrance, and that a Commissar had threatened arrestand the dispersal of the Municipal Duma. A flood of impassionedspeeches from members, and even from the galleries, responded. Thefreely-elected City Government could not be dissolved by _any_power; the Mayor's person and that of all the members wereinviolable; the tyrants, the provocators, the German agents shouldnever be recognised; as for these threats to dissolve us, let themtry-only over our dead bodies shall they seize this chamber, wherelike the Roman senators of old we await with dignity the coming ofthe Goths....Resolution, to inform the Dumas and Zemstvos of all Russia bytelegraph. Resolution, that it was impossible for the Mayor or theChairman of the Duma to enter into any relations whatever withrepresentatives of the Military Revolutionary Committee or with theso-called Council of People's Commissars. Resolution, to addressanother appeal to the population of Petrograd to stand up for thedefence of their elected town government. Resolution, to remain inpermanent session....In the meanwhile one member arrived with the information that he hadtelephoned to Smolny, and that the Military Revolutionary Committeesaid that no orders had been given to surround the Duma, that thetroops would be withdrawn....As we went downstairs Riazanov burst in through the front door, veryagitated."Are you going to dissolve the Duma?" I asked."My God, no!" he answered. "It is all a mistake. I told the Mayorthis morning that the Duma would be left alone....Out on the Nevsky, in the deepening dusk, a long double file ofcyclists came riding, guns slung on their shoulders. They halted,and the crowd pressed in and deluged them with questions."Who are you? Where do you come from?" asked a fat old man with acigar in his mouth."Twelfth Army. From the front. We came to support the Sovietsagainst the damn' bourgeoisie!""Ah!" were furious cries. "Bolshevik gendarmes! Bolshevik Cossacks!"A little officer in a leather coat came running down the steps. "Thegarrison is turning!" he muttered in my ear. "It's the beginning ofthe end of the Bolsheviki. Do you want to see the turn of the tide?Come on!" He started at a half-trot up the Mikhailovsky, and wefollowed."What regiment is it?""The _brunnoviki_...." Here was indeed serious trouble. The_brunnoviki_ were the Armoured Car troops, the key to the situation;whoever controlled the _brunnoviki_ controlled the city. "TheCommissars of the Committee for Salvation and the Duma have beentalking to them. There's a meeting on to decide...."Decide what? Which side they'll fight on?""Oh, no. That's not the way to do it. They'll never fight againstthe Bolsheviki. They will vote to remain neutral-and then the_yunkers_ and Cossacks-"The door of the great Mikhailovsky Riding-School yawned blackly. Twosentinels tried to stop us, but we brushed by hurriedly, deaf totheir indignant expostulations. Inside only a single arc-lightburned dimly, high up near the roof of the enormous hall, whoselofty pilasters and rows of windows vanished in the gloom. Arounddimly squatted the monstrous shapes of the armoured cars. One stoodalone in the centre of the place, under the light, and round it weregathered some two thousand dun-colored soldiers, almost lost in theimmensity of that imperial building. A dozen men, officers, chairmenof the Soldiers' Committees and speakers, were perched on top of thecar, and from the central turret a soldier was speaking. This wasKhanjunov, who had been president of last summer's all-RussianCongress of _Brunnoviki._ A lithe, handsome figure in his leathercoat with lieutenant's shoulder-straps, he stood pleading eloquentlyfor neutrality."It is an awful thing," he said, "for Russians to kill their Russianbrothers. There must not be civil war between soldiers who stoodshoulder to shoulder against the Tsar, and conquered the foreignenemy in battles which will go down in history! What have we,soldiers, got to do with these squabbles of political parties? Iwill not say to you that the Provisional Government was a democraticGovernment; we want no coalition with the bourgeoisie-no. But wemust have a Government of the united democracy, or Russia is lost!With such a Government there will be no need for civil war, and thekilling of brother by brother!"This sounded reasonable-the great hall echoed to the crash of handsand voices.A soldier climbed up, his face white and strained, "Comrades!" hecried, "I came from the Rumanian front, to urgently tell you all:there must be peace! Peace at once! Whoever can give us peace,whether it be the Bolsheviki or this new Government, we will follow.Peace! We at the front cannot fight any longer. We cannot fighteither Germans or Russians-" With that he leaped down, and a sort ofconfused agonised sound rose up from all that surging mass, whichburst into something like anger when the next speaker, a Menshevik_oboronetz,_ tried to say that the war must go on until the Allieswere victorious."You talk like Kerensky!" shouted a rough voice.A Duma delegate, pleading for neutrality. Him they listened to,muttering uneasily, feeling him not one of them. Never have I seenmen trying so hard to understand, to decide. They never moved, stoodstaring with a sort of terrible intentness at the speaker, theirbrows wrinkled with the effort of thought, sweat standing out ontheir foreheads; great giants of men with the innocent clear eyes ofchildren and the faces of epic warriors....Now a Bolshevik was speaking, one of their own men, violently, fullof hate. They liked him no more than the other. It was not theirmood. For the moment they were lifted out of the ordinary run ofcommon thoughts, thinking in terms of Russia, of Socialism, theworld, as if it depended on them whether the Revolution were to liveor die....Speaker succeeded speaker, debating amid tense silence, roars ofapproval, or anger: should we come out or not? Khanjunov returned,persuasive and sympathetic. But wasn't he an officer, and an_oboronotz,_ however much he talked of peace? Then a workman fromVasili Ostrov, but him they greeted with, "And are _you_ going togive us peace, working-man?" Near us some men, many of themofficers, formed a sort of _claque_ to cheer the advocates ofNeutrality. They kept shouting, "Khanjunov! Khanjunov!" and whistledinsultingly when the Bolsheviki tried to speak.Suddenly the committeemen and officers on top of the automobilebegan to discuss something with great heat and much gesticulation.The audience shouted to know what was the matter, and all the greatmass tossed and stirred. A soldier, held back by one of theofficers, wrenched himself loose and held up his hand."Comrades!" he cried, "Comrade Krylenko is here and wants to speakto us." An outburst of cheers, whistlings, yells of _"Prosim!Prosim! Dolby!_ Go ahead! Go ahead! Down with him!" in the midst ofwhich the People's Commissar for Military Affairs clambered up theside of the car, helped by hands before and behind, pushed andpulled from below and above. Rising he stood for a moment, and thenwalked out on the radiator, put his hands on his hips and lookedaround smiling, a squat, short-legged figure, bare-headed, with-outinsignia on his uniform.The _claque_ near me kept up a fearful shouting, "Khanjunov! We wantKhanjunov! Down with him! Shut up! Down with the traitor!" The wholeplace seethed and roared. Then it began to move, like an avalanchebearing down upon us, great black-browed men forcing their waythrough."Who is breaking up our meeting?" they shouted. "Who is whistlinghere?" The _claque,_ rudely burst asunder, went flying-nor did itgather again...."Comrade soliders!" began Krylenko, in a voice husky with fatigue."I cannot speak well to you; I am sorry; but I have not had anysleep for four nights...."I don't need to tell you that I am a soldier. I don't need to tellyou that I want peace. What I must say is that the Bolshevik party,successful in the Workers' and Soldiers' Revolution, by the help ofyou and of all the rest of the brave comrades who have of you and ofall the rest of the brave comrades who have hurled down forever thepower of the blood-thirsty bourgeoisie, promised to offer peace toall the peoples, and that has already been done-to-day!" Tumultuousapplause."You are asked to remain neutral--to remain neutral while the_yunkers_ and the Death Battalions, who are _never_ neutral, shootus down in the streets and bring back to Petrograd Kerensky-orperhaps some other of the gang. Kaledin is marching from the Don.Kerensky is coming from the front. Kornilov is raising the_Tekhintsi_ to repeat his attempt of August. All these Menshevikiand Socialist Revolutionaries who call upon you now to prevent civilwar-how have they retained the power except by civil war, that civilwar which has endured ever since last July, and in which theyconstantly stood on the side of the bourgeoisie, as they do now?"How can I persuade you, if you have made up your minds? Thequestion is very plain. On one side are Kerensky, Kaledin, Kornilov,the Mensheviki, Socialist Revolutionaries, Cadets, Dumas, officers....They tell us that their objects are good. On the other side are theworkers, the soldiers and sailors, the poorest peasants. TheGovernment is in your hands. You are the masters. Great Russiabelongs to you. Will you give it back?"While he spoke, he kept himself up by sheer evident effort of will,and as he went on the deep sincere feeling back of his words brokethrough the tired voice. At the end he totered, almost falling; ahundred hands reached up to help him down, and the great dim spacesof the hall gave back the surf of sound that beat upon him.Khanjunov tried to speak again, but "Vote! Vote! Vote!" they cried.At length, giving in, he read the resolution: that the _brunnoviki_withdraw their representative from the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, and declare their neutrality in the present civil war.All those in favour should go to the right; those opposed, to theleft. There was a moment of hesitation, a still expectancy, and thenthe crowd began to surge faster and faster, stumbling over oneanother, to the left, hundreds of big soldiers in a solid massrushing across the dirt floor in the faint light.... Near us aboutfifty men were left stranded, stubbornly in favour, and even as thehigh roof shook under the shock of victorious roaring, they turnedand rapidly walked out of the building-and, some of them, out of theRevolution....Imagine this struggle being repeated in every barracks of the city,the district, the whole front, all Russia. Imagine the sleeplessKrylenkos, watching the regiments, hurrying from place to place,arguing, threatening, entreating. And then imaging the same in allthe locals of every labour union, in the factories, the villages, onthe battle-ships of the far-flung Russian fleets; think of thehundreds of thousands of Russian men staring up at speakers all overthe vast country, workmen, peasants, soldiers, sailors, trying sohard to understand and to choose, thinking so intensely-and decidingso unanimously at the end. So was the Russian Revolution....Up at Smolny the new Council of People's Commissars was not idle.Already the first decree was on the presses, to be circulated inthousands through the city streets that night, and shipped in balesby every train southward and east:In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic, chosen by theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputieswith participation of peasant deputies, the Council of People'sCommissars decrees:1. The elections for the Constituent Assembly shall take place atthe date determined upon-November 12.2. All electoral commissions, organs of local self-government,Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, and soldiers'organisations on the front should make every effort to assure freeand regular elections at the date determined upon.In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic, _ThePresident of the Council of People's Commissars_,VLADIMIR ULIANOV-LENIN.In the Municipal building the Duma was in full blast. A member ofthe Council of the Republic was talking as we came in. The Council,he said, did not consider itself dissolved at all, but merely unableto continue its labours until it secured a new meeting-place. In themeanwhile, its Committee of Elders had determined to enter _enmasse_ the Committee for Salvation.... This, I may remarkparenthetically, is the last time history mentions the Council ofthe Russian Republic....Then followed the customary string of delegates from the Ministries,the _Vikzhel,_ the Union of Posts and Telegraphs, for the hundredthtime reiterating their determination not to work for the Bolshevikusurpers. A _yunker_ who had been in the Winter Palace told ahighly-coloured tale of the heroism of himself and his comrades, anddisgraceful conduct of the Red Guards-all of which was devoutlybelieved. Somebody read aloud an account in the SocialistRevolutionary paper _Narod,_ which stated that five hundred millionrubles' worth of damage had been done in the Winter Palace, anddescribing in great detail the loot and breakage.From time to time couriers came from the telephone with news. Thefour Socialist Ministers had been released from prison. Krylenko hadgone to Peter-Paul to tell Admiral Verderevsky that the Ministry ofMarine was deserted, and to beg him, for the sake of Russia, to takecharge under the authority of the Council of People's Commissars;and the old seaman had consented.... Kerensky was advancing north fromGatchina, the Bolshevik garrisons falling back before him. Smolnyhad issued another decree, enlarging the powers of the City Dumas todeal with food supplies.This last piece of insolence caused an outburst of fury. He, Lenin,the usurper, the tyrant, whose Commissars had seized the Municipalgarage, entered the Municipal ware houses, were interfering with theSupply Committees and the distribution of food-he presumed to definethe limits of power of the free, independent, autonomous CityGovernment! One member, shaking his fist, moved to cut off the foodof the city if the Bolsheviki dared to interfere with the SupplyCommittees.... Another, representative of the Special SupplyCommittee, reported that the food situation was very grave, andasked that emissaries be sent out to hasten food trains.Diedonenko announced dramatically that the garrison was wavering.The Semionovsky regiment had already decided to submit to the ordersof the Socialist Revolutionary party; the crews of the torpedo-boatson the Neva were shaky. Seven members were at once appointed tocontinue the propaganda....Then the old Mayor stepped into the tribune: "Comrades and citizens!I have just learned that the prisoners in Peter Paul are in danger.Fourteen _yunkers_ of the Pavlovsk school have been stripped andtortured by the Bolshevik guards. One has gone mad. They arethreatening to lynch the Ministers!" There was a whirlwind ofindignation and horror, which only grew more violent when a stockylittle woman dressed in grey demanded the floor, and lifted up herhard, metallic voice. This was Vera Slutskaya, veteran revolutionistand Bolshevik member of the Duma."That is a lie and a provocation!" she said, unmoved at the torrentof abuse. "The Workers' and Peasants' Government, which hasabolished the death penalty, cannot permit such deeds. We demandthat this story be investigated, at once; if there is any truth init, the Government will take energetic measures!"A commission composed of members of all parties was immediatelyappointed, and with the Mayor, sent to Peter Paul to investigate. Aswe followed them out, the Duma was appointing another commission tomeet Kerensky--to try and avoid bloodshed when he entered thecapital....It was midnight when we bluffed our past the guards at the gate ofthe fortress, and went forward under the faint glimmer of rareelectric lights along the side of the church where lie the tombs ofthe Tsars, beneath the slender golden spire and the chimes, which,for months, continued to play _Bozhe Tsaria Khrani [*]_ every day at[* "God Save the Tsar."noon.... The place was deserted; in most of the windows there were noteven lights. Occasionally we bumped into a burly figure stumblingalong in the dark, who answered questions with the usual, _"Yanieznayu."_[Graphic page-166 Pass to Reed fromDepartment of Prisons   translation follows]Pass from the Department of Prisons of the Soviet Government tovisit freely all prisons of Petrograd and Cronstadt.

No. 213Petrograd, SmolnyInstitute, room No. 56-                      PASSTo the representative of the American Socialist press, JOHN REED, tovisit all places of confinement in the cities of Petrograd andCronstadt, for the purpose of generally investigating the conditionof the prisoners, and for thorough social information for thepurpose of stopping the flood of newspaper lies against demorcracy.       Chief Commissar       SecretaryOn the left loomed the low dark outline of Trubetskoi Bastion, thatliving grave in which so many martyrs of liberty had lost theirlives or their reason in the days of the Tsar, where the ProvisionalGovernment had in turn shut up the Ministers of the Tsar, and nowthe Bolsheviki had shut up the Ministers of the ProvisionalGovernment.A friendly sailor led us to the office of the commandant, in alittle house near the Mint. Half a dozen Red Guards, sailors andsoldiers were sitting around a hot room full of smoke, in which asamovar steamed cheerfully. They welcomed us with great cordiality,offering tea. The commandant was not in; he was escorting acommission of _"sabotazhniki"_ (sabotageurs) from the City Duma, whoinsisted that the _yunkers_ were all being murdered. This seemed toamuse them very much. At one side of the room sat a bald-headed,dissipated-looking little man in a frock-coat and a rich fur coat,biting his moustache and staring around him like a cornered rat. Hehad just been arrested. Somebody said, glancing carelessly at him,that he was a Minister or something.... The little man didn't seem tohear it; he was evidently terrified, although the occupants of theroom showed no animosity whatever toward him.I went across and spoke to him in French. "Count Tolstoy," heanswered, bowing stiffly. "I do not understand why I was arrested. Iwas crossing the Troitsky Bridge on my way home when two of these-ofthese-persons held me up. I was a Commissar of the ProvisionalGovernment attached to the General Staff, but in no sense a memberof the Government...""Let him go,"said a sailor. "He's harmless....""No," responded the soldier who had brought the prisoner. "We mustask the commandant.""Oh, the commandant!" sneered the sailor. "What did you make arevolution for? To go on obeying officers?"A _praporshtchik_ of the Pavlovsky regiment was telling us how theinsurrection started. "The _polk_ (regiment) was on duty at theGeneral Staff the night of the 6th. Some of my comrades and I werestanding guard; Ivan Pavlovitch and another man-I don't remember hisname-well, they hid behind the window-curtains in the room where theStaff was having a meeting, and they heard a great many things. For   any things. For   |          |example, they heard orders to bring the Gatchina _yunkers_ toPetrograd by night, and an order for the Cossacks to be ready tomarch in the morning.... The principal points in the city were to beoccupied before dawn. Then there was the business of opening thebridges. But when they began to talk about surrounding Smolny, thenIvan Pavlovitch couldn't stand it any longer. That minute there wasa good deal of coming and going, so he slipped out and came down tothe guard-room,leaving the other comrade to pick up what he could."I was already suspicious that something was going on. Automobilesfull of officers kept coming, and all the Ministers were there. IvanPavlovitch told me what he had heard. It was half-past two in themorning. The secretary of the regimental Committee was there, so wetold him and asked what to do."'Arrest everybody coming and going!#' he says. So we began to doit. In an hour we had some officers and a couple of Ministers, whomwe sent up to Smolny right away. But the Military RevolutionaryCommittee wasn't ready; they didn't know what to do; and pretty soonback came the order to let everybody go and not arrest anybody else.Well, we ran all the way to Smolny, and I guess we talked for anhour before they finally saw that it was war. It was five o'clockwhen we got back to the Staff, and by that time most of them weregone. But we got a few, and the garrison was all on the march...."A Red Guard from Vasili Ostrov described in great detail what hadhappened in his district on the great day of the rising. "We didn'thave any machine-guns over there," he said, laughing, "and wecouldn't get any from Smolny. Comrade Zalking, who was a member ofthe _Uprava_ (Central Bureau) of the Ward Duma, remembered all atonce that there was lying in the meeting-room of the _Uprava_ amachinegun which had been captured from the Germans. So he and I andanother comrade went there. The Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries were having a meeting. Well, we opened the door andwalked right in on them, as they sat around the table-twelve orfifteen of them, three of us. When they saw us they stopped talkingand just stared. We walked right across the room, uncoupled themachine-gun; Comrade Zalkind picked up one part, I the other, we putthem on our shoulders and walked out-and not a single man said aword!""Do you know how the Winter Palace was captured?" asked a third man,a sailor. "Along about eleven o'clock we found out there weren't anymore _yunkers_ on the Neva side. So we broke in the doors andfiltered up the different stairways one by one, or in littlebunches. When we got to the top of the stairs the _yunkers_ held usup and took away our guns. Still our fellows kept coming up, littleby little, until we had a majority. Then we turned around and tookaway the _yunkers'_ guns...."Just then the commandant entered-a merry-looking youngnon-commissioned officer with his arm in a sling, and deep circlesof sleeplessness under his eyes. His eye fell first on the prisoner,who at once began to explain."Oh, yes," interrupted the other. "You were one of the committee whorefused to surrender the Staff Wednesday afternoon. However, wedon't want you, citizen. Apologies-" He opened the door and wavedhis arm for Count Tolstoy to leave. Several of the others,especially the Red Guards, grumbled protests, and the sailorremarked triumphantly, _"Vot!_ There! Didn't I say so?"Two soldiers now engaged his attention. They had been elected acommittee of the fortress garrison to protest. The prisoners, theysaid, were getting the same food as the guards, when there wasn'teven enough to keep a man from being hungry. "Why should thecounter-revolutionists be treated so well?""We are revolutionists, comrades, not bandits," answered thecommandant. He turned to us. We explained that rumours were goingabout that the _yunkers_ were being tortured, and the lives of theMinisters threatened. Could we perhaps see the prisoners, so as tobe able to prove to the world-?""No," said the young soldier, irritably. "I am not going to disturbthe prisoners again. I have just been compelled to wake them up-theywere sure we were going to massacre them.... Most of the _yunkers_have been released anyway, and the rest will go out to-morrow." Heturned abruptly away."Could we talk to the Duma commission, then?"The Commandant, who was pouring himself a glass of tea, nodded."They are still out in the hall," he said carelessly.Indeed they stood there just outside the door, in the feeble lightof an oil lamp, grouped around the Mayor and talking excitedly."Mr. Mayor," I said, "we are American correspondents. Will youplease tell us officially the result of your investigations?"He turned to us his face of venerable dignity."There is no truth in the reports," he said slowly. "Except for theincidents which occurred as the Ministers were being brought here,they have been treated with every consideration. As for the_yunkers,_ not one has received the slightest injury...."Up the Nevsky, in the empty after-midnight gloom, an interminablecolumn of soldiers shuffled in silence-to battle with Kerensky. Indim back streets automobiles without lights flitted to and fro, andthere was furtive activity in Fontanka 6, headquarters of thePeasants' Soviet, in a certain apartment of a huge building on theNevsky, and in the _Injinierny Zamok_ (School of Engineers); theDuma was illuminated....In Smolny Institute the Military Revolutionary Committee flashedbaleful fire, pounding like an over-loaded dynamo....                              Chapter VII                          The Revolutionary FrontSATURDAY, November 10th....Citizens!The Military Revolutionary Committee declares that it will nottolerate any violation of revolutionary order....Theft, brigandage, assaults and attempts at massacre will beseverely punished....Following the example of the Paris Commune, the Committee willdestroy without mercy any looter or instigator of disorder....Quiet lay the city. Not a hold-up, not a robbery, not even a drunkenfight. By night armed patrols went through the silent streets, andon the corners soldiers and Red Guards squatted around little fires,laughing and singing. In the daytime great crowds gathered on thesidewalks listening to interminable hot debates between students andsoldiers, business men and workmen.Citizens stopped each other on the street."The Cossacks are coming?""No....""What's the latest?""I don't know anything. Where's Kerensky?""They say only eight versts from Petrograd.... Is it true that theBolsheviki have fled to the battleship _Avrora?"_"They say so...."Only the walls screamed, and the few newspapers; denunciation,appeal, decree....An enormous poster carried the hysterical manifesto of the ExecutiveCommittee of the Peasant' Soviets:....They (the Bolsheviki) dare to say that they are supported by theSoviets of Peasants' Deputies, and that they are speaking on behalfof the Soviets of Peasants' Deputies....Let all working-class Russia know that this is a LIE, AND THAT ALLTHE WORKING PEASANTS-in the person of-the EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THEALL-RUSSIAN SOVIETS OF PEASANTS' DEPUTIES-refutes with indignationall participation of the organised peasantry in this criminalviolation of the will of the working-classes....From the Soldier Section of the Socialist Revolutionary party:The insane attempt of the Bolsheviki is on the eve of collapse. Thegarrison is divided.... The Ministries are on strike and bread isgetting scarcer. All factions except the few Bolsheviki have leftthe Congress. The Bolsheviki are alone....We call upon all sane elements to group themselves around theCommittee for Salvation of Country and Revolution, and to preparethemselves seriously to be ready at the first call of the CentralCommittee....In a hand-bill the Council of the Republic recited its wrongs:Ceding to the force of bayonets, the Council of the Republic hasbeen obliged to separate, and temporarily to interrupt its meetings.The usurpers, with the words "Liberty and Socialism" on their lips,have set up a rule of arbitrary violence. They have arrested themembers of the Provisional Government, closed the newspapers, seizedthe printing-shops....This power must be considered the enemy of thepeople and the Revolution; it is necessary to do battle with it, andto pull it down....The Council of the Republic, until the resumption of its labours,invites the citizens of the Russian Republic to group themselvesaround the....local Committees for Salvation of Country andRevolution, which are organising the overthrow of the Bolsheviki andthe creation of a Government capable of leading the country to theConstituent Assembly._Dielo Naroda_said:A revolution is a rising of all the people.... But here what have we?Nothing but a handful of poor fools deceived by Lenin and Trotzky....Their decrees and their appeals will simply add to the museum ofhistorical curiosities....And _Narodnoye Slovo_(People'sWord-PopulistSocialist):"Workers' and Peasants' Government?" That is only a pipedream;nobody, either in Russia or in the countries of our Allies, willrecognise this "Government"-or even in the enemy countries....The bourgeois press had temporarily disappeared...._Pravada_ had anaccount of the first meeting of the new _Tsay-ee-kah,_ now theparliament of the Russian Soviet Republic. Miliutin, Commissar ofAgriculture, remarked that the Peasants' Executive Committee hadcalled an All-Russian Peasant Congress for December 13th."But we cannot wait," he said. "We must have the backing of thepeasants. I propose that _we_ call the Congress of Peasants, and doit immediately...." The Left Socialist Revolutionaries agreed. AnAppeal to the Peasants of Russia was hastily drafted, and acommittee of five elected to carry out the project.The question of detailed plans for distributing the land, and thequestion of Workers' Control of Industry, were postponed until theexperts working on them should submit a report.Three decrees (See App. VII, Sect. 1) were read and approved: first,Lenin's "General Rules For the Press," ordering the suppression ofall newspapers inciting to resistance and disobedience to the newGovernment, inciting to criminal acts, or deliberately pervertingthe news; the Decree of Moratorium for House-rents; and the DecreeEstablishing a Workers' Militia. Also orders, one giving theMunicipal Duma power to requisition empty apartments and houses, theother directing the unloading of freight cars in the railroadterminals, to hasten the distribution of necessities and to free thebadly-needed rolling-stock....Two hours later the Executive Committee of the Peasants' Soviets wassending broadcast over Russia the following telegram:The arbitrary organisation of the Bolsheviki, which is called"Bureau of Organisation for the National Congress of Peasants,"isinviting all the Peasants' Soviets to send delegates to the Congressat Petrograd....The Executive Committee of the Soviets of Peasants' Deputiesdeclares that it considers, now as well as before, that it would bedangerous to take away from the provinces at this moment the forcesnecessary to prepare for elections to the Constituent Assembly,which is the only salvation of the working-class and the country. Weconfirm the date of the Congress of Peasants, _December 13th._At the Duma all was excitement, officers coming and going, the Mayorin conference with the leaders of the Committee for Salvation. ACouncillor ran in with a copy of Kerensky's proclamation, dropped byhundreds from an aeroplane low flying down the Nevsky, whichthreatened terrible vengeance on all who did not submit, and orderedsoldiers to lay down their arms and assemble immediately in MarsField.The Minister-President had taken Tsarskoye Selo, we were told, andwas already in the Petrograd campagna, five miles away. He wouldenter the city to-morrow-in a few hours. The Soviet troops incontact with his Cossacks were said to be going over to theProvisional Government. Tchernov was somewhere in between, trying toorganise the "neutral" troops into a force to halt the civil war.In the city the garrison regiments were leaving the Bolsheviki, theysaid. Smolny was already abandoned.... All the Governmental machineryhad stopped functioning. The employees of the State Bank had refusedto work under Commissars from Smolny, refused to pay out money tothem. All the private banks were closed. The Ministries were onstrike. Even now a committee from the Duma was making the rounds ofbusiness houses, collecting a fund to pay the salaries of thestrikers....Trotzky had gone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ordered theclerks to translate the Decree on Peace into foreign languages; sixhundred functionaries had hurled their resignations in his face....Shliapnikov, Commissar of Labour, had commanded all the employees ofhis Ministry to return to their places within twenty-four hours, orlose their places and their pension-rights; only the door-servantshad responded.... Some of the branches of the Special Food SupplyCommittee had suspended work rather than submit to the Bolsheviki....In spite of lavish promises of high wages and better conditions, theoperators at the Telephone Exchange would not connect Sovietheadquarters....The Socialist Revolutionary Party had voted to expel all members whohad remained in the Congress of Soviets, and all who were takingpart in the insurrection....News from the provinces. Moghilev had declared against theBolsheviki. At Kiev the Cossacks had overthrown the Soviets andarrested all the insurrectionary leaders. The Soviet and garrison ofLuga, thirty thousand strong, affirmed its loyalty to theProvisional Government, and appealed to all Russia to rally aroundit. Kaledin had dispersed all Soviets and Unions in the Don Basin,and his forces were moving north....Said a representative of the Railway Workers: "Yesterday we sent atelegram all over Russia demanding that war between the politicalparties cease at once, and insisting on the formation of a coalitionSocialist Government. Otherwise we shall call a strike to-morrownight.... In the morning there will be a meeting of all factions toconsider the question. The Bolsheviki seem anxious for anagreement....""If they last that long!" laughed the City Engineer, a stout, ruddyman....As we came up to Smolny-not abandoned, but busier than ever, throngsof workers and soldiers running in and out, and doubled guardseverywhere-we met the reporters for the bourgeois and "moderate"Socialist papers."Threw us out!" cried one, from _Volia Naroda._ "Bonch-Bruevitchcame down to the Press Bureau and told us to leave! Said we werespies!" They all began to talk at once: "Insult! Outrage! Freedom ofthe press!"In the lobby were great tables heaped with stacks of appeals,proclamations and orders of the Military Revolutionary Committee.Workmen and soldiers staggered past, carrying them to waitingautomobiles.One began:TO THE PILLORY!In this tragic moment through which the Russian masses are living,the Mensheviki and their followers and the Right SocialistRevolutionaries have betrayed the working-class. They have enlistedon the side of Kornilov, Kerensky and Savinkov....They are printing orders of the traitor Kerensky and creating apanic in the city, spreading the most ridiculous rumours of mythicalvictories by that renegade....Citizens! Don't believe these false rumours. No power can defeat thePeople's Revolution.... Premier Kerensky and his followers awaitspeedy and well-deserved punishment....We are putting them in the Pillory. We are abandoning them to theenmity of all workers, soldiers, sailors and peasants, on whom theyare trying to rivet the ancient chains. They will never be able towash from their bodies the stain of the people's hatred and contempt.Shame and curses to the traitors of the People!...The Military Revolutionary Committee had moved into larger quarters,room 17 on the top floor. Red Guards were at the door. Inside, thenarrow space in front of the railing was crowded with well-dressedpersons, outwardly respectful but inwardly full of murder-bourgeoiswho wanted permits for their automobiles, or passports to leave thecity, among them many foreigners.... Bill Shatov and Peters were onduty. They suspended all other business to read us the latestbulletins.The One Hundred Seventy-ninth Reserve Regiment offers its unanimoussupport. Five thousand stevedores at the Putilov wharves greet thenew Government. Central Committee of the Trade Unions-enthusiasticsupport. The garrison and squadron at Reval elect MilitaryRevolutionary Committees to cooperate, and despatch troops. MilitaryRevolutionary Committees control in Pskov and Minsk. Greetings fromthe Soviets of Tsaritzin, Rovensky-on-Don, Tchernogorsk,Sevastopol.... The Finland Division, the new Committees of the Fifthand Twelfth Armies, offer allegiance....From Moscow the news is uncertain. Troops of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee occupy the strategic points of the city; twocompanies on duty in the Kremlin have gone over to the Soviets, butthe Arsenal is in the hands of Colonel Diabtsev and his _yunkers._The Revolutionary Committee demanded arms for the workers, andRiabtsev parleyed with them until this morning, when suddenly hesent an ultimatum to the Committee, ordering Soviet troops tosurrender and the Committee to disband. Fighting has begun....In Petrograd the Staff submitted to Smolny's Commissars at once. The_Tsentroflot,_ refusing, was stormed by Dybenko and a company ofCronstadt sailors, and a new _Tsentroflot_ set up, supported by theBaltic and the Black Sea battleships....But beneath all the breezy assurance there was a chill premonition,a feeling of uneasiness in the air. Kerensky's Cossacks were comingfast; they had artillery. Skripnik, Secretary of the Factory-ShopCommittees, his face drawn and yellow, assured me that there was awhole army corps of them, but he added, fiercely, "They'll nevertake us alive!" Petrovsky laughed weariedly, "To-morrow maybe we'llget a sleep-a long one...." Lozovsky, with his emaciated, red-beardedface, said, "What chance have we? All alone.... A mob against trainedsoldiers!"South and south-west the Soviets had fled before Kerensky, and thegarrisons of Gatchina, Pavlovsk, Tsarskoye Selo were divided-halfvoting to remain neutral, the rest, without officers, falling backon the capital in the wildest disorder.In the halls they were pasting up bulletins:FROM KRASNOYE SELO, NOVEMBER 10TH, 8 A.M._To be communicated to all Commanders of Staffs, Commanders inChief, Commanders, everywhere and to all, all, all._The ex-Minister Kerensky has sent a deliberately false telegram toevery one everywhere to the effect that the troops of revolutionaryPetrograd have voluntarily surrendered their arms and joined thearmies of the former Government, the Government of Treason, and thatthe soldiers have been ordered by the Military RevolutionaryCommittee to retreat. The troops of a free people do not retreat nordo they surrender.Our troops have left Gatchina in order to avoid bloodshed betweenthemselves and their mistaken brother-Cossacks, and in order to takea more convenient position, which is at present so strong that ifKerensky and his companions in arms should even increase theirforces ten times, still there would be no cause for anxiety. Thespirit of our troops is excellent.In Petrograd all is quiet._Chief of the Defence of Petrograd and the Petrograd District,_Lieutenant-Colonel Muraviov.As we left the Military Revolutionary Committee Antonov entered, apaper in his hand, looking like a corpse."Send this," said he.TO ALL DISTRICT SOVIETS OF WORKERS' DEPUTIES AND FACTORYSHOPCOMMITTEESThe Kornilovist bands of Kerensky are threatening the approaches tothe capital. All the necessary orders have been given to crushmercilessly the counter-revolutionary attempt against the people andits conquests.The Army and the Red Guard of the Revolution are in need of theimmediate support of the workers.WE ORDER THE WARD SOVIETS AND FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES:1. To move out the greatest possible number of workers for thedigging of trenches, the erection of barricades and reinforcing ofwire entanglements.2. Wherever it shall be necessary for this purpose to stop work atthe factories this shall be done immediately.3. All common and barbed wire available must be assembled, and alsoall implements for the digging of trenches and the erection ofbarricades.4. All available arms must be taken.5. THE STRICTEST DISCIPLINE IS TO BE OBSERVED, AND EVERY ONE MUST BEREADY TO SUPPORT THE ARMY OF THE REVOLUTION BY ALL MEANS._Chairman of the Petrograd Soviet of Worker's and Soldiers'Deputies,_People's Commissar LEON TROTZKY._Chairman of the Military Revolutionary Committee,_Commander in Chief PODVOISKY.As we came out into the dark and gloomy day all around the greyhorizon factory whistles were blowing, a hoarse and nervous sound,full of foreboding. By tens of thousands the working-people pouredout, men and women; by tens of thousands the humming slums belchedout their dun and miserable hordes. Red Petrograd was in danger!Cossacks! South and southwest they poured through the shabby streetstoward the Moskovsky Gate, men, women and children, with rifles,picks, spades, rolls of wire, cartridge-belts over their workingclothes.... Such an immense, spontaneous outpouring of a city neverwas seen! They rolled along torrent-like, companies of soldiersborne with them, guns, motor-trucks, wagons-the revolutionaryproletariat defending with its breast the capital of the Workers'and Peasants' Republic!Before the door of Smolny was an automobile. A slight man with thickglasses magnifying his red-rimmed eyes, his speech a painful effort,stood leaning against a mud-guard with his hands in the pockets of ashabby raglan. A great bearded sailor, with the clear eyes of youth,prowled restlessly about, absently toying with an enormousblue-steel revolver, which never left his hand. These were Antonovand Dybenko.Some soldiers were trying to fasten two military bicycles on therunning-board. The chauffeur violently protested; the enamel wouldget scratched, he said. True, he was a Bolshevik, and the automobilewas commandeered from a bourgeois; true, the bicycles were for theuse of orderlies. But the chauffeur's professional pride wasrevolted.... So the bicycles were abandoned....The People's Commissars for War and Marine were going to inspect therevolutionary front-wherever that was. Could we go with them?Certainly not. The automobile only held five-the two Commissars, twoorderlies and the chauffeur. However, a Russian acquaintance ofmine, whom I will call Trusishka, calmly got in and sat down, norcould any argument dislodge him....I see no reason to doubt Trusishka's story of the journey. As theywent down the Suvorovsky Prospect some one mentioned food. Theymight be out three or four days, in a country indifferently wellprovisioned. They stopped the car. Money? The Commissar of Warlooked through his pockets-he hadn't a kopek. The Commissar ofMarine was broke. So was the chauffeur. Trusishka bought theprovisions....Just as they turned into the Nevsky a tire blew out."What shall we do?" asked Antonov."Commandeer another machine!" suggested Dybenko, waving hisrevolver. Antonov stood in the middle of the street and signalled apassing machine, driven by a soldier."I want that machine," said Antonov."You won't get it," responded the soldier."Do you know who I am?" Antonov produced a paper upon which waswritten that he had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of all thearmies of the Russian Republic, and that every one should obey himwithout question."I don't care if you're the devil himself," said the soldier, hotly."This machine belongs to the First Machine-Gun Regiment, and we'recarrying ammunition in it, and you can't have it...."The difficulty, however, was solved by the appearance of an oldbattered taxi-cab, flying the Italian flag. (In time of troubleprivate cars were registered in the name of foreign consulates, soas to be safe from requisition.) From the interior of this wasdislodged a fat citizen in an expensive fur coat, and the partycontinued on its way.Arrived at Narvskaya Zastava, about ten miles out, Antonov calledfor the commandant of the Red Guard. He was led to the edge of thetown, where some few hundred workmen had dug trenches and werewaiting for the Cossacks."Everything all right here, comrade?" asked Antonov."Everything perfect, comrade," answered the commandant."The troops are in excellent spirits.... Only one thing-we have noammunition....""In Smolny there are two billion rounds," Antonov told him. "I willgive you an order." He felt in his pockets. "Has any one a piece ofpaper?"Dybenko had none-nor the couriers. Trusishka had to offer hisnote-book...."Devil! I have no pencil!" cried Antonov. "Who's got a pencil?"Needless to say, Trusishka had the only pencil in the crowd....We who were left behind made for the Tsarskoye Selo station. Up theNevsky, as we passed, Red Guards were marching, all armed, some withbayonets and some without. The early twilight of winter was falling.Heads up they tramped in the chill mud, irregular lines of four,without music, without drums. A red flag crudely lettered in gold,"Peace! Land!" floated over them. They were very young. Theexpression on their faces was that of who know they are going todie.... Half-fearful, half-contemptuous, the crowds on the sidewalkwatched them pass, in hateful silence....[Graphic page-184  Pass to the Northern Front]This pass was issued upon the recommendation of Trotzky three daysafter the Bolshevik Revolution. It gives me the right of free travelto the Northern front-and an added note on the back extends thepermission to all fronts. It will be noticed that the speaks of the_Petersburg_, instead of the _Petrograd_ Soviet; it was the fashionamong thorough-going internationalists to abolish all names whichsmacked of "patriotism"; but at the same time, it would not do torestore the "Saint."...                      (Translation)Executive CommitteePetrograd Soviet ofWorkers' and Soldiers'     Deputies  Military Section28th October, 1917    No. 1435                      CERTIFICATEThe present certificate is given to the representative of theAmerican Social Democracy, the internationalist comrade JOHN REED.The Military Revolutionary Committee of the Petersburg Soviet ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies gives him the right of free travelthrough the entire Northern front, for the purpose of reporting toour American comrades-internationalists concerning events in Russia.                              For the President                              For the SecretaryAt the railroad station nobody knew just where Kerensky was, orwhere the front lay. Trains went no further, however, thanTsarskoye....Our car was full of commuters and country people going home, ladenwith bundles and evening papers. The talk was all of the Bolshevikrising. Outside of that, however, one would never have realised thatcivil war was rending mighty Russia in two, and that the train washeaded into the zone of battle. Through the window we could see, inthe swiftly-deepening darkness, masses of soldiers going along themuddy road toward the city, flinging out their arms in argument. Afreight-train, swarming with troops and lit up by huge bonfires, washalted on a siding. That was all. Back along the flat horizon theglow of the city's lights faded down the night. A street-car crawleddistantly along a far-flung suburb....Tsarskoye Selo-station was quiet, but knots of soldiers stood hereand there talking in low tones and looking uneasily down the emptytrack in the direction of Gatchina. I asked some of them which sidethey were on. "Well," said one, "we don't exactly know the rights ofthe matter.... There is no doubt that Kerensky is a provocator, but wedo not consider it right for Russian men to be shooting Russian men."In the station commandant's office was a big, jovial, bearded commonsoldier, wearing the red arm-band of a regimental committee. Ourcredentials from Smolny commanded immediate respect. He was plainlyfor the Soviets, but bewildered."The Red Guards were here two hours ago, but they went away again. ACommissar came this morning, but he returned to Petrograd when theCossacks arrived.""The Cossacks are here then?"He nodded, gloomily. "There has been a battle. The Cossacks cameearly in the morning. They captured two or three hundred of our men,and killed about twenty-five.""Where are the Cossacks?""Well, they didn't get this far. I don't know just where they are.Off that way...." He waved his arm vaguely westward.We had dinner-an excellent dinner, better and cheaper than could begot in Petrograd-in the station restaurant. Nearby sat a Frenchofficer who had just come on foot from Gatchina. All was quietthere, he said. Kerensky held the town. "Ah, these Russians," hewent on, "they are original! What a civil war! Everything except thefighting!"We sallied out into the town. Just at the door of the station stoodtwo soldiers with rifles and bayonets fixed. They were surrounded byabout a hundred business men, Government officials and students, whoattacked them with passionate argument and epithet. The soldierswere uncomfortable and hurt, like children unjustly scolded.A tall young man with a supercilious expression, dressed in theuniform of a student, was leading the attack."You realise, I presume," he said insolently, "that by taking uparms against your brothers you are making your-selves the tools ofmurderers and traitors?""Now brother,"answered the soldier earnestly, "you don't understand.There are two classes, don't you see, the proletariat and thebourgeoisie. We--""Oh, I know that silly talk!" broke in the student rudely. "A bunchof ignorant peasants like you hear somebody bawling a fewcatch-words. You don't understand what they mean. You just echo themlike a lot of parrots." The crowd laughed. "I'm a Marxian student.And I tell you that this isn't Socialism you are fighting for. It'sjust plain pro-German anarchy!""Oh, yes, I know," answered the soldier, with sweat dripping fromhis brow. "You are an educated man, that is easy to see, and I amonly a simple man. But it seems to me--""I suppose," interrupted the other contemptuously, "that you believeLenin is a real friend of the proletariat?""Yes, I do," answered the soldier, suffering."Well, my friend, do you know that Lenin was sent through Germany ina closed car? Do you know that Lenin took money from the Germans?""Well, I don't know much about that," answered the soldierstubbornly, "but it seems to me that what he says is what I want tohear, and all the simple men like me. Now there are two classes, thebourgeoisie and the proletariat--""You are a fool! Why, my friend, I spent two years in Schlüsselburgfor revolutionary activity, when you were still shooting downrevolutionists and singing 'God Save the Tsar!' My name is VasiliGeorgevitch Panyin. Didn't you ever hear of me?""I'm sorry to say I never did," answered the soldier with humility."But then, I am not an educated man. You are probably a great hero.""I am," said the student with conviction. "And I am opposed to theBolsheviki, who are destroying our Russia, our free Revolution. Nowhow do you account for that?"The soldier scratched his head. "I can't account for it at all," hesaid, grimacing with the pain of his intellectual processes. "To meit seems perfectly simple-but then, I'm not well educated. It seemslike there are only two classes, the proletariat and thebourgeoisie--""There you go again with your silly formula!" cried the student."--only two classes," went on the soldier, doggedly.ldquo;And whoever isn't on one side is on the other..."We wandered on up the street, where the lights were few and farbetween, and where people rarely passed. A threatening silence hungover the place-as of a sort of purgatory between heaven and hell, apolitical No Man's Land. Only the barber shops were all brilliantlylighted and crowded, and a line formed at the doors of the publicbath; for it was Saturday night, when all Russia bathes and perfumesitself. I haven't the slightest doubt that Soviet troops andCossacks mingled in the places where these ceremonies were performed.The nearer we came to the Imperial Park, the more deserted were thestreets. A frightened priest pointed out the headquarters of theSoviet, and hurried on. It was in the wing of one of the Grand Ducalpalaces, fronting the Park. The windows were dark, the door locked.A soldier, lounging about with his hands in the top of his trousers,looked us up and down with gloomy suspicion. "The Soviet went awaytwo days ago," said he. "Where?" A shrug. _"Nie znayu._ I don'tknow."A little further along was a large building, brightly illuminated.From within came a sound of hammering. While we were hesitating, asoldier and a sailor came down the street, hand in hand. I showedthem my pass from Smolny. "Are you for the Soviets?" I asked. Theydid not answer, but looked at each other in a frightened way."What is going on in there?" asked the sailor, pointing to thebuilding."I don't know."Timidly the soldier put out his hand and opened the door a crack.Inside a great hall hung with bunting and evergreens, rows ofchairs, a stage being built.A stout woman with a hammer in her hand and her mouth full of tackscame out. "What do you want?" she asked."Is there a performance to-night?" said the sailor, nervously."There will be private theatricals Sunday night," she answeredseverely. "Go away."We tried to engage the soldier and sailor in conversation, but theyseemed frightened and unhappy, and drew off into the darkness.We strolled toward the Imperial Palaces, along the edge of the vast,dark gardens, their fantastic pavilions and ornamental bridgeslooming uncertainly in the night, and soft water splashing from thefountains. At one place, where a ridiculous iron swan spatunceasingly from an artificial grotto, we were suddenly aware ofobservation, and looked up to encounter the sullen, suspicious gazeof half a dozen gigantic armed soldiers, who stared moodily downfrom a grassy terrace. I climbed up to them. "Who are you?" I asked."We are the guard," answered one. They all looked very depressed, asundoubtedly they were, from weeks and weeks of all-day all-nightargument and debate."Are you Kerensky's troops, or the Soviets'?"There was silence for a moment, as they looked uneasily at eachother. Then, "We are neutral," said he.We went on through the arch of the huge Ekaterina Palace, into thePalace enclosure itself, asking for headquarters. A sentry outside adoor in a curving white wing of the Palace said that the commandantwas inside.In a graceful, white, Georgian room, divided into unequal parts by atwo-sided fire-place, a group of officers stood anxiously talking.They were pale and distracted, and evidently hadn't slept. To one,an oldish man with a white beard, his uniform studded withdecorations, who was pointed out as the Colonel, we showed ourBolshevik papers.He seemed surprised. "How did you get here without being killed?" heasked politely. "It is very dangerous in the streets just now.Political passion is running very high in Tsarskoye Selo. There wasa battle this morning, and there will be another to-morrow morning.Kerensky is to enter the town at eight o'clock.""Where are the Cossacks?""About a mile over that way." He waved his arm."And you will defend the city against them?""Oh dear no." He smiled. "We are holding the city for Kerensky." Ourhearts sank, for our passes stated that we were revolutionary to thecore. The Colonel cleared his throat. "About those passes of yours,"he went on. "Your lives will be in danger if you are captured.Therefore, if you want to see the battle, I will give you an orderfor rooms in the officers' hotel, and if you will come back here atseven o'clock in the morning, I will give you new passes.""So you are for Kerensky?" we said."Well, not exactly _for_ Kerensky." The Colonel hesitated. "You see,most of the soldiers in the garrison are Bolsheviki, and to-day,after the battle, they all went away in the direction of Petrograd,taking the artillery with them. You might say that none of the_soldiers_ are for Kerensky; but some of them just don't want tofight at all. The _officers_ have almost all gone over to Kerensky'sforces, or simply gone away. We are-ahem-in a most difficultposition, as you see...."We did not believe that there would be any battle.... The Colonelcourteously sent his orderly to escort us to the railroad station.He was from the South, born of French immigrant parents inBessarabia. "Ah," he kept saying, "it is not the danger or thehardships I mind, but being so long, three years, away from mymother...."Looking out of the window of the train as we sped through the colddark toward Petrograd, I caught glimpses of clumps of soldiersgesticulating in the light of fires, and of clusters of armouredcars halted together at cross-roads, the chauffeurs hanging out ofthe turrets and shouting to each other....All the troubled night over the bleakflats leaderless bands ofsoldiers and Red Guards wandered, clashing and confused, and theCommissars of the Military Revolutionary Committee hurried from onegroup to another, trying to organise a defence....Back in town excited throngs were moving in tides up and down theNevsky. Something was in the air. From the Warsaw Railway stationcould be heard far-off cannonade. In the _yunker_ schools there wasfeverish activity. Duma members went from barracks to barracks,arguing and pleading, narrating fearful stories of Bolshevikviolence-massacre of the _yunkers_ in the Winter Palace, rape of thewomen soldiers, the shooting of the girl before the Duma, the murderof Prince Tumanov.... In the Alexander Hall of the Duma building theCommittee for Salvation was in special session; Commissars came andwent, running.... All the journalists expelled from Smolny were there,in high spirits. They did not believe our report of conditions inTsarskoye. Why, everybody knew that Tsarskoye was in Kerensky'shands, and that the Cossacks were now at Pulkovo. A committee wasbeing elected to meet Kerensky at the railway station in themorning....One confided to me, in strictest secrecy, that thecounter-revolution would begin at midnight. He showed me twoproclamations, one signed by Gotz and Polkovnikov, ordering the_yunker_ schools, soldier convalescents in the hospitals, and theKnights of St. George to mobilise on a war footing and wait fororders from the Committee for Salvation; the other from theCommittee for Salvation itself, which read as follows:To the Population of Petrograd!Comrades, workers, soldiers and citizens of revolutionary Petrograd!  nary Petrograd!  |          |The Bolsheviki, while appealing for peace at the front, are incitingto civil war in the rear.Do not dig their provocatory appeals!Do not dig trenches!Down with the traitorous barricades!Lay down your arms!Soldiers, return to your barracks!The war begun in Petrograd-is the death of the Revolution!In the name of liberty, land, and peace, unite around the Committeefor Salvation of Country and Revolution!As we left the Duma a company of Red Guards, stern-faced anddesperate, came marching down the dark, deserted street with a dozenprisoners-members of the local branch of the Council of Cossacks,caught red-handed plotting counter-revolution in their headquarters....A soldier, accompanied by a small boy with a pail of paste, wassticking up great flaring notices:By virtue of the present, the city of Petrograd and its suburbs aredeclared in a state of siege. All assemblies or meetings in thestreets, and generally in the open air, are forbidden until furtherorders.N. PODVOISKY, President of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee.As we went home the air was full of confused sound-automobile horns,shouts, distant shots. The city stirred uneasily, wakeful.In the small hours of the morning a company of _yunkers,_ disguisedas soldiers of the Semionovsky Regiment, presented themselves at theTelephone Exchange just before the hour of changing guard. They hadthe Bolshevik password, and took charge without arousing suspicion.A few minutes later Antonov appeared, making a round of inspection.Him they captured and locked in a small room. When the relief cameit was met by a blast of rifle-fire, several being killed.Counter-revolution had begun...                              Chapter VIII                            Counter-RevolutionNEXT morning, Sunday the 11th, the Cossacks entered Tsarskoye Selo,Kerensky (See App. VIII, Sect. 1) himself riding a white horse andall the church-bells clamouring. From the top of a little hilloutside the town could be seen the golden spires and many-colouredcupolas, the sprawling grey immensity of the capital spread alongthe dreary plain, and beyond, the steely Gulf of Finland.There was no battle. But Kerensky made a fatal blunder. At seven inthe morning he sent word to the Second Tsarskoye Selo Rifles to laydown their arms. The soldiers replied that they would remainneutral, but would not disarm. Kerensky gave them ten minutes inwhich to obey. This angered the soldiers; for eight months they hadbeen governing themselves by committee, and this smacked of the oldrégime.... A few minutes later Cossack artillery opened fire on thebarracks, killing eight men. From that moment there were no more"neutral" soldiers in Tsarskoye....Petrograd woke to bursts of rifle-fire, and the tramping thunder ofmen marching. Under the high dark sky a cold wind smelt of snow. Atdawn the Military Hotel and the Telegraph Agency had been taken bylarge forces of _yunkers,_ and bloodily recaptured. The TelephoneStation was besieged by sailors, who lay behind barricades ofbarrels, boxes and tin sheets in the middle of the Morskaya, orsheltered themselves at the corner of the Gorokhovaya and of St.Isaac's Square, shooting at anything that moved. Occasionally anautomobile passed in and out, flying the Red Cross flag. The sailorslet it pass....Albert Rhys Williams was in the Telephone Exchange. He went out withthe Red Cross automobile, which was ostensibly full of wounded.After circulating about the city, the car went by devious ways tothe Mikhailovsky _yunker_ school, headquarters of thecounter-revolution. A French officer, in the court-yard, seemed tobe in command.... By this means ammunition and supplies were conveyedto the Telephone Exchange. Scores of these pretended ambulancesacted as couriers and ammunition trains for the _yunkers._Five or six armoured cars, belonging to the disbanded BritishArmoured Car Division, were in their hands. As Louise Bryant wasgoing along St. Isaac's Square one came rolling up from theAdmiralty, on its way to the Telephone Exchange. At the corner ofthe Gogolia, right in front of her, the engine stalled. Some sailorsambushed behind wood-piles began shooting. The machine-gun in theturret of the thing slewed around and spat a hail of bulletsindiscriminately into the wood-piles and the crowd. In the archwaywhere Miss Bryant stood seven people were shot dead, among them twolittle boys. Suddenly, with a shout, the sailors leaped up andrushed into the flaming open; closing around the monster, theythrust their bayonets into the loop-holes, again and again, yelling...The chauffeur pretended to be wounded, and they let him go free-torun to the Duma and swell the tale of Bolshevik atrocities....Amongthe dead was a British Officer....Later the newspapers told of another French officer, captured in a_yunker_ armoured car and sent to Peter-Paul. The French Embassypromptly denied this, but one of the City Councillors told me thathe himself had procured the officer's release from prison....Whatever the official attitude of the Allied Embassies, individualFrench and British officers were active these days, even to theextent of giving advice at executive sessions of the Committee forSalvation.All day long in every quarter of the city there were skirmishesbetween _yunkers_ and Red Guards, battles between armoured cars....Volleys, single shots and the shrill chatter of machine-guns couldbe heard, far and near. The iron shutters of the shops were drawn,but business still went on. Even the moving-picture shows, alloutside lights dark, played to crowded houses. The street-cars ran.The telephones were all working; when you called Central, shootingcould be plainly heard over the wire.... Smolny was cut off, but theDuma and the Committee for Salvation were in constant communicationwith all the _yunker_ schools and with Kerensky at Tsarskoye.At seven in the morning the Vladimir _yunker_ school was visited bya patrol of soldiers, sailors and Red Guards, who gave the _yunkers_twenty minutes to lay down their arms. The ultimatum was rejected.An hour later the _yunkers_ got ready to march, but were driven backby a violent fusillade from the corner of the Grebetskaya and theBolshoy Prospekt. Soviet troops surrounded the building and openedfire, two armoured cars cruising back and forth with machine gunsraking it. The _yunkers_ telephoned for help. The Cossacks repliedthat they dare not come, because a large body of sailors with twocannon commanded their barracks. The Pavlovsk school was surrounded.Most of the Mikhailov _yunkers_ were fighting in the streets....At half-past eleven three field-pieces arrived. Another demand tosurrender was met by the _yunkers_ shooting down two of the Sovietdelegates under the white flag. Now began a real bombardment. Greatholes were torn in the walls of the school. The _yunkers_ defendedthemselves desperately; shouting waves of Red Guards, assaulting,crumpled under the withering blast.... Kerensky telephoned fromTsarskoye to refuse all parley with the Military RevolutionaryCommittee.Frenzied by defeat and their heaps of dead, the Soviet troops openeda tornado of steel and flame against the battered building. Theirown officers could not stop the terrible bombardment. A Commissarfrom Smolny named Kirilov tried to halt it; he was threatened withlynching. The Red Guards' blood was up.At half-past two the _yunkers_ hoisted a white flag; they wouldsurrender if they were guaranteed protection. This was promised.With a rush and a shout thousands of soldiers and Red Guards pouredthrough windows, doors and holes in the wall. Before it could bestopped five _yunkers_ were beaten and stabbed to death. The rest,about two hundred, were taken to Peter-Paul under escort, in smallgroups so as to avoid notice. On the way a mob set upon one party,killing eight more _yunkers_.... More than a hundred Red Guards andsoldiers had fallen....Two hours later the Duma got a telephone message that the victorswere marching toward the _Injinierny Zamok_-the Engineers' school. Adozen members immediately set out to distribute among them armfulsof the latest proclamation of the Committee for Salvation. Severaldid not come back.... All the other schools surrendered withoutresistance, and the _yunkers_ were sent unharmed to Peter-Paul andCronstadt....The Telephone Exchange held out until afternoon, when a Bolshevikarmoured car appeared, and the sailors stormed the place. Shrieking,the frightened telephone girls ran to and fro; the _yunkers_ torefrom their uniforms all distinguishing marks, and one offeredWilliams _anything_ for the loan of his overcoat, as a disguise...."They will massacre us! They will massacre us!" they cried, for manyof them had given their word at the Winter Palace not to take uparms against the People. Williams offered to mediate if Antonov werereleased. This was immediately done; Antonov and Williams madespeeches to the victorious sailors, inflamed by their many dead-andonce more the _yunkers_ went free.... All but a few, who in theirpanic tried to flee over the roofs, or to hide in the attic, andwere found and hurled into the street.Tired, bloody, triumphant, the sailors and workers swarmed into theswitchboard room, and finding so many pretty girls, fell back in anembarrassed way and fumbled with awkward feet. Not a girl wasinjured, not one insulted. Frightened, they huddled in the corners,and then, finding themselves safe, gave vent to their spite. "Ugh!The dirty, ignorant people! The fools!"... The sailors and Red Guardswere embarrassed. "Brutes! Pigs!" shrilled the girls, indignantlyputting on their coats and hats. Romantic had been their experiencepassing up cartridges and dressing the wounds of their dashing youngdefenders, the _yunkers,_ many of them members of noble families,fighting to restore their beloved Tsar! These were just commonworkmen, peasants, "Dark People."...The Commissar of the Military Revolutionary Committee, littleVishniak, tried to persuade the girls to remain. He was effusivelypolite. "You have been badly treated," he said. "The telephonesystem is controlled by the Municipal Duma. You are paid sixtyrubles a month, and have to work ten hours and more.... From now onall that will be changed. The Government intends to put thetelephones under control of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs.Your wages will be immediately raised to one hundred and fiftyrubles, and your working-hours reduced. As members of theworking-class you should be happy--"Members of the _working-class_ indeed! Did he mean to infer thatthere was anything in common between these-these animals-and _us?_Remain? Not if they offered a thousand rubles!... Haughty and spitefulthe girls left the place....The employees of the building, the line-men and labourers-theystayed. But the switch-boards must be operated-the telephone wasvital.... Only half a dozen trained operators were available.Volunteers were called for; a hundred responded, sailors, soldiers,workers. The six girls scurried backward and forward, instructing,helping, scolding.... So, crippled, halting, but _going,_ the wiresslowly began to hum. The first thing was to connect Smolny with thebarracks and the factories; the second, to cut off the Duma and the_yunker_ schools.... Late in the afternoon word of it spread throughthe city, and hundreds of bourgeois called up to scream, "Fools!Devils! How long do you think you will last? Wait till the Cossackscome!"Dusk was already falling. On the almost deserted Nevsky, swept by abitter wind, a crowd had gathered before the Kazan Cathedral,continuing the endless debate; a few workmen, some soldiers and therest shop-keepers, clerks and the like."But Lenin won't get Germany to make peace!" cried one.A violent young soldier replied. "And whose fault is it? Your damnKerensky, dirty bourgeois! To hell with Kerensky! We don't want him!We want Lenin...."Outside the Duma an officer with a white arm-band was tearing downposters from the wall, swearing loudly. One read:To the Population of Petrograd!At this dangerous hour, when the Municipal Duma ought to use everymeans to calm the population, to assure it bread and othernecessities, the Right Socialist Revolutionaries and the Cadets,forgetting their duty, have turned the Duma into acounter-revolutionary meeting, trying to raise part of thepopulation against the rest, so as to facilitate the victory ofKornilov-Kerensky. Instead of doing their duty, the Right SocialistRevolutionaries and the Cadets have transformed the Duma into anarena of political attack upon the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers'and Peasants' Deputies, against the revolutionary Government ofpeace, bread and liberty.Citizens of Petrograd, we, the Bolshevik Municipal Councillorselected by you-we want you to know that the Right SocialistRevolutionaries and the Cadets are engaged in counter-revolutionaryaction, have forgotten their duty, and are leading the population tofamine, to civil war. We, elected by 183,000 votes, consider it ourduty to bring to the attention of our constituents what is going onin the Duma, and declare that we disclaim all responsibility for theterrible but inevitable consequences....Far away still sounded occasional shots, but the city lay quiet,cold, as if exhausted by the violent spasms which had torn it.In the Nicolai Hall the Duma session was coming to an end. Even thetruculent Duma seemed a little stunned. One after another theCommissars reported-capture of the Telephone Exchange,street-fighting, the taking of the Vladimir school.... "The Duma,"said Trupp, "is on the side of the democracy in its struggle againstarbitrary violence; but in any case, whichever side wins, the Dumawill always be against lynchings and torture...."Konovski, Cadet, a tall old man with a cruel face: "When the troopsof the legal Government arrive in Petrograd, they will shoot downthese insurgents, and that will not be lynching!" Protests all overthe hall, even from his own party.Here there was doubt and depression. The counter-revolution wasbeing put down. The Central Committee of the Socialist Revolutionaryparty had voted lack of confidence in its officers; the left wingwas in control; Avksentiev had resigned. signed. A courier reportedthat the Committee of Welcome sent to meet Kerensky at the railwaystation had been arrested. In the streets could be heard the dullrumble of distant cannonading, south and southwest. Still Kerenskydid not come...Only three newspapers were out-_Pravda, Dielo Naroda_ and _NovayaZhizn._ All of them devoted much space to the new "coalition"Government. The Socialist Revolutionary paper demanded a Cabinetwithout either Cadets or Bolsheviki. Gorky was hopeful; Smolny hadmade concessions. A purely Socialist Government was taking shape-allelements except the bourgeoisie. As for _Pravda,_ it sneered:We ridicule these coalitions with political parties whose mostprominent members are petty journalists of doubtful reputation; our"coalition" is that of the proletariat and the revolutionary Armywith the poor peasants...On the walls a vainglorious announcement of the _Vikzhel,_threatening to strike if both sides did not compromise:The conquerors of these riots, the saviours of the wreck of ourcountry, these will be neither the Bolsheviki, nor the Committee forSalvation, nor the troops of Kerensky-but we, the Union ofRailwaymen...Red Guards are incapable of handling a complicated business like therailways; as for the Provisional Government, it has shown itselfincapable of holding the power...We refuse to lend our services to any party which does not act byauthority of ... a Government based on the confidence of all thedemocracy....Smolny thrilled with the boundless vitality of inexhaustiblehumanity in action.In Trade Union headquarters Lozovsky introduced me to a delegate ofthe Railway Workers of the Nicolai line, who said that the men wereholding huge mass-meetings, condemning the action of their leaders."All power to the Soviets!" he cried, pounding on the table."The_oborontsi_ in the Central Committee are playingKo&rgrave;nilov's game. They tried to send a mission to the Stavka,but we arrested them at Minsk.... Our branch has demanded anAll-Russian Convention, and they refuse to call it...."The same situation as in the Soviets, the Army Committees. One afteranother the various democratic organisations, all over Russia, werecracking and changing. The Cooperatives were torn by internalstruggles; the meetings of the Peasants' Executive broke up instormy wrangling; even among the Cossacks there was trouble....On the top floor the Military Revolutionary Committee was in fullblast, striking and slacking not. Men went in, fresh and vigorous;night and day and night and day they threw themselves into theterrible machine; and came out limp, blind with fatigue, hoarse andfilthy, to fall on the floor and sleep.... The Committee for Salvationhad been outlawed. Great piles of new proclamations (See App. VIII,Sect. 2) littered the floor:... The conspirators, who have no support among the garrison or theworking-class, above all counted on the suddenness of their attack.Their plan was discovered in time by Sub-Lieutenant Blagonravov,thanks to the revolutionary vigilance of a soldier of the Red Guard,whose name shall be made public. At the centre of the plot was theCommittee for Salvation. Colonel Polkovnikov was in command of theirforces, and the orders were signed by Gotz, former member of theProvisional Government, allowed at liberty on his word of honour....Bringing these facts to the attention of the Petrograd population,the Military Revolutionary Committee orders the arrest of allconcerned in the conspiracy, who shall be tried before theRevolutionary Tribunal....From Moscow, word that the _yunkers_ and Cossacks had surrounded theKremlin and ordered the Soviet troops to lay down their arms. TheSoviet forces complied, and as they were leaving the Kremlin, wereset upon and shot down. Small forces of Bolsheviki had been drivenfrom the Telephone and Telegraph offices; the _yunkers_ now held thecentre of the city. ... But all around them the Soviet troops weremustering. Street-fighting was slowly gathering way; all attempts atcompromise had failed.... On the side of the Soviet, ten thousandgarrison soldiers and a few Red Guards; on the side of theGovernment, six thousand _yunkers,_ twenty-five hundred Cossacks andtwo thousand White Guards.The Petrograd Soviet was meeting, and next door the new_Tsay-ee-kah,_ acting on the decrees and orders (See App. VIII,Sect. 3) which came down in a steady stream from the Council ofPeople's Commissars in session upstairs; on the Order in Which LawsAre to be Ratified and Published, Establishing an Eight hour Daysfor Workers, and Lunatcharsky's "Basis for a System of PopularEducation." Only a few hundred people were present at the twomeetings, most of them armed. Smolny was almost deserted, except forthe guards, who were busy at the hall windows, setting upmachine-guns to command the flanks of the building.In the _Tsay-ee-kah_ a delegate of the _Vikzhel_ was speaking: "Werefuse to transport the troops of either party.... We have sent acommittee to Kerensky to say that if he continues to march onPetrograd we will break his lines of communication...."He made the usual plea for a conference of all the Socialist partiesto form a new Government....Kameniev answered discreetly. The Bolsheviki would be very glad toattend the conference. The centre of gravity, however, lay not incomposition of such a Government, but in its acceptance of theprogramme of the Congress of Soviets.... The _Tsay-ee-kah_ had deliberated on the declaration made by theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries and the Social DemocratsInternationalists, and had accepted the proposition of proportionalrepresentation at the conference, even including delegates from theArmy Committees and the Peasants' Soviets....In the great hall, Trotzky recounted the events of the day."We offered the Vladimir _yunkers_ a chance to surrender," he said."We wanted to settle matters without bloodshed. But now that bloodhas been spilled there is only one way-pitiless struggle. It wouldbe childish to think we can win by any other means.... The moment isdecisive. Everybody must cooperate with the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, report where there are stores of barbed wire, benzine,guns.... We've won the power; now we must keep it!"The Menshevik Yoffe tried to read his party's declaration, butTrotzky refused to allow "a debate about principle.""Our debates are now in the streets," he cried. "The decisive stephas been taken. We all, and I in particular, take the responsibilityfor what is happening...."Soldiers from the front, from Gatchina, told their stories. One fromthe Death Battalion, Four Hundred Eighty-first Artillery: "When thetrenches hear of this, they will cry, 'This is _our_ Government!'" A_yunker_ from Peterhof said that he and two others had refused tomarch against the Soviets; and when his comrades had returned fromthe defence of the Winter Palace they appointed him their Commissar,to go to Smolny and offer their services to the _real_ Revolution....Then Trotzky again, fiery, indefatigable, giving orders, answeringquestions."The petty bourgeoisie, in order to defeat the workers, soldiers andpeasants, would combine with the devil himself!" he said once. Manycases of drunkenness had been remarked the last two days. "Nodrinking, comrades! No one must be on the streets after eight in theevening, except the regular guards. All places suspected of havingstores of liquor should be searched, and the liquor destroyed. (SeeApp. VIII, Sect. 4) No mercy to the sellers of liquor...."The Military Revolutionary Committee sent for the delegation fromthe Viborg section; then for the members from Putilov. They clumpedout hurriedly."For each revolutionist killed," said Trotzky, "we shall kill fivecounter-revolutionists!"Down-town again. The Duma brilliantly illuminated and great crowdspouring in. In the lower hall wailing and cries of grief; the throngsurged back and forth before the bulletin board, where was posted alist of _yunkers_ killed in the day's fighting-or supposed to bekilled, for most of the dead afterward turned up safe and sound.... Upin the Alexander Hall the Committee for Salvation held forth. Thegold and red epaulettes of officers were conspicuous, the familiarfaces of the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary intellectuals,the hard eyes and bulky magnificence of bankers and diplomats,officials of the old régime, and well-dressed women....The telephone girls were testifying. Girl after girl came to thetribune-over-dressed, fashion-aping little girls, with pinched facesand leaky shoes. Girl after girl, flushing with pleasure at theapplause of the "nice" people of Petrograd, of the officers, therich, the great names of politics-girl after girl, to narrate hersufferings at the hands of the proletariat, and proclaim her loyaltyto all that was old, established and powerful....The Duma was again in session in the Nicolai Hall. The Mayor saidhopefully that the Petrograd regiments were ashamed of theiractions; propaganda was making headway.[Graphic page-205 Proclamation for "wine pogroms" ]Revolutionary law and order. A proclamation of the Finland Regiment,in December, 1917, announcing desperate remedies for "wine pogroms."For translation see Appendix 5.... Emissaries came and went, reporting horrible deeds by theBolsheviki, interceding to save the _yunkers,_ busily investigating...."The Bolsheviki," said Trupp, "will be conquered by moral force, andnot by bayonets....."Meanwhile all was not well on the revolutionary front. The enemy hadbrought up armoured trains, mounted with cannon. The Soviet forces,mostly raw Red Guards, were without officers and without a definiteplan. Only five thousand regular soldiers had joined them; the restof the garrison was either busy suppressing the _yunker_ revolt,guarding the city, or undecided what to do. At ten in the eveningLenin addressed a meeting of delegates from the city regiments, whovoted overwhelmingly to fight. A Committee of five soldiers waselected to serve as General Staff, and in the small hours of themorning the regiments left their barracks in full battle array....Going home I saw them pass, swinging along with the regular tread ofveterans, bayonets in perfect alignment, through the desertedstreets of the conquered city....At the same time, in the headquarters of the _Vikzhel_ down on theSadovaya, the conference of all the Socialist parties to form a newGovernment was under way. Abramovitch, for the centre Mensheviki,said that there should be neither conquerors nor conquered-thatbygones should be bygones. ...In this were agreed all the left wingparties. Dan, speaking in the name of the right Mensheviki, proposedto the Bolsheviki the following conditions for a truce: The RedGuard to be disarmed, and the Petrograd garrison to be placed at theorders of the Duma; the troops of Kerensky not to fire a single shotor arrest a single man; a Ministry of all the Socialist parties_except the Bolsheviki._ For Smolny Riazanov and Kameniev declaredthat a coalition ministry of all parties was acceptable, butprotested at Dan's proposals. The Socialist Revolutionaries weredivided; but the Executive Committee of the Peasants's Soviets andthe Populist Socialists flatly refused to admit the Bolsheviki....After bitter quarrelling a commission was elected to draw up aworkable plan....All that night the commission wrangled, and all the next day, andthe next night. Once before, on the 9th of November, there had beena similar effort at conciliation, led by Martov and Gorky; but atthe approach of Kerensky and the activity of the Committee forSalvation, the right wing of the Mensheviki, SocialistRevolutionaries and Populist Socialists suddenly withdrew. Now theywere awed by the crushing of the _yunker_ rebellion...Monday the 12th was a day of suspense. The eyes of all Russia werefixed on the grey plain beyond the gates of Petrograd, where all theavailable strength of the old order faced the unorganised power ofthe new, the unknown. In Moscow a truce had been declared; bothsides parleyed, awaiting the result in the capital. Now thedelegates to the Congress of Soviets, hurrying on speeding trains tothe farthest reaches of Asia, were coming to their homes, carryingthe fiery cross. In wide-spreading ripples news of the miraclespread over the face of the land, and in its wake towns, cities andfar villages stirred and broke, Soviets and Military RevolutionaryCommittees against Dumas, Zemstvos and Government Commissars-RedGuards against White-street fighting and passionate speech.... Theresult waited on the word from Petrograd....Smolny was almost empty, but the Duma was thronged and noisy. Theold Mayor, in his dignified way, was protesting against the Appealof the Bolshevik Councillors."The Duma is not a centre of counter-revolution," he said, warmly."The Duma takes no part in the present struggle between the parties.But at a time when there is no legal power in the land, the onlycentre of order is the Municipal Self-Government. The peacefulpopulation recognises this fact; the foreign Embassies recogniseonly such documents as are signed by the Mayor of the town. The mindof a European does not admit of any other situation, as theMunicipal self-government is the only organ which is capable ofprotecting the interests of the citizens. The City is bound to showhospitality, to all organisations which desire to profit by suchhospitality, and therefore the Duma cannot prevent the distributionof any newspapers whatever within the Duma building. The sphere ofour work is increasing, and we must be given full liberty of action,and our rights must be respected by both parties...."We are perfectly neutral. When the Telephone Exchange was occupiedby the _yunkers_ Colonel Polkovnikov ordered the telephones toSmolny disconnected, but I protested, and the telephones were keptgoing...."At this there was ironic laughter from the Bolshevik benches, andimprecations from the right."And yet," went on Schreider, "they look upon us ascounter-revolutionaries and report us to the population. Theydeprive us of our means of transport by taking away our lastmotor-cars. It will not be our fault if there is famine in the town.Protests are of no use...."Kobozev, Bolshevik member of the Town Board, was doubtful whetherthe Military Revolutionary Committee had requisitioned the Municipalautomobiles. Even granting the fact, it was probably done by someunauthorised individual, in the emergency."The Mayor," he continued, "tells us that we must not make politicalmeetings out of the Duma. But every Menshevik and SocialistRevolutionary here talks nothing but party propaganda, and at thedoor they distribute their illegal newspapers, _Iskri_ (Sparks),_Soldatski Golos_ and _Rabotchaya Gazeta,_ inciting to insurrection.What if we Bolsheviki should also begin to distribute our papershere? But this shall not be, for we respect the Duma. We have notattacked the Municipal Self-Government, and we shall not do so. Butyou have addressed an Appeal to the population, and we are entitledalso to do so....Followed him Shingariov, Cadet, who said that there could be nocommon language with those who were liable to be brought before theAttorney General for indictment, and who must be tried on the chargeof treason.... He proposed again that all Bolshevik members should beexpelled from the Duma. This was tabled, however, for there were nopersonal charges against the members, and they were active in theMunicipal administration.Then two Mensheviki Internationalists, declaring that the Appeal ofthe Bolshevik Councillors was a direct incitement to massacre. "Ifeverything that is against the Bolsheviki is counter-revolutionary,"said Pinkevitch, "then I do not know the difference betweenrevolution and anarchy.... The Bolsheviki are depending upon thepassions of the unbridled masses; we have nothing but moral force.We will protest against massacres and violence from both sides, asour task is to find a peaceful issue.""The notice posted in the streets under the heading 'To thePillory,' which calls upon the people to destroy the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries," said Nazariev, "is a crime which you,Bolsheviki, will not be able to wash away. Yesterday's horrors arebut a preface to what you are preparing by such a proclamation.... Ihave always tried to reconcile you with the other parties, but atpresent I feel for you nothing but contempt!"The Bolshevik Councillors were on their feet, shouting angrily,assailed by hoarse, hateful voices and waving arms....Outside the hall I ran into the City Engineer, the Menshevik Gombergand three or four reporters. They were all in high spirits."See!" they said. "The cowards are afraid of us. They don't darearrest the Duma! Their Military Revolutionary Committee doesn't dareto send a Commissar into this building. Why, on the corner of theSadovaya to-day, I saw a Red Guard try to stop a boy selling_Soldatski Golos_.... The boy just laughed at him, and a crowd ofpeople wanted to lynch the bandit. It's only a few hours more, now.Even if Kerensky wouldn't come they haven't the men to run aGovernment. Absurd! I understand they're even fighting amongthemselves at Smolny!"A Socialist Revolutionary friend of mine drew me aside. "I knowwhere the Committee for Salvation is hiding," he said. "Do you wantto go and talk with them?"By this time it was dusk. The city had again settled down tonormal-shop-shutters up, lights shining, and on the streets greatcrowds of people slowly moving up and down and arguing....At Number 86 Nevsky we went through a passage into a courtyard,surrounded by tall apartment buildings. At the door of apartment 229my friend knocked in a peculiar way. There was a sound of scuffling;an inside door slammed; then the front door opened a crack and awoman's face appeared. After a minute's observation she led us in-aplacid-looking, middle-aged lady who at once cried, "Kyril, it's allright!" In the dining-room, where a samovar steamed on the table andthere were plates full of bread and raw fish, a man in uniformemerged from behind the window-curtains, and another, dressed like aworkman, from a closet. They were delighted to meet an Americanreporter. With a certain amount of gusto both said that they wouldcertainly be shot if the Bolsheviki caught them. They would not giveme their names, but both were Socialist Revolutionaries...."Why," I asked, "do you publish such lies in your newspapers?"Without taking offence the officer replied, "Yes, I know; but whatcan we do?" He shrugged. "You must admit that it is necessary for usto create a certain frame of mind in the people...."The other man interrupted. "This is merely an adventure on the partof the Bolsheviki. They have no intellectuals. ... The Ministrieswon't work.... Russia is not a city, but a whole country.... Realisingthat they can only last a few days, we have decided to come to theaid of the strongest force opposed to them-Kerensky-and help torestore order.""That is all very well," I said. "But why do you combine with theCadets?"The pseudo-workman smiled frankly. "To tell you the truth, at thismoment the masses of the people are following the Bolsheviki. Wehave no following-now. We can't mobilise a handful of soldiers.There are no arms available.... The Bolsheviki are right to a certainextent; there are at this moment in Russia only two parties with anyforce-the Bolsheviki and the reactionaries, who are all hiding underthe coat-tails of the Cadets. The Cadets think they are using us;but it is really we who are using the Cadets. When we smash theBolsheviki we shall turn against the Cadets....""Will the Bolsheviki be admitted into the new Government?"He scratched his head. "That's a problem," he admitted. "Of courseif they are not admitted, they'sll probably do this all over again.At any rate, they will have a chance to hold the balance of power inthe Constituent-that is, if there _is_ a Constituent.""And then, too," said the officer, "that brings up the question ofadmitting the Cadets into the new Government-and for the samereasons. You know the Cadets do not really want the ConstituentAssembly-not if the Bolsheviki can be destroyed now." He shook hishead. "It is not easy for us Russians, politics. You Americans areborn politicians; you have had politics all your lives. But forus-well, it has only been a year, you know!""What do you think of Kerensky?" I asked."Oh, Kerensky is guilty of the sins of the Provisional Government,"answered the other man. "Kerensky himself forced us to acceptcoalition with the bourgeoisie. If he had resigned, as hethreatened, it would have meant a new Cabinet crisis only sixteenweeks before the Constituent Assembly, and that we wanted to avoid.""But didn't it amount to that anyway?""Yes, but how were we to know? They tricked us-the Kerenskys andAvksentievs. Gotz is a little more radical. I stand with Tchernov,who is a real revolutionist.... Why, only to-day Lenin sent word thathe would not object to Tchernov entering the Government."We wanted to get rid of the Kerensky Government too, but we thoughtit better to wait for the Constituent.... At the beginning of thisaffair I was with the Bolsheviki, but the Central Committee of myparty voted unanimously against it-and what could I do? It was amatter of party discipline...."In a week the Bolshevik Government will go to pieces; if theSocialist Revolutionaries could only stand aside and wait, theGovernment would fall into their hands. But if we wait a week thecountry will be so disorganised that the German imperialists will bevictorious. That is why we began our revolt with only two regimentsof soldiers promising to support us-and they turned against us....That left only the _yunkers_....""How about the Cossacks?"The officer sighed. "They did not move. At first they said theywould come out if they had infantry support. They said moreover thatthey had their men with Kerensky, and that they were doing theirpart.... Then, too, they said that the Cossacks were always accused ofbeing the hereditary enemies of democracy.... And finally, 'TheBolsheviki promise that they will not take away our land. There isno danger to us. We remain neutral.'"During this talk people were constantly entering and leaving-most ofthem officers, their shoulder-straps torn off. We could see them inthe hall, and hear their low, vehement voices. Occasionally, throughthe half-drawn portières, we caught a glimpse of a door opening intoa bath-room, where a heavily-built officer in a colonel's uniformsat on the toilet, writing something on a pad held in his lap. Irecognised Colonel Polkovnikov, former commandant of Petrograd, forwhose arrest the Military Revolutionary Committee would have paid afortune."Our programme?" said the officer. "This is it. Land to be turnedover to the Land Committees. Workmen to have full representation inthe control of industry. An energetic peace programme, but not anultimatum to the world such as the Bolsheviki issued. The Bolshevikicannot keep their promises to the masses, even in the countryitself. We won't let them.... They stole our land programme in orderto get the support of the peasants. That is dishonest. If they hadwaited for the Constituent Assembly-""It doesn't matter about the Constituent Assembly!" broke in theofficer. "If the Bolsheviki want to establish a Socialist statehere, we cannot work with them in any event! Kerensky made the greatmistake. He let the Bolsheviki know what he was going to do byannouncing in the Council of the Republic that he had ordered theirarrest...."But what," I said, "do you intend to do now?"The two men looked at one another. "You will see in a few days. Ifthere are enough troops from the front on our side, we shall notcompromise with the Bolsheviki. If not, perhaps we shall be forcedto...."Out again on the Nevsky we swung on the step of a streetcar bulgingwith people, its platforms bent down from the weight and scrapingalong the ground, which crawled with agonising slowness the longmiles to Smolny.Meshkovsky, a neat, frail little man, was coming down the hall,looking worried. The strikes in the Ministries, he told us, werehaving their effect. For instance, the Council of People'sCommissars had promised to publish the Secret Treaties; but Neratov,the functionary in charge, had disappeared, taking the documentswith him. They were supposed to be hidden in the British Embassy....Worst of all, however, was the strike in the banks. "Without money,"said Menzhinsky, "we are helpless. The wages of the railroad men, ofthe postal and telegraph employees, must be paid.... The banks areclosed; and the key to the situation, the State Bank, is also shut.All the bank-clerks in Russia have been bribed to stop work...."But Lenin has issued an order to dynamite the State Bank vaults,and there is a Decree just out, ordering the private banks to opento-morrow, or we will open them ourselves!"The Petrograd Soviet was in full swing, thronged with armed men,Trotzky reporting:"The Cossacks are falling back from Krasnoye Selo." (Sharp, exultantcheering.) "But the battle is only beginning. At Pulkovo heavyfighting is going on. All available forces must be hurried there...."From Moscow, bad news. The Kremlin is in the hands of the_yunkers,_ and the workers have only a few arms. The result dependsupon Petrograd."At the front, the decrees on Peace and Land are provoking greatenthusiasm. Kerensky is flooding the trenches with tales ofPetrograd burning and bloody, of women and children massacred by theBolsheviki. But no one believes him...."The cruisers _Oleg, Avrora_ and _Respublica_ are anchored in theNeva, their guns trained on the approaches to the city....""Why aren't you out there with the Red Guards?" shouted a roughvoice."I'm going now!" answered Trotzky, and left the platform. His face alittle paler than usual, he passed down the side of the room,         e room,         |          |surrounded by eager friends, and hurried out to the waitingautomobile.Kameniev now spoke, describing the proceedings of the reconciliationconference. The armistice conditions proposed by the Mensheviki, hesaid, had been contemptuously rejected. Even the branches of theRailwaymen's Union had voted against such a proposition...."Now that we've won the power and are sweeping all Russia," hedeclared, "all they ask of us are three little things: 1. Tosurrender the power. 2. To make the soldiers continue the war. 3. Tomake the peasants forget about the land...."Lenin appeared for a moment, to answer the accusations of theSocialist Revolutionaries:"They charge us with stealing their land programme.... If that is so,we bow to them. It is good enough for us...."So the meeting roared on, leader after leader explaining, exhorting,arguing, soldier after soldier, workman after workman, standing upto speak his mind and his heart.... The audience flowed, changing andrenewed continually. From time to time men came in, yelling for themembers of such and such a detachment, to go to the front; others,relieved, wounded, or coming to Smolny for arms and equipment,poured in....It was almost three o'clock in the morning when, as we left thehall, Holtzman, of the Military Revolutionary Committee, camerunning down the hall with a transfigured face."It's all right!" he shouted, grabbing my hands. "Telegram from thefront. Kerensky is smashed! Look at this!"He held out a sheet of paper, scribbled hurriedly in pencil, andthen, seeing we couldn't read it, he declaimed aloud:Pulkovo. Staff. 2.10 A.M.The night of October 30th to 31st will go down in history. Theattempt of Kerensky to move counter-revolutionary troops against thecapital of the Revolution has been decisively repulsed. Kerensky isretreating, we are advancing. The soldiers, sailors and workers ofPetrograd have shown that they can and will with arms in their handsenforce the will and authority of the democracy. The bourgeoisietried to isolate the revolutionary army. Kerensky attempted to breakit by the force of the Cossacks. Both plans met a pitiful defeat.The grand idea of the domination of the worker and peasant democracyclosed the ranks of the army and hardened its will. All the countryfrom now on will be convinced that the Power of the Soviets is noephemeral thing, but an invincible fact.... The repulse of Kerensky isthe repulse of the land-owners, the bourgeoisie and the Kornilovistsin general. The repulse of Kerensky is the confirmation of the rightof the people to a peaceful free life, to land, bread and power. ThePulkovo detachment by its valorous blow has strengthened the causeof the Workers' and Peasants's Revolution. There is no return to thepast. Before us are struggles, obstacles and sacrifices. But theroad is clear and victory is certain.Revolutionary Russia and the Soviet Power can be proud of theirPulkovo detachment, acting under the command of Colonel Walden.Eternal memory to those who fell! Glory to the warriors of theRevolution, the soldiers and the officers who were faithful to thePeople!Long live revolutionary, popular, Socialist Russia!In the name of the Council,L. TROTZKY, People's Commissar....Driving home across Znamensky Square, we made out an unusual crowdin front of the Nicolai Railway Station. Several thousand sailorswere massed there, bristling with rifles.Standing on the steps, a member of the _Vikzhel_ was pleading withthem."Comrades, we cannot carry you to Moscow. We are neutral. We do notcarry troops for either side. We cannot take you to Moscow, wherealready there is terrible civil war...."All the seething Square roared at him; the sailors began to surgeforward. Suddenly another door was flung wide; in it stood two orthree brakeman, a fireman or so."This way, comrades!" cried one. "We will take you to Moscow-orVladivostok, if you like! Long live the Revolution!"                              Chapter IX                               Victory_Order Number I_To the Troops of the Pulkovo Detachment.November 13, 1917. 38 minutes past 9 a. m.After a cruel fight the troops of the Pulkovo detachment completelyrouted the counter-revolutionary forces, who retreated from theirpositions in disorder, and under cover of Tsarskoye Selo fell backtoward Pavlovsk II and Gatchina.Our advanced units occupied the northeastern extremity of TsarskoyeSelo and the station Alexandrovskaya. The Colpinno detachment was onour left, the Krasnoye Selo detachment to our right.I ordered the Pulkovo forces to occupy Tsarskoye Selo, to fortifyits approaches, especially on the side of Gatchina.Also to pass and occupy Pavlovskoye, fortifying its southern side,and to take up the railroad as far as Dno.The troops must take all measures to strengthen the positionsoccupied by them, arranging trenches and other defensive works.They must enter into close liaison with the detachments of Colpinnoand Krasnoye Selo, and also with the Staff of the Commander in Chieffor the Defence of Petrograd.Signed,_Commander in Chief aver all Forces acting against theCounter-revolutionary Troops of Kerensky,_Lieutenant-Colonel MURAVIOV.Tuesday morning. But how is this? Only two days ago the Petrogradcampagna was full of leaderless bands, wandering aimlessly; withoutfood, without artillery, without a plan. What had fused thatdisorganised mass of undisciplined Red Guards, and soldiers withoutofficers, into an army obedient to its own elected high command,tempered to meet and break the assault of cannon and Cossackcavalry? (See App. IX, Sect. 1)People in revolt have a way of defying military precedent. Theragged armies of the French Revolution are not forgotten-Valmy andthe Lines of Weissembourg. Massed against the Soviet forces were_yunkers,_ Cossacks, land-owners, nobility, Black Hundreds-the Tsarcome again, _Okhrana_ and Siberian chains; and the vast and terriblemenace of the Germans.... Victory, in the words of Carlyle, meant"Apotheosis and Millennium without end!"Sunday night, the Commissars of the Military Revolutionary Committeereturning desperately from the field, the garrison of Petrogradelected its Committee of Five, its Battle Staff, three soldiers andtwo officers, all certified free from counter-revolutionary taint.Colonel Muraviov, ex-patriot, was in command-an efficient man, butto be carefully watched. At Colpinno, at Obukhovo, at Pulkovo andKrasnoye Selo were formed provisional detachments, increased in sizeas the stragglers came in from the surrounding country-mixedsoldiers, sailors and Red Guards, parts of regiments, infantry,cavalry and artillery all together, and a few armoured cars.Day broke, and the pickets of Kerensky's Cossacks came in touch.Scattered rifle-fire, summons to surrender. Over the bleak plain onthe cold quiet air spread the sound of battle, falling upon the earsof roving bands as they gathered about their little fires, waiting....So it was beginning! They made toward the battle; and the workerhordes pouring out along the straight roads quickened their pace....Thus upon all the points of attack automatically converged angryhuman swarms, to be met by Commissars and assigned positions, orwork to do. This was _their_ battle, for _their_ world; the officersin command were elected by _them._ For the moment that incoherentmultiple will was one will....Those who participated in the fighting described to me how thesailors fought until they ran out of cartridges, and then stormed;how the untrained workmen rushed the charging Cossacks and tore themfrom their horses; how the anonymous hordes of the people, gatheringin the darkness around the battle, rose like a tide and poured overthe enemy.... Before midnight of Monday the Cossacks broke and werefleeing, leaving their artillery behind them, and the army of theproletariat, on a long ragged front, moved forward and rolled intoTsarskoye, before the enemy had a chance to destroy the greatGovernment wireless station, from which now the Commissars of Smolnywere hurling out to the world paeans of triumph....TO ALL SOVIETS OF WORKERS' AND SOLDIERS' DEPUTIESThe 12th of November, in a bloody combat near Tsarskoye Selo, therevolutionary army defeated the counter-revolutionary troops ofKerensky and Kornilov. In the name of the Revolutionary Government Iorder all regiments to take the offensive against the enemies of therevolutionary democracy, and to take all measures to arrestKerensky, and also to oppose any adventure which might menace theconquests of the Revolution and the victory of the proletariat.Long live the Revolutionary Army!MURAVIOV.News from the provinces....At Sevastopol the local Soviet had assumed the power; a huge meetingof the sailors on the battleships in the harbour had forced theirofficers to line up and swear allegiance to the new Government. AtNizhni Novgorod the Soviet was in control. From Kazan came reportsof a battle in the streets, _yunkers_ and a brigade of artilleryagainst the Bolshevik garrison....Desperate fighting had broken out again in Moscow. The _yunkers_ andWhite Guards held the Kremlin and the centre of the town, beatenupon from all sides by the troops of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. The Soviet artillery was stationed in Skobeliev Square,bombarding the City Duma building, the Prefecture and the HotelMetropole. The cobblestones of the Tverskaya and Nikitskaya had beentorn up for trenches and barricades. A hail of machine-gun fireswept the quarters of the great banks and commercial houses. Therewere no lights, no telephones; the bourgeois population lived in thecellars.... The last bulletin said that the Military RevolutionaryCommittee had delivered an ultimatum to the Committee of PublicSafety, demanding the immediate surrender of the Kremlin, orbombardment would follow."Bombard the Kremlin?" cried the ordinary citizen. "They dare not!"From Vologda to Chita in far Siberia, from Pskov to Sevastopol onthe Black Sea, in great cities and little villages, civil war burstinto flame. From thousands of factories, peasant communes, regimentsand armies, ships on the wide sea, greetings poured intoPetrograd-greetings to the Government of the People.The Cossack Government at Novotcherkask telegraphed to Kerensky,_"The Government of the Cossack troops invites the ProvisionalGovernment and the members of the Council of the Republic to come,if possible, to Novotcherkask, where we can organise in common thestruggle against the Bolsheviki."_In Finland, also, things were stirring. The Soviet of Helsingforsand the _Tsentrobalt_ (Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet),jointly proclaimed a state of siege, and declared that all attemptsto interfere with the Bolshevik forces, and all armed resistance toits orders, would be severely repressed. At the same time theFinnish Railway Union called a countrywide general strike, to putinto operation the laws passed by the Socialist Diet of June, 1917,dissolved by Kerensky....Early in the morning I went out to Smolny. Going up the long woodensidewalk from the outer gate I saw the first thin, hesitatingsnow-flakes fluttering down from the grey, windless sky. "Snow!"cried the soldier at the door, grinning with delight. "Good for thehealth!" Inside, the long, gloomy halls and bleak rooms seemeddeserted. No one moved in all the enormous pile. A deep, uneasysound came to my ears, and looking around, I noticed that everywhereon the floor, along the walls, men were sleeping. Rough, dirty men,workers and soldiers, spattered and caked with mud, sprawled aloneor in heaps, in the careless attitudes of death. Some wore raggedbandages marked with blood. Guns and cartridge-belts were scatteredabout.... The victorious proletarian army!In the upstairs buffet so thick they lay that one could hardly walk.The air was foul. Through the clouded windows a pale light streamed.A battered samovar, cold, stood on the counter, and many glassesholding dregs of tea. Beside them lay a copy of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee's last bulletin, upside down, scrawled withpainful hand-writing. It was a memorial written by some soldier tohis comrades fallen in the fight against Kerensky, just as he hadset it down before falling on the floor to sleep. The writing wasblurred with what looked like tears....Alexei VinogradovD. MaskvinS. StolbikovA. VoskressenskyD. LeonskyD. PreobrazhenskyV. LaidanskyM.

Under the earth of the grave__You have straitly closed your ranks. Sleep, Citizens!_Only the Military Revolutionary Committee still functioned,unsleeping. Skripnik, emerging from the inner room, said that Gotzhad been arrested, but had flatly denied signing the proclamation ofthe Committee for Salvation, as had Avksentiev; and the Committeefor Salvation itself had repudiated the Appeal to the garrison.There was still disafiection among the city regiments, Skripnikreported; the Volhynsky Regiment had refused to fight againstKerensky.Several detachments of "neutral" troops, with Tchernov at theirhead, were at Gatchina, trying to persuade Kerensky to halt hisattack on Petrograd.Skripnik laughed. "There can be no 'neutrals' now," he said. "We'vewon!" His sharp, bearded face glowed with an almost religiousexaltation. "More than sixty delegates have arrived from the Front,with assurances of support by all the armies except the troops onthe Rumanian front, who have not been heard from. The ArmyCommittees have suppressed all news from Petrograd, but we now havea regular system of couriers...."[Graphic page-224 Certificate approving telegram transmission]Order given me at Staff headquarters by command of the Council ofPeople's Commissars, to transmit the first despatch out of Perogradafter the November Revolution, over the Government wires to America.

For the Commander in Chief, ANTONOV                      Chief of Staff, VLAD. BONCH-BRUEVITCHDown in the front hall Kameniev was just entering, worn out by theall-night session of the Conference to Form a New Government, buthappy. "Already the Socialist Revolutionaries are inclined to admitus into the new Government," he told me. "The right wing groups arefrightened by the Revolutionary Tribunals; they demand, in a sort ofpanic, that we dissolve them before going any further. ... We haveaccepted the proposition of the _Vikzhel_ to form a homogeneousSocialist Ministry, and they're working on that now. You see, it allsprings from our victory. When we were down, they would't have us atany price; not everybody's in favour of some agreement with theSoivets.... What we need is a really decisive victory. Kerensky wantsan armistice, but he'll have to surrender (See App. IX, Sect. 2) ...."That was the temper of the Bolshevik leaders. To a foreignjournalist who asked Trotzky what statement he had to make to theworld, Trotzky replied: "At this moment the only statement possibleis the one we are making through the mouths of our cannon!"But there was an undercurrent of real anxiety in the tide ofvictory; the question of finances. Instead of opening the banks, ashad been ordered by the Military Revolutionary Committee, the Unionof Bank Employees had held a meeting and declared a formal strike.Smolny had demanded some thirty-five millions of rubles from theState Bank, and the cashier had locked the vaults, only paying outmoney to the representatives of the Provisional Government. Thereactionaries were using the State Bank as a political weapon; forinstance, when the _Vikzhel_ demanded money to pay the salaries ofthe employees of the Government railroads, it was told to apply toSmolny....I went to the State Bank to see the new Commissar, a redhairedUkrainean Bolshevik named Petrovitch. He was trying to bring orderout of the chaos in which affairs had been left by the strikingclerks. In all the offices of the huge place perspiring volunteerworkers, soldiers and sailors, their tongues sticking out of theirmouths in the intensity of their effort, were poring over the greatledgers with a bewildered air....The Duma building was crowded. There were still isolated cases ofdefiance toward the new Government, but they were rare. The CentralLand Committee had appealed to the Peasants, ordering them not torecognise the Land Decree passed by the Congress of the Soviets,because it would cause confusion and civil war. Mayor Schreiderannounced that because of the Bolshevik insurrection, the electionsto the Constituent Assembly would have to be indefinitely postponed.Two questions seemed to be uppermost in all minds, shocked by theferocity of the civil war; first, a truce to the bloodshed (See App.IX, Sect. 3)-second, the creation of a new Government. There was nolonger any talk of "destroying the Bolsheviki"-and very little aboutexcluding them from the Government, except from the PopulistSocialists and the Peasants' Soviets. Even the Central ArmyCommittee at the _Stavka,_ the most determined enemy of Smolny,telephoned from Moghilev: "If, to constitute the new Ministry, it isnecessary to come to an understanding with the Bolsheviki, we agreeto admit them _in a minority_ to the Cabinet."_Pravda,_ ironically calling attention to Kerensky's "humanitariansentiments," published his despatch to the Committee for Salvation:In accord with the proposals of the Committee for Salvation and allthe democratic organisations united around it, I have halted allmilitary action against the rebels. A delegate of the Committee hasbeen sent to enter into negotiations. Take all measures to stop theuseless shedding of blood.The _Vikzhel_ sent a telegram to all Russia:The Conference of the Union of Railway Workers with therepresentatives of both the belligerent parties, who admit thenecessity of an agreement, protest energetically against the use ofpolitical terrorism in the civil war, especially when it is carriedon between different factions of the revolutionary democracy, anddeclare that political terrorism, in whatever form, is incontradiction to the very idea of the negotiations for a newGovernment....[Graphic page-227 Leaflet ]Popular leaflet sold in the streets just after the Bolshevikinsurrection, containing rhymes and jokes about the defeatedbourgeoisie and the "moderate" Socialist leaders, Called, "How THEBOORZHUI (BOURGEOISIE) LOST THE POWER."Delegations from the Conference were sent to the Front, to Gatchina.In the Conference itself everything seemed on the point of finalsettlement. It had even been decided to elect a Provisional People'sCouncil, composed of about four hundred members-seventy-fiverepresenting Smolny, seventy-five the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and therest split up among the Town Dumas, the Trade Unions, LandCommittees and political parties. Tchernov was mentioned as the newPremier. Lenin and Trotzky, rumour said, were to be excluded....About noon I was again in front of Smolny, talking with the driverof an ambulance bound for the revolutionary front. Could I go withhim? Certainly! He was a volunteer, a University student, and as werolled down the street shouted over his shoulder to me phrases ofexecrable German: _"Also, gut! Wir nach die Kasernen zu essengehen!"_ I made out that there would be lunch at some barracks.On the Kirotchnaya we turned into an immense courtyard surrounded bymilitary buildings, and mounted a dark stairway to a low room lit byone window. At a long wooden table were seated some twenty soldiers,eating _shtchi_ (cabbage soup) from a great tin wash-tub with woodenspoons, and talking loudly with much laughter."Welcome to the Battalion Committee of the Sixth Reserve Engineers'Battalion!" cried my friend, and introduced me as an AmericanSocialist. Whereat every one rose to shake my hand, and one oldsoldier put his arms around me and gave me a hearty kiss. A woodenspoon was produced and I took my place at the table. Another tub,full of _kasha,_ was brought in, a huge loaf of black bread, and ofcourse the inevitable tea-pots. At once every one began asking mequestions about America: Was it true that people in a free countrysold their votes for _money?_ If so, how did they get what theywanted? How about this "Tammany"? Was it true that in a free countrya little group of people could control a whole city, and exploitedit for their personal benefit? Why did the people stand it? Evenunder the Tsar such things could not happen in Russia; true, herethere was always graft, but to buy and sell a whole city full ofpeople! And in a free country! Had the people no revolutionaryfeeling? I tried to explain that in my country people tried tochange things by law."Of course," nodded a young sergeant, named Baklanov, who spokeFrench. "But you have a highly developed capitalist class? Then thecapitalist class must control the legislatures and the courts. Howthen can the people change things? I am open to conviction, for I donot know your country; but to me it is incredible...."I said that I was going to Tsarskoye Selo. "I, too," said Baklanov,suddenly. "And I-and I-" The whole roomful decided on the spot to goto Tsarskoye Selo.Just then came a knock on the door. It opened, and in it stood thefigure of the Colonel. No one rose, but all shouted a greeting. "MayI come in?" asked the Colonel. "_Prosim! Prosim!_" they answeredheartily. He entered, smiling, a tall, distinguished figure in agoat-skin cape embroidered with gold. "I think I heard you say thatyou were going to Tsarskoye Selo, comrades," he said. "Could I gowith you?"Baklanov considered. "I do not think there is anything to be donehere to-day," he answered. "Yes, comrade, we shall be very glad tohave you." The Colonel thanked him and sat down, filling a glass oftea.In a low voice, for fear of wounding the Colonel's pride, Baklanovexplained to me. "You see, I am the chairman of the Committee. Wecontrol the Battalion absolutely, except in action, when the Colonelis delegated by us to command. In action his orders must be obeyed,but he is strictly responsible to us. In barracks he must ask ourpermission before taking any action.... You might call him ourExecutive Officer...."Arms were distributed to us, revolvers and rifles-"we might meetsome Cossacks, you know"-and we all piled into the ambulance,together with three great bundles of newspapers for the front.Straight down the Liteiny we rattled, and along the ZagorodnyProspekt. Next to me sat a youth with the shoulder-straps of aLieutenant, who seemed to speak all European languages with equalfluency. He was a member of the Battalion Committee."I am not a Bolshevik," he assured me, emphatically. "My family is avery ancient and noble one. I, myself, am, you might say, a Cadet....""But how--?" I began, bewildered."Oh, yes, I am a member of the Committee. I make no secret of mypolitical opinions, but the others do not mind, because they know Ido not believe in opposing the will of the majority.... I have refusedto take any action in the present civil war, however, for I do notbelieve in taking up arms against my brother Russians....""Provocator! Kornilovitz!" the others cried at him gaily, slappinghim on the shoulder....Passing under the huge grey stone archway of the Moskovsky Gate,covered with golden hieroglyphics, ponderous Imperial eagles and thenames of Tsars, we sped out on the wide straight highway, grey withthe first light fall of snow. It was thronged with Red Guards,stumbling along on foot toward the revolutionary front, shouting andsinging; and others, greyfaced and muddy, coming back. Most of themseemed to be mere boys. Women with spades, some with rifles andbandoleers, others wearing the Red Cross on their arm-bands-thebowed, toil-worm women of the slums. Squads of soldiers marching outof step, with an affectionate jeer for the Red Guards; sailors,grim-looking; children with bundles of food for their fathers andmothers; all these, coming and going, trudged through the whitenedmud that covered the cobbles of the highway inches deep. We passedcannon, jingling southward with their caissons; trucks bound bothways, bristling with armed men; ambulances full of wounded from thedirection of the battle, and once a peasant cart, creaking slowlyalong, in which sat a white-faced boy bent over his shatteredstomach and screaming monotonously. In the fields on either sidewomen and old men were digging trenches and stringing barbed wireentanglements.Back northward the clouds rolled away dramatically, and the pale suncame out. Across the flat, marshy plain Petrograd glittered. To theright, white and gilded and coloured bulbs and pinnacles; to theleft, tall chimneys, some pouring out black smoke; and beyond, alowering sky over Finland. On each side of us were churches,monasteries.... Occasionally a monk was visible, silently watching thepulse of the proletarian army throbbing on the road.At Pulkovo the road divided, and there we halted in the midst of agreat crowd, where the human streams poured from three directions,friends meeting, excited and congratulatory, describing the battleto one another. A row of houses facing the cross-roads was markedwith bullets, and the earth was trampled into mud half a milearound. The fighting had been furious here.... In the near distanceriderless Cossack horses circled hungrily, for the grass of theplain had died long ago. Right in front of us an awkward Red Guardwas trying to ride one, falling off again and again, to thechildlike delight of a thousand rough men.The left road, along which the remnants of the Cossacks hadretreated, led up a little hill to a hamlet, where there was aglorious view of the immense plain, grey as a windless sea,tumultuous clouds towering over, and the imperial city disgorgingits thousands along all the roads. Far over to the left lay thelittle hill of Kranoye Selo, the parade-ground of the ImperialGuards' summer camp, and the Imperial Dairy. In the middle distancenothing broke the flat monotony but a few walled monasteries andconvents, some isolated factories, and several large buildings withunkempt grounds that were asylums and orphanages...."Here," said the driver, as we went on over a barren hill, "here waswhere Vera Slutskaya died. Yes, the Bolshevik member of the Duma. Ithappened early this morning. She was in an automobile, with Zalkindand another man. There was a truce, and they started for the fronttrenches. They were talking and laughing, when all of a sudden, fromthe armoured train in which Kerensky himself was riding, somebodysaw the automobile and fired a cannon. The shell struck VeraSlutskaya and killed her...."And so we came into Tsarskoye, all bustling with the swaggeringheroes of the proletarian horde. Now the palace where the Soviet hadmet was a busy place. Red Guards and sailors filled the court-yard,sentries stood at the doors, and a stream of couriers and Commissarspushed in and out. In the Soviet room a samovar had been set up, andfifty or more workers, soldiers, sailors and officers stood around,drinking tea and talking at the top of their voices. In one cornertwo clumsy-handed workingmen were trying to make a multigraphingmachine go. At the centre table, the huge Dybenko bent over a map,marking out positions for the troops with red and blue pencils. Inhis free hand he carried, as always, the enormous bluesteelrevolver. Anon he sat himself down at a typewriter and pounded awaywith one finger; every little while he would pause, pick up therevolver, and lovingly spin the chamber.A couch lay along the wall, and on this was stretched a youngworkman. Two Red Guards were bending over him, but the rest of thecompany did not pay any attention. In his breast was a hole; throughhis clothes fresh blood came welling up with every heart-beat. Hiseyes were closed and his young, bearded face was greenish-white.Faintly and slowly he still breathed, with every breath sighing,_"Mir boudit! Mir boudit!_ (Peace is coming! Peace is coming!)"Dybenko looked up as we came in. "Ah," he said to Baklanov."Comrade, will you go up to the Commandant's headquarters and takecharge? Wait; I will write you credentials." He went to thetypewriter and slowly picked out the letters.The new Commandant of Tsarskoye Selo and I went toward the EkaterinaPalace, Baklanov very excited and important. In the same ornate,white room some Red Guards were rummaging curiously around, while myold friend, the Colonel, stood by the window biting his moustache.He greeted me like a long-lost brother. At a table near the door satthe French Bessarabian. The Bolsheviki had ordered him to remain,and continue his work."What could I do?" he muttered. "People like myself cannot fight oneither side in such a war as this, no matter how much we mayinstinctively dislike the dictatorship of the mob.... I only regretthat I am so far from my mother in Bessarabia!"Baklanov was formally taking over the office from the Commandant."Here," said the Colonel nervously, "are the keys to the desk."A Red Guard interrupted. "Where's the money?" he asked rudely. TheColonel seemed surprised. "Money? Money? Ah, you mean the chest.There it is," said the Colonel, "just as I found it when I tookpossession three days ago. Keys?" The Colonel shrugged. "I have nokeys."The Red Guard sneered knowingly. "Very convenient," he said."Let us open the chest," said Baklanov. "Bring an axe. Here is anAmerican comrade. Let him smash the chest open, and write down whathe finds there."I swung the axe. The wooden chest was empty."Let's arrest him," said the Red Guard, venomously. "He isKerensky's man. He has stolen the money and given it to Kerensky."Baklanov did not want to. "Oh, no," he said. "It was the Kornilovitzbefore him. He is not to blame."The devil!" cried the Red Guard. "He is Kerensky's man, I tell you.If _you_ won't arrest him, then _we_ will, and we'll take him toPetrograd and put him in Peter-Paul, where he belongs!" At this theother Red Guards growled assent. With a piteous glance at us theColonel was led away....Down in front of the Soviet palace an auto-truck was going to thefront. Half a dozen Red Guards, some sailors, and a soldier or two,under command of a huge workman, clambered in, and shouted to me tocome along. Red Guards issued from headquarters, each of themstaggering under an arm-load of small, corrugated-iron bombs, filledwith _grubit_-which, they say, is ten times as strong, and fivetimes as sensitive as dynamite; these they threw into the truck. Athree-inch cannon was loaded and then tied onto the tail of thetruck with bits of rope and wire.We started with a shout, at top speed of course; the heavy truckswaying from side to side. The cannon leaped from one wheel to theother, and the _grubit_ bombs went rolling back and forth over ourfeet, fetching up against the sides of the car with a crash.The big Red Guard, whose name was Vladimir Nicolaievitch, plied mewith questions about America. "Why did America come into the war?Are the American workers ready to throw over the capitalists? Whatis the situation in the Mooney case now? Will they extradite Berkmanto San Francisco?" and other, very difficult to answer, alldelivered in a shout above the roaring of the truck, while we heldon to each other and danced amid the caroming bombs.Occasionally a patrol tried to stop us. Soldiers ran out into theroad before us, shouted _"Shtoi!"_ and threw up their guns.We paid no attention. "The devil take you!" cried the Red Guards."We don't stop for anybody! We're Red Guards!" And we thunderedimperiously on, while Vladimir Nicolaievitch bellowed to me aboutthe internationalisation of the Panama Canal, and such matters....About five miles out we saw a squad of sailors marching back, andslowed down."Where's the front, brothers?"The foremost sailor halted and scratched his head. "This morning,"he said, "it was about half a kilometer down the road. But the damnthing isn't anywhere now. We walked and walked and walked, but wecouldn't find it."They climbed into the truck, and we proceeded. It must have beenabout a mile further that Vladimir Nicolaievitch cocked his ear andshouted to the chauffeur to stop."Firing!" he said. "Do you hear it?" For a moment dead silence, andthen, a little ahead and to the left, three shots in rapidsuccession. Along here the side of the road was heavily wooded. Verymuch excited now, we crept along, speaking in whispers, until thetruck was nearly opposite the place where the firing had come from.Descending, we spread out, and every man carrying his rifle, wentstealthily into the forest.Two comrades, meanwhile, detached the cannon and slewed it arounduntil it aimed as nearly as possible at our backs.It was silent in the woods. The leaves were gone, and thetree-trunks were a pale wan colour in the low, sickly autumn sun.Not a thing moved, except the ice of little woodland pools shiveringunder our feet. Was it an ambush?We went uneventfully forward until the trees began to thin, andpaused. Beyond, in a little clearing, three soldiers sat around asmall fire, perfectly oblivious.Vladimir Nicolaievitch stepped forward. _"Zra'zvuitye,_ comrades!"he greeted, while behind him one cannon, twenty rifles and atruck-load of _grubit_ bombs hung by a hair. The soldiers scrambledto their feet."What was the shooting going on around here?"One of the soldiers answered, looking relieved, "Why we were justshooting a rabbit or two, comrade...."The truck hurtled on toward Romanov, through the bright, empty day.At the first cross-roads two soldiers ran out in front of us, wavingtheir rifles. We slowed down, and stopped."Passes, comrades!"The Red Guards raised a great clamour. "We are Red Guards. We don'tneed any passes.... Go on, never mind them!"But a sailor objected. "This is wrong, comrades. We must haverevolutionary discipline. Suppose some counterrevolutionaries camealong in a truck and said: 'We don't need any passes?' The comradesdon't know you."At this there was a debate. One by one, however, the sailors andsoldiers joined with the first. Grumbling, each Red Guard producedhis dirty _bumaga_ (paper). All were alike except mine, which hadbeen issued by the Revolutionary Staff at Smolny. The sentriesdeclared that I must go with them. The Red Guards objectedstrenuously, but the sailor who had spoken first insisted. "Thiscomrade we know to be a true comrade," he said. "But there areorders of the Committee, and these orders must be obeyed. That isrevolutionary discipline...."In order not to make any trouble, I got down from the truck, andwatched it disappear careening down the road, all the company wavingfarewell. The soldiers consulted in low tones for a moment, and thenled me to a wall, against which they placed me. It flashed upon mesuddenly; they were going to shoot me!In all three directions not a human being was in sight. The onlysign of life was smoke from the chimney of a _datchya,_ a ramblingwooden house a quarter of a mile up the side road. The two soldierswere walking out into the road. Desperately I ran after them."But comrades! See! Here is the seal of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee!"They stared stupidly at my pass, then at each other."It is different from the others," said one, sullenly. "We cannotread, brother."I took him by the arm. "Come!" I said. "Let's go to that house. Someone there can surely read." They hesitated. "No," said one. Theother looked me over. "Why not?" he muttered. "After all, it is aserious crime to kill an innocent man."We walked up to the front door of the house and knocked. A short,stout woman opened it, and shrank back in alarm, babbling, "I don'tknow anything about them! I don't know anything about them!" One ofmy guards held out the pass. She screamed. "Just to read it,comrade." Hesitatingly she took the paper and read aloud, swiftly:The bearer of this pass, John Reed, is a representative of theAmerican Social-Democracy, an internationalist....Out on the road again the two soldiers held another consultation."We must take you to the Regimental Committee," they said. In thefast-deepening twilight we trudged along the muddy road.Occasionally we met squads of soldiers, who stopped and surroundedme with looks of menace, handling my pass around and arguingviolently as to whether or not I should be killed....It was dark when we came to the barracks of the Second TsarskoyeSelo Rifles, low sprawling buildings huddled along the post-road. Anumber of soldiers slouching at the entrance asked eager questions.A spy? A provocator? We mounted a winding stair and emerged into agreat, bare room with a huge stove in the centre, and rows of cotson the floor, where about a thousand soldiers were playing cards,talking, singing, and asleep. In the roof was a jagged hole made byKerensky's cannon....I stood in the doorway, and a sudden silence ran among the groups,who turned and stared at me. Of a sudden they began to move, slowlyand then with a rush, thundering, with faces full of hate."Comrades! Comrades!" yelled one of my guards. "Committee!Committee!" The throng halted, banked around me, muttering. Out ofthem shouldered a lean youth, wearing a red arm-band."Who is this?" he asked roughly. The guards explained. "Give me thepaper!" He read it carefully, glancing at me with keen eyes. Then hesmiled and handed me the pass. "Comrades, this is an Americancomrade. I am Chairman of the Committee, and I welcome you to theRegiment...." A sudden general buzz grew into a roar of greeting, andthey pressed forward to shake my hand."You have not dined? Here we have had our dinner. You shall go tothe Officers' Club, where there are some who speak your language...."He led me across the court-yard to the door of another building. Anaristocratic-looking youth, with the shoulder straps of aLieutenant, was entering. The Chairman presented me, and shakinghands, went back."I am Stepan Georgevitch Morovsky, at your service," said theLieutenant, in perfect French. From the ornate entrance hall aceremonial staircase led upward, lighted by glittering lustres. Onthe second floor billiard-rooms, card-rooms, a library opened fromthe hall. We entered the dining-room, at a long table in the centreof which sat about twenty officers in full uniform, wearing theirgold- and silver-handled swords, the ribbons and crosses of Imperialdecorations. All rose politely as I entered, and made a place for mebeside the Colonel, a large, impressive man with a grizzled beard.Orderlies were deftly serving dinner. The atmosphere was that of anyofficers' mess in Europe. Where was the Revolution?"You are not Bolsheviki?" I asked Morovsky.A smile went around the table, but I caught one or two glancingfurtively at the orderly."No," answered my friend. "There is only one Bolshevik officer inthis regiment. He is in Petrograd to-night. The Colonel is aMenshevik. Captain Kherlov there is a Cadet. I myself am a SocialistRevolutionary of the right wing.... I should say that most of theofficers in the Army are not Bolsheviki, but like me they believe indemocracy; they believe that they must follow the soldier-masses...."Dinner over, maps were brought, and the Colonel spread them out onthe table. The rest crowded around to see."Here," said the Colonel, pointing to pencil marks, "were ourpositions this morning. Vladimir Kyrilovitch, where is your company?"Captain Kherlov pointed. "According to orders, we occupied theposition along this road. Karsavin relieved me at five o'clock."Just then the door of the room opened, and there entered theChairman of the Regimental Committee, with another soldier. Theyjoined the group behind the Colonel, peering at the map.              map.              |          |"Good," said the Colonel. "Now the Cossacks have fallen back tenkilometres in our sector. I do not think it is necessary to take upadvanced positions. Gentlemen, for to-night you will hold thepresent line, strengthening the positions by--""If you please," interrupted the Chairman of the RegimentalCommittee. "The orders are to advance with all speed, and prepare toengage the Cossacks north of Gatchina in the morning. A crushingdefeat is necessary. Kindly make the proper dispositions."There was a short silence. The Colonel again turned to the map."Very well," he said, in a different voice. "Stepan Georgevitch, youwill please--" Rapidly tracing lines with a blue pencil, he gave hisorders, while a sergeant made shorthand notes. The sergeant thenwithdrew, and ten minutes later returned with the orderstypewritten, and one carbon copy. The Chairman of the Committeestudied the map with a copy of the orders before him."All right," he said, rising. Folding the carbon copy, he put it inhis pocket. Then he signed the other, stamped it with a round sealtaken from his pocket, and presented it to the Colonel....Here was the Revolution!I returned to the Soviet palace in Tsarskoye in the Regimental Staffautomobile. Still the crowds of workers, soldiers and sailorspouring in and out, still the choking press of trucks, armouredcars, cannon before the door, and the shouting, the laughter ofunwonted victory. Half a dozen Red Guards forced their way through,a priest in the middle. This was Father Ivan, they said, who hadblessed the Cossacks when they entered the town. I heard afterwardthat he was shot.... (See App. IX, Sect. 4)Dybenko was just coming out, giving rapid orders right and left. Inhis hand he carried the big revolver. An automobile stood withracing engine at the kerb. Alone, he climbed in the rear seat, andwas off-off to Gatchina, to conquer Kerensky.Toward nightfall he arrived at the outskirts of the town, and wenton afoot. What Dybenko told the Cossacks nobody knows, but the factis that General Krasnov and his staff and several thousand Cossackssurrendered, and advised Kerensky to do the same. (See App. IX,Sect. 5)As for Kerensky-I reprint here the deposition made by GeneralKrasnov on the morning of November 14th:"Gatchina, November 14, 1917. To-day, about three o'clock (A. M.), Iwas summoned by the Supreme Commander (Kerensky). He was veryagitated, and very nervous."'General,' he said to me, 'you have betrayed me. Your Cossacksdeclare categorically that they will arrest me and deliver me to thesailors.'"'Yes,' I answered, 'there is talk of it, and I know that you haveno sympathy anywhere.'"'But the officers say the same thing.'"'Yes, most of all it is the officers who are discontented with you.'"'What shall I do? I ought to commit suicide!'"'If you are an honorable man, you will go immediately to Petrogradwith a white flag, you will present yourself to the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee, and enter into negotiations as Chief of theProvisional Government.'"'All right. I will do that, General.'"'I will give you a guard and ask that a sailor go with you.'"'No, no, not a sailor. Do you know whether it is true that Dybenkois here?'"'I don't know who Dybenko is.'"'He is my enemy."'There is nothing to do. If you play for high stakes you must knowhow to take a chance.'"'Yes. I'll leave to-night!'"'Why? That would be a flight. Leave calmly and openly, so thatevery one can see that you are not running away.'"'Very well. But you must give me a guard on which I can count.'"'Good.'"I went out and called the Cossack Russkov, of the Tenth Regiment ofthe Don, and ordered him to pick out ten Cossacks to accompany theSupreme Commander. Half an hour later the Cossacks came to tell methat Kerensky was not in his quarters, that he had run away."I gave the alarm and ordered that he be searched for, supposingthat he could not have left Gatchina, but he could not be found...."And so Kerensky fled, alone, "disguised in the uniform of a sailor,"and by that act lost whatever popularity he had retained among theRussian masses....I went back to Petrograd riding on the front seat of an auto truck,driven by a workman and filled with Red Guards. We had no kerosene,so our lights were not burning. The road was crowded with theproletarian army going home, and new reserves pouring out to taketheir places. Immense trucks like ours, columns of artillery,wagons, loomed up in the night, without lights, as we were. Wehurtled furiously on, wrenched right and left to avoid collisionsthat seemed inevitable, scraping wheels, followed by the epithets ofpedestrians.Across the horizon spread the glittering lights of the capital,immeasurably more splendid by night than by day, like a dike ofjewels heaped on the barren plain.The old workman who drove held the wheel in one hand, while with theother he swept the far-gleaming capital in an exultant gesture."Mine!" he cried, his face all alight. "All mine now! My Petrograd!"                              Chapter X                                MoscowThe Military Revolutionary Committee, with a fierce intensity,followed up its victory:November 14th.To all Army, corps, divisional and regimental Committees, to allSoviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, to all, all,all.Conforming to the agreement between the Cossacks, _yunkers,_soldiers, sailors and workers, it has been decided to arraignAlexander Feodorvitch Kerensky before a tribunal of the people. Wedemand that Kerensky be arrested, and that he be ordered, in the nameof the organisations hereinafter mentioned, to come immediately toPetrograd and present himself to the tribunal.Signed,_The Cossacks of the First Division of Ussuri Cavalry; the Committeeof Yunkers of the Petrograd detachment of Franc-Tireurs; the delegateof the Fifth Army._People's Commissar DYBENKO.The Committee for Salvation, the Duma, the Central Committee of theSocialist Revolutionary party-proudly claiming Kerensky as amember-all passionately protested that he could only be heldresponsible to the Constituent Assembly.On the evening of November 16th I watched two thousand Red Guardsswing down the Zagorodny Prospekt behind a military band playing the_Marseillaise_-and how appropriate it sounded-with blood-red flagsover the dark ranks of workmen, to welcome home again their brotherswho had defended "Red Petrograd." In the bitter dusk they tramped,men and women, their tall bayonets swaying; through streets faintlylighted and slippery with mud, between silent crowds of bourgeois,contemptuous but fearful....All were against them-business men, speculators, investors,land-owners, army officers, politicians, teachers, students,professional men, shop-keepers, clerks, agents. The other Socialistparties hated the Bolsheviki with an implacable hatred. On the sideof the Soviets were the rank and file of the workers, the sailors,all the undemoralised soldiers, the landless peasants, and a few-avery few-intellectuals....From the farthest corners of great Russia, whereupon desperatestreet-fighting burst like a wave, news of Kerensky's defeat cameechoing back the immense roar of proletarian victory. Kazan, Saratov,Novgorod, Vinnitza-where the streets had run with blood; Moscow,where the Bolsheviki had turned their artillery against the laststrong-hold of the bourgeoisie-the Kremlin."They are bombarding the Kremlin!" The news passed from mouth tomouth in the streets of Petrograd, almost with a sense of terror.Travellers from "white and shining little mother Moscow" told fearfultales. Thousands killed; the Tverskaya and the Kuznetsky Most inflames; the church of Vasili Blazheiny a smoking ruin; UsspenskyCathedral crumbling down; the Spasskaya Gate of the Kremlintottering; the Duma burned to the ground. (See App. X, Sect. 1)Nothing that the Bolsheviki had done could compare with this fearfulblasphemy in the heart of Holy Russia. To the ears of the devoutsounded the shock of guns crashing in the face of the Holy OrthodoxChurch, and pounding to dust the sanctuary of the Russian nation....On November 15th, Lunatcharsky, Commissar of Education, broke intotears at the session of the Council of People's Commissars, andrushed from the room, crying, "I cannot stand it! I cannot bear themonstrous destruction of beauty and tradition...."That afternoon his letter of resignation was published in thenewspapers:I have just been informed, by people arriving from Moscow, what hashappened there.The Cathedral of St. Basil the Blessed, the Cathedral of theAssumption, are being bombarded. The Kremlin, where are now gatheredthe most important art treasures of Petrograd and of Moscow, is underartillery fire. There are thousands of victims.The fearful struggle there has reached a pitch of bestial ferocity.What is left? What more can happen?I cannot bear this. My cup is full. I am unable to endure thesehorrors. It is impossible to work under the pressure of thoughtswhich drive me mad!That is why I am leaving the Council of People's Commissars.I fully realise the gravity of this decision. But I can bear nomore.... (See App. X, Sect. 2)That same day the White Guards and _yunkers_ in the Kremlinsurrendered, and were allowed to march out unharmed. The treaty ofpeace follows:1. The Committee of Public Safety ceases to exist.2. The White Guard gives up its arms and dissolves. The officersretain their swords and regulations side-arms. In the MilitarySchools are retained only the arms necessary for instruction; allothers are surrendered by the _yunkers._ The Military RevolutionaryCommittee guarantees the liberty and inviolability of the person.3. To settle the question of disarmament, as set forth in section 2,a special commission is appointed, consisting of representatives fromall organisations which took part in the peace negotiations.4. From the moment of the signature of this peace treaty, bothparties shall immediately give order to cease firing and halt allmilitary operations, taking measures to ensure punctual obedience tothis order.5. At the signature of the treaty, all prisoners made by the twoparties shall be released....For two days now the Bolsheviki had been in control of the city. Thefrightened citizens were creeping out of their cellars to seek theirdead; the barricades in the streets were being removed. Instead ofdiminishing, however, the stories of destruction in Moscow continuedto grow.... And it was under the influence of these fearful reportsthat we decided to go there.Petrograd, after all, in spite of being for a century the seat ofGovernment, is still an artificial city. Moscow is real Russia,Russia as it was and will be; in Moscow we would get the true feelingof the Russian people about the Revolution. Life was more intensethere.For the past week the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee,aided by the rank and file of the Railway Workers, had seized controlof the Nicolai Railroad, and hurled trainload after trainload ofsailors and Red Guards southwest.... We were provided with passes fromSmolny, without which no one could leave the capital.... When the trainbacked into the station, a mob of shabby soldiers, all carrying hugesacks of eatables, stormed the doors, smashed the windows, and pouredinto all the compartments, filling up the aisles and even climbingonto the roof. Three of us managed to wedge our way into acompartment, but almost immediately about twenty soldiers entered....There was room for only four people; we argued, expostulated, and theconductor joined us-but the soldiers merely laughed. Were they tobother about the comfort of a lot of _boorzhui_ (bourgeois)? Weproduced the passes from Smolny; instantly the soldiers changed theirattitude."Come, comrades," cried one, "these are American _tovarishtchi._ Theyhave come thirty thousand versts to see our Revolution, and they arenaturally tired...."With polite and friendly apologies the soldiers began to leave.Shortly afterward we heard them breaking into a compartment occupiedby two stout, well-dressed Russians, who had bribed the conductor andlocked their door....About seven o'clock in the evening we drew out of the station, animmense long train drawn by a weak little locomotive burning wood,and stumbled along slowly, with many stops. The soldiers on the roofkicked with their heels and sang whining peasant songs; and in thecorridor, so jammed that it was impossible to pass, violent politicaldebates raged all night long. Occasionally the conductor camethrough, as a matter of habit, looking for tickets. He found very fewexcept ours, and after a half-hour of futile wrangling, lifted hisarms despairingly and withdrew. The atmosphere was stifling, full ofsmoke and foul odours; if it hadn't been for the broken windows wewould doubtless have smothered during the night.In the morning, hours late, we looked out upon a snowy world. It wasbitter cold. About noon a peasant woman got on with a basket-full ofbread-chunks and a great can of luke warm coffee-substitute. Fromthen on until dark there was nothing but the packed train, joltingand stopping, and occasional stations where a ravenous mob swoopeddown on the scantily-furnished buffet and swept it clean.... At one ofthese halts I ran into Nogin and Rykov, the seceding Commissars, whowere returning to Moscow to put their grievances before their ownSoviet,  1and further along was Bukharin, a short, red-bearded manwith the eyes of a fanatic-"more Left than Lenin," they said of him....Then the three strokes of the bell and we made a rush for the train,worming our way through the packed and noisy aisle.... A good-naturedcrowd, bearing the discomfort with humorous patience, interminablyarguing about everything from the situation in Petrograd to theBritish Trade-Union system, and disputing loudly with the few_boorzhui_ who were on board. Before we reached Moscow almost everycar had organised a Committee to secure and distribute food, andthese Committees became divided into political factions, who wrangledover fundamental principles....The station at Moscow was deserted. We went to the office of theCommissar, in order to arrange for our return tickets. He was asullen youth with the shoulder-straps of a Lieutenant; when we showedhim our papers from Smolny, he lost his temper and declared that hewas no Bolshevik, that he represented the Committee of PublicSafety.... It was characteristic-in the general turmoil attending theconquest of the city, the chief railway station had been forgotten bythe victors....Not a cab in sight. A few blocks down the street, however, we woke upa grotesquely-padded _izvostchik_ asleep upright on the box of hislittle sleigh. "How much to the centre of the town?"He scratched his head. "The _barini_ won't be able to find a room inany hotel," he said. "But I'll take you around for a hundredrubles...." Before the Revolution it cost _two!_ We objected, but hesimply shrugged his shoulders. "It takes a good deal of courage todrive a sleigh nowadays," he went on. We could not beat him downbelow fifty.... As we sped along the silent, snowy half-lightedstreets, he recounted his adventures during the six days' fighting."Driving along, or waiting for a fare on the corner," he said, "allof a sudden _pooff!_ a cannon ball exploding here, _pooff!_ a cannonball there, _ratt-ratt!_ a machine-gun.... I gallop, the devilsshooting all around. I get to a nice quiet street and stop, doze alittle, _pooff!_ another cannon ball, _ratt-ratt_.... Devils! Devils!Devils! Brrr!"In the centre of the town the snow-piled streets were quiet with thestillness of convalescence. Only a few arc-lights were burning, onlya few pedestrians hurried along the side-walks. An icy wind blew fromthe great plain, cutting to the bone. At the first hotel we enteredan office illuminated by two candles."Yes, we have some very comfortable rooms, but all the windows areshot out. If the _gospodin_ does not mind a little fresh air...."Down the Tverskaya the shop-windows were broken, and there wereshell-holes and torn-up paving stones in the street. Hotel afterhotel, all full, or the proprietors still so frightened that all theycould say was, "No, no, there is no room! There is no room!" On themain streets, where the great banking-houses and mercantile houseslay, the Bolshevik artillery had been indiscriminately effective. Asone Soviet official told me, "Whenever we didn't know just where the_yunkers_ and White Guards were, we bombarded their pocketbooks...."At the big Hotel National they finally took us in; for we wereforeigners, and the Military Revolutionary Committee had promised toprotect the dwellings of foreigners.... On the top floor the managershowed us where shrapnel had shattered several windows. "Theanimals!" said he, shaking his first at imaginary Bolsheviki. "Butwait! Their time will come; in just a few days now their ridiculousGovernment will fall, and then we shall make them suffer!"We dined at a vegetarian restaurant with the enticing name, "I EatNobody," and Tolstoy's picture prominent on the walls, and thensallied out into the streets.The headquarters of the Moscow Soviet was in the palace of the formerGovernor-General, an imposing white building fronting SkobelievSquare. Red Guards stood sentry at the door. At the head of the wide,formal stairway, whose walls were plastered with announcements ofcommittee-meetings and addresses of political parties, we passedthrough a series of lofty ante-rooms, hung with red-shrouded picturesin gold frames, to the splendid state salon, with its magnificentcrystal lustres and gilded cornices. A low-voiced hum of talk,underlaid with the whirring bass of a score of sewing machines,filled the place. Huge bolts of red and black cotton cloth wereunrolled, serpentining across the parqueted floor and over tables, atwhich sat half a hundred women, cutting and sewing streamers andbanners for the Funeral of the Revolutionary Dead. The faces of thesewomen were roughened and scarred with life at its most difficult;they worked now sternly, many of them with eyes red from weeping....The losses of the Red Army had been heavy.At a desk in one corner was Rogov, an intelligent, bearded man withglasses, wearing the black blouse of a worker. He invited us to marchwith the Central Executive Committee in the funeral procession nextmorning...."It is impossible to teach the Socialist Revolutionaries and theMensheviki anything!" he exclaimed. "They compromise from sheerhabit. Imagine! They proposed that we hold a joint funeral with the_yunkers!"_[Graphic page-251 Questionairre for the Bourgeoioisie]Distributed to all bourgeois households in Moscow by the MoscowMilitary Revolutionary Commitee, so as to provide a basis for therequisition of clothing for the Army and the poor workers. Fortranslation see Appendix 3. (See App. X, Sect. 3)Across the hall came a man in a ragged soldier-coat and _shapka,_whose face was familiar; I recognised Melnichansky, whom I had knownas the watch-maker George Melcher in Bayonne, New Jersey, during thegreat Standard Oil strike. Now, he told me, he was secretary of theMoscow Metal-Workers' Union, and a Commissar of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee during the fighting...."You see me!" he cried, showing his decrepit clothing. "I was withthe boys in the Kremlin when the _yunkers_ came the first time. Theyshut me up in the cellar and swiped my overcoat, my money, watch andeven the ring on my finger. This is all I've got to wear!"From him I learned many details of the bloody six-day battle whichhad rent Moscow in two. Unlike in Petrograd, in Moscow the City Dumahad taken command of the _yunkers_ and White Guards. Rudnev, theMayor, and Minor, president of the Duma, had directed the activitiesof the Committee of Public Safety and the troops. Riabtsev,Commandant of the city, a man of democratic instincts, had hesitatedabout opposing the Military Revolutionary Committee; but the Duma hadforced him.... It was the Mayor who had urged the occupation of theKremlin; "They will never dare fire on you there," he said....One garrison regiment, badly demoralised by long inactivity, had beenapproached by both sides. The regiment held a meeting to decide whataction to take. Resolved, that the regiment remain neutral, andcontinue its present activities-which consisted in peddling rubbersand sunflower seeds!"But worst of all," said Melnichansky, "we had to organise while wewere fighting. The other side knew just what it wanted; but here thesoldiers had their Soviet and the workers theirs.... There was afearful wrangle over who should be Commander-in-chief; some regimentstalked for days before they decided what to do; and when the officerssuddenly deserted us, we had no battle-staff to give orders...."Vivid little pictures he gave me. On a cold grey day he had stood ata corner of the Nikitskaya, which was swept by blasts of machine-gunfire. A throng of little boys were gathered there-street waifs whoused to be newsboys. Shrill, excited as if with a new game, theywaited until the firing slackened, and then tried to run across thestreet.... Many were killed, but the rest dashed backward and forward,laughing, daring each other....Late in the evening I went to the _Dvorianskoye Sobranie_-the Nobles'Club-where the Moscow Bolsheviki were to meet and consider the reportof Nogin, Rykov and the others who had left the Council of People'sCommissars.The meeting-place was a theatre, in which, under the old régime, toaudiences of officers and glittering ladies, amateur presentations ofthe latest French comedy had once taken place.At first the place filled with the intellectuals-those who lived nearthe centre of the town. Nogin spoke, and most of his listeners wereplainly with him. It was very late before the workers arrived; theworking-class quarters were on the outskirts of the town, and nostreet-cars were running. But about midnight they began to clump upthe stairs, in groups of ten or twenty-big, rough men, in coarseclothes, fresh from the battle-line, where they had fought likedevils for a week, seeing their comrades fall all about them.Scarcely had the meeting formally opened before Nogin was assailedwith a tempest of jeers and angry shouts. In vain he tried to argue,to explain; they would not listen. He had left the Council ofPeople's Commissars; he had deserted his post while the battle wasraging. As for the bourgeois press, here in Moscow there was no morebourgeois press; even the City Duma had been dissolved. (See App. X,Sect. 4) Bukharin stood up, savage, logical, with a voice whichplunged and struck, plunged and struck.... Him they listened to withshining eyes. Resolution, to support the action of the Council ofPeople's Commissars, passed by overwhelming majority. So spokeMoscow....[Graphic page-254 Pass to the Kremlin]By this the Military Revolutionary Commitee requests to give a passfor the purpose of investigating the Kremlin, the representatives ofthe American Socialist party attached to the Socialist press,comrades Reed and Bryant.              Chief of the Military Revolutionary Committee                              For the SecretaryLate in the night we went through the empty streets and under theIberian Gate to the great Red Square in front of the Kremlin. Thechurch of Vasili Blazheiny loomed fantastic, its bright-coloured,convoluted and blazoned cupolas vague in the darkness. There was nosign of any damage.... Along one side of the square the dark towers andwalls of the Kremlin stood up. On the high walls flickered redly thelight of hidden flames; voices reached us across the immense place,and the sound of picks and shovels. We crossed over.Mountains of dirt and rock were piled high near the base of the wall.Climbing these we looked down into two massive pits, ten or fifteenfeet deep and fifty yards long, where hundreds of soldiers andworkers were digging in the light of huge fires.A young student spoke to us in German. "The Brotherhood Grave," heexplained. "To-morrow we shall bury here five hundred proletarianswho died for the Revolution."He took us down into the pit. In frantic haste swung the picks andshovels, and the earth-mountains grew. No one spoke. Overhead thenight was thick with stars, and the ancient Imperial Kremlin walltowered up immeasurably."Here in this holy place," said the student, "holiest of all Russia,we shall bury our most holy. Here where are the tombs of the Tsars,our Tsar-the People-shall sleep...." His arm was in a sling, from abullet-wound gained in the fighting. He looked at it. "You foreignerslook down on us Russians because so long we tolerated a mediævalmonarchy," said he. "But we saw that the Tsar was not the only tyrantin the world; capitalism was worse, and in all the countries of theworld capitalism was Emperor.... Russian revolutionary tactics arebest...."As we left, the workers in the pit, exhausted and running with sweatin spite of the cold, began to climb wearily out. Across the RedSquare a dark knot of men came hurrying. They swarmed into the pits,picked up the tools and began digging, digging, without a word....So, all the long night volunteers of the People relieved each other,never halting in their driving speed, and the cold light of the dawnlaid bare the great Square, white with snow, and the yawning brownpits of the Brotherhood Grave, quite finished.We rose before sunrise, and hurried through the dark streets toSkobeliev Square. In all the great city not a human being could beseen; but there was a faint sound of stirring, far and near, like adeep wind coming. In the pale half-light a little group of men andwomen were gathered before the Soviet headquarters, with a sheaf ofgold-lettered red banners-the Central Executive Committee of theMoscow Soviets. It grew light. From afar the vague stirring sounddeepened and became louder, a steady and tremendous bass. The citywas rising. We set out down the Tverskaya, the banners flappingoverhead. The little street chapels along our way were locked anddark, as was the Chapel of the Iberian Virgin, which each new Tsarused to visit before he went to the Kremlin to crown himself, andwhich, day or night, was always open and crowded, and brilliant withthe candles of the devout gleaming on the gold and silver and jewelsof the ikons. Now, for the first time since Napoleon was in Moscow,they say, the candles were out.The Holy Orthodox Church had withdrawn the light of its countenancefrom Moscow, the nest of irreverent vipers who had bombarded theKremlin. Dark and silent and cold were the churches; the priests haddisappeared. There were no popes to officiate at the Red Burial,there had been no sacrament for the dead, nor were any prayers to besaid over the grave of the blasphemers. Tikhon, Metropolitan ofMoscow, was soon to excommunicate the Soviets....Also the shops were closed, and the propertied classes stayed athome-but for other reasons. This was the Day of the People, therumour of whose coming was thunderous as surf....Already through the Iberian Gate a human river was flowing, and thevast Red Square was spotted with people, thousands of them. Iremarked that as the throng passed the Iberian Chapel, where alwaysbefore the passerby had crossed himself, they did not seem to noticeit....We forced our way through the dense mass packed near the Kremlinwall, and stood upon one of the dirt-mountains. Already several menwere there, among them Muranov, the soldier who had been electedCommandant of Moscow-a tall, simple-looking, bearded man with agentle face.Through all the streets to the Red Square the torrents of peoplepoured, thousands upon thousands of them, all with the look of thepoor and the toiling. A military band came marching up, playing the_Internationale,_ and spontaneously the song caught and spread likewind-ripples on a sea, slow and solemn. From the top of the Kremlinwall gigantic banners unrolled to the ground; red, with great lettersin gold and in white, saying, "Martyrs of the Beginning of WorldSocial Revolution," and "Long Live the Brotherhood of Workers of theWorld."A bitter wind swept the Square, lifting the banners. Now from the farquarters of the city the workers of the different factories werearriving, with their dead. They could be seen coming through theGate, the blare of their banners, and the dull red-like blood-of thecoffins they carried. These were rude boxes, made of unplaned woodand daubed with crimson, borne high on the shoulders of rough men whomarched with tears streaming down their faces, and followed by womenwho sobbed and screamed, or walked stiffly, with white, dead faces.Some of the coffins were open, the lid carried behind them; otherswere covered with gilded or silvered cloth, or had a soldier's hatnailed on the top. There were many wreaths of hideous artificialflowers....Through an irregular lane that opened and closed again the processionslowly moved toward us. Now through the Gate was flowing an endlessstream of banners, all shades of red, with silver and gold lettering,knots of crepe hanging from the top-and some Anarchist flags, blackwith white letters. The band was playing the Revolutionary FuneralMarch, and against the immense singing of the mass of people,standing uncovered, the paraders sang hoarsely, choked with sobs....Between the factory-workers came companies of soldiers with theircoffins, too, and squadrons of cavalry, riding at salute, andartillery batteries, the cannon wound with red and black-forever, itseemed. Their banners said, "Long live the Third International!" or"We Want an Honest, General, Democratic Peace!"Slowly the marchers came with their coffins to the entrance of thegrave, and the bearers clambered up with their burdens and went downinto the pit. Many of them were women-squat, strong proletarianwomen. Behind the dead came other women-women young and broken, orold, wrinkled women making noises like hurt animals, who tried tofollow their sons and husbands into the Brotherhood Grave, andshrieked when compassionate hands restrained them. The poor love eachother so!All the long day the funeral procession passed, coming in by theIberian Gate and leaving the Square by way of the Nikolskaya, a riverof red banners, bearing words of hope and brotherhood and stupendousprophecies, against a back-ground of fifty thousand people,-under theeyes of the world's workers and their descendants forever....One by one the five hundred coffins were laid in the pits. Dusk fell,and still the banners came drooping and fluttering, the band playedthe Funeral March, and the huge assemblage chanted. In the leaflessbranches of the trees above the grave the wreaths were hung, likestrange, multi-coloured blossoms. Two hundred men began to shovel inthe dirt. It rained dully down upon the coffins with a thuddingsound, audible beneath the singing....The lights came out. The last banners passed, and the last moaningwomen, looking back with awful intensity as they went. Slowly fromthe great Square ebbed the proletarian tide....I suddenly realised that the devout Russian people no longer neededpriests to pray them into heaven. On earth they were building akingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer, and for which itwas a glory to die....                              Chapter XI                The Conquest of Power (See App. XI, Sect. 1)DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA (See App. XI,Sect. 2)... The first Congress of Soviets, in June of this year, proclaimedthe right of the peoples of Russia to self-determination.The second Congress of Soviets, in November last, confirmed thisinalienable right of the peoples of Russia more decisively anddefinitely.Executing the will of these Congresses, the Council of People'sCommissars has resolved to establish as a basis for its activity inthe question of Nationalities, the following principles:(1) The equality and sovereignty of the peoples of Russia.(2) The right of the peoples of Russia to free self-determination,even to the point of separation and the formation of an independentstate.(3) The abolition of any and all national and national religiousprivileges and disabilities.(4) The free development of national minorities and ethnographicgroups inhabiting the territory of Russia.Decrees will be prepared immediately upon the formation of aCommission on Nationalities.In the name of the Russian Republic,People's Commissar for NationalitiesYUSSOV DJUGASHVILI-STALINPresident of the Council of People's CommissarsV. ULIANOV (LENIN)The Central Rada at Kiev immediately declared Ukraine an independentRepublic, as did the Government of Finland, through the Senate atHelsingfors. Independent "Governments" spring up in Siberia and theCaucasus. The Polish Chief Military Committee swiftly gatheredtogether the Polish troops in the Russian army, abolished theirCommittees and established an iron discipline....All these "Governments" and "movements" had two characteristics incommon; they were controlled by the propertied classes, and theyfeared and detested Bolshevism....Steadily, amid the chaos of shocking change, the Council of People'sCommissars hammered at the scaffolding of the Socialist order.Decree on Social Insurance, on Workers' Control, Regulations forVolost Land Committees, Abolition of Ranks and Titles, Abolition ofCourts and the Creation of People's Tribunals.... (See App. XI, Sect.3)Army after army, fleet after fleet, sent deputations, "joyfully togreet the new Government of the People."In front of Smolny, one day, I saw a ragged regiment just come fromthe trenches. The soldiers were drawn up before the great gates,thin and grey-faced, looking up at the building as if God were init. Some pointed out the Imperial eagles over the door, laughing....Red Guards came to mount guard. All the soldiers turned to look,curiously, as if they had heard of them but never seen them. Theylaughed good-naturedly and pressed out of line to slap the RedGuards on the back, with half-joking, half-admiring remarks....The Provisional Government was no more. On November 15th, in all thechurches of the capital, the priests stopped praying for it. But asLenin himself told the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ that was "only the beginningof the conquest of power." Deprived of arms, the opposition, whichstill controlled the economic life of the country, settled down toorganise disorganisation, with all the Russian genius forcooperative action-to obstruct, cripple and discredit the Soviets.The strike of Government employees was well organised, financed bythe banks and commercial establishments. Every move of theBolsheviki to take over the Government apparatus was resisted.Trotzky went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the functionariesrefused to recognise him, locked themselves in, and when the doorswere forced, resigned. He demanded the keys of the archives; onlywhen he brought workmen to force the locks were they given up. Thenit was discovered that Neratov, former assistant Foreign Minister,had disappeared with the Secret Treaties....Shliapnikov tried to take possession of the Ministry of Labour. Itwas bitterly cold, and there was no one to light the fires. Of allthe hundreds of employees, not one would show him where the officeof the Minister was....Alexandra Kollontai, appointed the 13th of November Commissar ofPublic Welfare-the department of charities and publicinstitutions-was welcomed with a strike of all but forty of thefunctionaries in the Ministry. Immediately the poor of the greatcities, the inmates of institutions, were plunged in miserable want:delegations of starving cripples, of orphans with blue, pinchedfaces, besieged the building. With tears streaming down her face,Kollontai arrested the strikers until they should deliver the keysof the office and the safe; when she got the keys, however, it wasdiscovered that the former Minister, Countess Panina, had gone offwith all the funds, which she refused to surrender except on theorder of the Constituent Assembly. (See App. XI, Sect. 4)In the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Supplies, theMinistry of Finance, similar incidents occurred. And the employees,summoned to return or forfeit their positions and their pensions,either stayed away or returned to sabotage.... Almost all the_intelligentzia_ being anti-Bolshevik, there was nowhere for theSoviet Government to recruit new staffs....The private banks remained stubbornly closed, with a back door openfor speculators. When Bolshevik Commissars entered, the clerks left,secreting the books and removing the funds. All the employees of theState Bank struck except the clerks in charge of the vaults and themanufacture of money, who refused all demands from Smolny andprivately paid out huge sums to the Committee for Salvation and theCity Duma.Twice a Commissar, with a company of Red Guards, came formally toinsist upon the delivery of large sums for Government expenses. Thefirst time, the City Duma members and the Menshevik and SocialistRevolutionary leaders were present in imposing numbers, and spoke sogravely of the consequences that the Commissar was frightened. Thesecond time he arrived with a warrant, which he proceeded to readaloud in due form; but some one called his attention to the factthat it had no date and no seal, and the traditional Russian respectfor "documents" forced him again to withdraw....The officials of the Credit Chancery destroyed their books, so thatall record of the financial relations of Russia with foreigncountries was lost.The Supply Committees, the administrations of the Municipal-ownedpublic utilities, either did not work at all, or sabotaged. And whenthe Bolsheviki, compelled by the desperate needs of the citypopulation, attempted to help or to control the public service, allthe employees went on strike immediately, and the Duma floodedRussia with telegrams about Bolshevik "violation of Municipalautonomy."At Military headquarters, and in the offices of the Ministries ofWar and Marine, where the old officials had consented to work, theArmy Committees and the high command blocked the Soviets in everyway possible, even to the extent of neglecting the troops at thefront. The _Vikzhel_ was hostile, refusing to transport Soviettroops; every troop-train that left Petrograd was taken out byforce, and railway officials had to be arrested each time-whereuponthe _Vikzhel_ threatened an immediate general strike unless theywere released....Smolny was plainly powerless. The newspapers said that all thefactories of Petrograd must shut down for lack of fuel in threeweeks; the _Vikzhel_ announced that trains must cease running byDecember first; there was food for three days only in Petrograd, andno more coming in; and the Army on the Front was starving.... TheCommittee for Salvation, the various Central Committees, sent wordall over the country, exhorting the population to ignore theGovernment decrees. And the Allied Embassies were either coldlyindifferent, or openly hostile....The opposition newspapers, suppressed one day and reappearing nextmorning under new names, heaped bitter sarcasm on the new regime.(See App. XI, Sect. 5) Even _Novaya Zhizn_ characterised it as "acombination of demagoguery and impotence."From day to day (it said) the Government of the People's Commissarssinks deeper and deeper into the mire of superficial haste. Havingeasily conquered the power... the Bolsheviki can not make use of it.Powerless to direct the existing mechanism of Government, they areunable at the same time to create a new one which might work easilyand freely according to the theories of social experimenters.Just a little while ago the Bolsheviki hadn't enough men to runtheir growing party-a work above all of speakers and writers; wherethen are they going to find trained men to execute the diverse andcomplicated functions of government?The new Government acts and threatens, it sprays the country withdecrees, each one more radical and more "socialist" than the last.But in this exhibition of Socialism on Paper-more likely designedfor the stupefaction of our descendants-there appears neither thedesire nor the capacity to solve the immediate problems of the day!Meanwhile the _Vikzhel's_ Conference to Form a New Governmentcontinued to meet night and day. Both sides had already agreed inprinciple to the basis of the Government; the composition of thePeople's Council was being discussed; the Cabinet was tentativelychosen, with Tchernov as Premier; the Bolsheviki were admitted in alarge minority, but Lenin and Trotzky were barred. The CentralCommittees of the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary parties, theExecutive Committee of the Peasant's Soviets, resolved that,although unalterably opposed to the "criminal politics" of theBolsheviki, they would, "in order to halt the fratricidalbloodshed," not oppose their entrance into the People's Council.The flight of Kerensky, however, and the astounding success of theSoviets everywhere, altered the situation. On the 16th, in a meetingof the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the Left Socialist Revolutionaries insistedthat the Bolsheviki should form a coalition Government with theother Socialist parties; otherwise they would withdraw from theMilitary Revolutionary Committee and the _Tsay-ee-kah._ Malkin said,"The news from Moscow, where our comrades are dying on both sides ofthe barricades, determines us to bring up once more the question oforganisation of power, and it is not only our right to do so, butour duty.... We have won the right to sit with the Bolsheviki herewithin the walls of Smolny Institute, and to speak from thistribune. After the bitter internal party struggle, we shall beobliged, if you refuse to compromise, to pass to open battleoutside.... We must propose to the democracy terms of an acceptablecompromise...."After a recess to consider this ultimatum, the Bolsheviki returnedwith a resolution, read by Kameniev:The _Tsay-ee-kah_ considers it necessary that there enter into theGovernment representatives of _all the Socialist parties composingthe Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies whorecognise the conquests of the Revolution of November 7th-that is tosay, the establishment of a Government of Soviets, the decrees onpeace, land, workers' control over industry, and the arming of theworking-class._ The _Tsay-ee-kah_ therefore resolves to proposenegotiations concerning the constitution of the Government to allparties _of the Soviet,_ and insists upon the following conditionsas a basis:The Government is responsible to the _Tsay-ee-kah._ The_Tsay-ee-kah_ shall be enlarged to 150 members. To these 150delegates of the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies shall beadded 75 delegates of the _Provincial_ Soviets of Peasants'Deputies, 80 from the Front organisations of the Army and Navy, 40from the Trade Unions (25 from the various All-Russian Unions, inproportion to their importance, 10 from the _Vikzhel,_ and 5 fromthe Post and Telegraph Workers), and 50 delegates from the Socialistgroups in the Petrograd City Duma. In the Ministry itself, at leastone-half the portfolios must be reserved to the Bolsheviki. TheMinistries of Labour, Interior and Foreign Affairs must be given tothe Bolsheviki. The command of the garrisons of Petrograd and Moscowmust remain in the hands of delegates of the Moscow and PetrogradSoviets.The Government undertakes the systematic arming of the workers ofall Russia.It is resolved to insist upon the candidature of comrades Lenin andTrotzky.Kameniev explained. "The so-called 'People's Council,'" he said,"proposed by the Conference, would consist of about 420 members, ofwhich about 150 would be Bolsheviki. Besides, there would bedelegates from the counter-revolutionary old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ 100members chosen by the Municipal Dumas-Kornilovtsi all; 100 delegatesfrom the Peasants' Soviets-appointed by Avksentiev, and 80 from theold Army Committees, who no longer represent the soldier masses."We refuse to admit the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and also therepresentatives of the Municipal Dumas. The delegates from thePeasants' Soviets shall be elected by the Congress of Peasants,which we have called, and which will at the same time elect a newExecutive Committee. The proposal to exclude Lenin and Trotzky is aproposal to decapitate our party, and we do not accept it. Andfinally, we see no necessity for a 'People's Council' anyway; theSoviets are open to all Socialist parties, and the _Tsay-ee-kah_represents them in their real proportions among the masses...."Karelin, for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, declared that hisparty would vote for the Bolshevik resolution, reserving the rightto modify certain details, such as the representation of thepeasants, and demanding that the Ministry of Agriculture be reservedfor the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. This was agreed to....Later, at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, Trotzky answered aquestion about the formation of the new Government:"I don't know anything about that. I am not taking part in thenegotiations.... However, I don't think that they are of greatimportance...."That night there was great uneasiness in the Conference. Thedelegates of the City Duma withdrew....But at Smolny itself, in the ranks of the Bolshevik party, aformidable opposition to Lenin's policy was growing. On the night ofNovember 17th the great hall was packed and ominous for the meetingof the _Tsay-ee-kah._Larin, Bolshevik, declared that the moment of elections to theConstituent Assembly approached, and it was time to do away with"political terrorism.""The measures taken against the freedom of the press should bemodified. They had their reason during the struggle, but now theyhave no further excuse. The press should be free, except for appealsto riot and insurrection."In a storm of hisses and hoots from his own party, Larin offered thefollowing resolution:The decree of the Council of People's Commissars concerning thePress is herewith repealed.Measures of political repression can only be employed subject todecision of a special tribunal, elected by the _Tsay-ee-kah_proportionally to the strength of the different parties represented;and this tribunal shall have the right also to reconsider measuresof repression already taken.This was met by a thunder of applause, not only from the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries, but also from a part of the Bolsheviki.Avanessov, for the Leninites, hastily proposed that the question ofthe Press be postponed until after some compromise between theSocialist parties had been reached. Overwhelmingly voted down."The revolution which is now being accomplished," went on Avanessov,"has not hesitated to attack private property; and it is as privateproperty that we must examine the question of the Press...."Thereupon he read the official Bolshevik resolution:The suppression of the bourgeois press was dictated not only bypurely military needs in the course of the insurrection, and for thechecking of counter-revolutionary action, but it is also necessaryas a measure of transition toward the establishment of a new régimewith regard to the Press-a régime under which the capitalist ownersof printing-presses and of paper cannot be the all-powerful andexclusive manufacturers of public opinion.We must further proceed to the confiscation of private printingplants and supplies of paper, which should become the property ofthe Soviets, both in the capital and in the provinces, so that thepolitical parties and groups can make use of the facilities ofprinting in proportion to the actual strength of the ideas theyrepresent-in other words, proportionally to the number of theirconstituents.The reëstablishment of the so-called "freedom of the press," thesimple return of printing presses and paper to thecapitalists,-poisoners of the mind of the people-this would be aninadmissible surrender to the will of capital, a giving up of one ofthe most important conquests of the Revolution; in other words, itwould be a measure of unquestionably counter-revolutionary character.Proceeding from the above, the _Tsay-ee-kah_ categorically rejectsall propositions aiming at the reëstablishment of the old régime inthe domain of the Press, and unequivocally supports the point ofview of the Council of People's Commissars on this question, againstpretentions and ultimatums dictated by petty bourgeois prejudices,or by evident surrender to the interests of thecounter-revolutionary bourgeoisie.The reading of this resolution was interrupted by ironical shoutsfrom the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, and bursts of indignationfrom the insurgent Bolsheviki. Karelin was on his feet, protesting."Three weeks ago the Bolsheviki were the most ardent defenders ofthe freedom of the Press... The arguments in this resolution suggestsingularly the point of view of the old Black Hundreds and thecensors of the Tsarist régime-for they also talked of 'poisoners ofthe mind of the people.'"Trotzky spoke at length in favour of the resolution. Hedistinguished between the Press during the civil war, and the Pressafter the victory. "During civil war the right to use violencebelongs only to the oppressed...." (Cries of "Who's the oppressed now?Cannibal!")."The victory over our adversaries is not yet achieved, and thenewspapers are arms in their hands. In these conditions, the closingof the newspapers is a legitimate measure of defence...." Then passingto the question of the Press after the victory, Trotzky continued:"The attitude of Socialists on the question of freedom of the Pressshould be the same as their attitude toward the freedom ofbusiness.... The rule of the democracy which is being established inRussia demands that the domination of the Press by private propertymust be abolished, just as the domination of industry by privateproperty.... The power of the Soviets should confiscate allprinting-plants." (Cries, "Confiscate the printing-shop of_Pravda!_")"The monopoly of the Press by the bourgeoisie must be abolished.Otherwise it isn't worth while for us to take the power! Each groupof citizens should have access to print shops and paper.... Theownership of print-type and of paper belongs first to the workersand peasants, and only afterwards to the bourgeois parties, whichare in a minority.... The passing of the power into the hands of theSoviets will bring about a radical transformation of the essentialconditions of existence, and this transformation will necessarily beevident in the Press.... If we are going to nationalise the banks, canwe then tolerate the financial journals? The old régime must die;that must be understood once and for all...." Applause and angry cries.Karelin declared that the _Tsay-ee-kah_ had no right to pass uponthis important question, which should be left to a specialcommittee. Again, passionately, he demanded that the Press be free.Then Lenin, calm, unemotional, his forehead wrinkled, as he spokeslowly, choosing his words; each sentence falling like ahammer-blow. "The civil war is not yet finished; the enemy is stillwith us; consequently it is impossible to abolish the measures ofrepression against the Press."We Bolsheviki have always said that when we reached a position ofpower we would close the bourgeois press. To tolerate the bourgeoisnewspapers would mean to cease being a Socialist. When one makes aRevolution, one cannot mark time; one must always go forward-or goback. He who now talks about the 'freedom of the Press' goesbackward, and halts our headlong course toward Socialism."We have thrown off the yoke of capitalism, just as the firstrevolution threw off the yoke of Tsarism. _If the first revolutionhad the right to suppress the Monarchist papers,_ then we have theright to suppress the bourgeois press. It is impossible to separatethe question of the freedom of the Press from the other questions ofthe class struggle. We have promised to close these newspapers, andwe shall do it. The immense majority of the people is with us!"Now that the insurrection is over, we have absolutely no desire tosuppress the papers of the other Socialist parties, except inasmuchas they appeal to armed insurrection, or to disobedience to theSoviet Government. However, we shall not permit them, under thepretence of freedom of the Socialist press, to obtain, through thesecret support of the bourgeoisie, a monopoly of printing-presses,ink and paper.... These essentials must become the property of theSoviet Government, and be apportioned, first of all, to theSocialist parties in strict proportion to their voting strength...."Then the vote. The resolution of Larin and the Left SocialistRevolutionaries was defeated by 31 to 22; the Lenin motion wascarried by 34 to 24. Among the minority were the Bolsheviki Riazanovand Lozovsky, who declared that it was impossible for them to voteagainst any restriction on the freedom of the Press.Upon this the Left Socialist Revolutionaries declared they could nolonger be responsible for what was being done, and withdrew from theMilitary Revolutionary Committee and all other positions ofexecutive responsibility.Five members-Nogin, Rykov, Miliutin, Teodorovitch andShiapnikov-resigned from the Council of People's Commissars,declaring:We are in favour of a Socialist Government composed of all theparties in the Soviets. We consider that only the creation of such aGovernment can possibly guarantee the results of the heroic struggleof the working-class and the revolutionary army. Outside of that,there remains only one way: the constitution of a purely BolshevikGovernment by means of political terrorism. This last is the roadtaken by the Council of People's Commissars. We cannot and will notfollow it. We see that this leads directly to the elimination frompolitical life of many proletarian organisations, to theestablishment of an irresponsible régime, and to the destruction ofthe Revolution and the country. We cannot take the responsibilityfor such a policy, and we renounce before the _Tsay-ee-kah_ ourfunction as People's Commissars.Other Commissars, without resigning their positions, signed thedeclaration-Riazanov, Derbychev of the Press Department, Arbuzov, ofthe Government Printing-plant, Yureniev, of the Red Guard, Feodorov,of the Commissariat of Labour, and Larin, secretary of the Sectionof Elaboration of Decrees.At the same time Kameniev, Rykov, Miliutin, Zinoviev and Noginresigned from the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party, makingpublic their reasons:... The constitution of such a Government (composed of all the partiesof the Soviet) is indispensable to prevent a new flow of blood, thecoming famine, the destruction of the Revolution by the Kaledinists,to assure the convocation of the Constituent Assembly at the propertime, and to apply effectively the programme adopted by the Congressof Soviets....We cannot accept the responsibility for the disastrous policy of theCentral Committee, carried on against the will of an enormousmajority of the proletariat and the soldiers, who are eager to seethe rapid end of the bloodshed between the different politicalparties of the democracy.... We renounce our title as members of theCentral Committee, in order to be able to say openly our opinion tothe masses of workers and soldiers....We leave the Central Committee at the moment of victory; we cannotcalmly look on while the policy of the chiefs of the CentralCommittee leads toward the loss of the fruits of victory and thecrushing of the proletariat....The masses of the workers, the soldiers of the garrison, stirredrestlessly, sending their delegations to Smolny, to the Conferencefor Formation of the New Government, where the break in the ranks ofthe Bolsheviki caused the liveliest joy.But the answer of the Leninites was swift and ruthless. Shliapnikovand Teodorovitch submitted to party discipline and returned to theirposts. Kameniev was stripped of his powers as president of the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ and Sverdlov elected in his place. Zinoviev wasdeposed as president of the Petrograd Soviet. On the morning of the5th, _Pravda_ contained a ferocious proclamation to the people ofRussia, written by Lenin, which was printed in hundreds of thousandsof copies, posted on the walls everywhere, and distributed over theface of Russia.The second All-Russian Congress of Soviets gave the majority to theBolshevik party. Only a Government formed by this party cantherefore be a Soviet Government. And it is known to all that theCentral Committee of the Bolshevik party, a few hours before theformation of the new Government and before proposing the list of itsmembers to the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, invited to itsmeeting three of the most eminent members of the Left SocialistRevolutionary group, comrades Kamkov, Spiro and Karelin, and ASKEDTHEM to participate in the new Government. We regret infinitely thatthe invited comrades refused; we consider their refusal inadmissiblefor revolutionists and champions of the working-class; we arewilling at any time to include the Left Socialist Revolutionaries inthe Government; but we declare that, as the party of the majority atthe second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, we are entitled andBOUND before the people to form a Government....... Comrades! Several members of the Central Committee of our partyand the Council of People's Commissars, Kameniev, Zinoviev, Nogin,Rykov, Miliutin and a few others left yesterday, November 17th, theCentral Committee of our party, and the last three, the Council ofPeople's Commissars....The comrades who left us acted like deserters, because they not onlyabandoned the posts entrusted to them, but also disobeyed the directinstructions of the Central Committee of our party, to the effectthat they should await the decisions of the Petrograd and Moscowparty organisations before retiring. We blame decisively suchdesertion. We are firmly convinced that all conscious workers,soldiers and peasants, belonging to our party or sympathising withit, will also disapprove of the behaviour of the deserters....Remember, comrades, that two of these deserters, Kameniev andZinoviev, even before the uprising in Petrograd, appeared asdeserters and strike-breakers, by voting at the decisive meeting ofthe Central Committee, October 23d, 1917, against the insurrection;and even AFTER the resolution passed by the Central Committee, theycontinued their campaign at a meeting of the party workers.... But thegreat impulse of the masses, the great heroism of millions ofworkers, soldiers and peasants, in Moscow, Petrograd, at the front,in the trenches, in the villages, pushed aside the deserters as arailway train scatters saw-dust....Shame upon those who are of little faith, hesitate, who doubt, whoallow themselves to be frightened by the bourgeoisie, or who succumbbefore the cries of the latter's direct or indirect accomplices!There is NOT A SHADOW of hesitation in the MASSES of Petrograd,Moscow, and the rest of Russia....... We shall not submit to any ultimatums from small groups ofintellectuals which are not followed by the masses, which arePRACTICALLY only supported by Kornilovists, Savinkovists, _yunkers,_and so forth....The response from the whole country was like a blast of hot storm.The insurgents never got a chance to "say openly their opinion tothe masses of workers and soldiers." Upon the _Tsay-ee-kah_ rolledin like breakers the fierce popular condemnation of the "deserters."For days Smolny was thronged with angry delegations and committees,from the front, from the Volga, from the Petrograd factories. "Whydid they dare leave the Government? Were they paid by thebourgeoisie to destroy the Revolution? They must return and submitto the decisions of the Central Committee!"Only in the Petrograd garrison was there still uncertainty. A greatsoldier meeting was held on November 24th, addressed byrepresentatives of all the political parties. By a vast majorityLenin's policy was sustained, and the Left Socialist Revolutionarieswere told that they must enter the government.... _See next page._The Mensheviki delivered a final ultimatum, demanding that allMinisters and _yunkers_ be released, that all newspapers be allowedfull freedom, that the Red Guard be disarmed and the garrison putunder command of the Duma. To this Smolny answered that all theSocialist Ministers and also all but a very few _yunkers_ had beenalready set free, that all newspapers were free except the bourgeoispress, and that the Soviet would remain in command of the armedforces.... On the 19th the Conference to Form a New Governmentdisbanded, and the opposition one by one slipped away to Moghilev,where, under the wing of the General Staff, they continued to formGovernment after Government, until the end....[Graphic  Page-276 Meeting announcement]Announcement, posted on the walls of Petrograd, of the result of ameeting of representatives of the garrison regiments, called toconsider the question of forming a new Government. For translationsee App. XI, Sect. 6.Meanwhile the Bolsheviki had been undermining the power of the_Vikzhel._ An appeal of the Petrograd Soviet to all railway workerscalled upon them to force the _Vikzhel_ to surrender its powers. Onthe 15th, the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ following its procedure toward thepeasants, called an All-Russian Congress of Railway Workers forDecember 1st; the _Vikzhel_ immediately called its own Congress fortwo weeks later. On November 16th, the _Vikzhel_ members took theirseats in the _Tsay-ee-kah._ On the night of December 2d, at theopening session of the All-Russian Congress of Railway Workers, the_Tsay-ee-kah_ formally offered the post of Commissar of Ways andCommunications to the _Vikzhel_-which accepted....Having settled the question of power, the Bolsheviki turned theirattention to problems of practical administration. First of all thecity, the country, the Army must be fed. Bands of sailors and RedGuards scoured the warehouses, the railway terminals, even thebarges in the canals, unearthing and confiscating thousands of_poods_  1 of food held by private speculators. Emissaries were sentto the provinces, where with the assistance of the Land Committeesthey seized the store-houses of the great grain-dealers. Expeditionsof sailors, heavily armed, were sent out in groups of five thousand,to the South, to Siberia, with roving commissions to capture citiesstill held by the White Guards, establish order, and _get food._Passenger traffic on the Trans-Siberian Railroad was suspended fortwo weeks, while thirteen trains, loaded with bolts of cloth andbars of iron assembled by the Factory-Shop Committees, were sent outeastward, each in charge of a Commissar, to barter with the Siberianpeasants for grain and potatoes....Kaledin being in possession of the coal-mines of the Don, the fuelquestion became urgent. Smolny shut off all electric lights intheatres, shops and restaurants, cut down the number of street cars,and confiscated the private stores of fire-wood held by thefuel-dealers.... And when the factories of Petrograd were about toclose down for lack of coal, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet turnedover to the workers two hundred thousand _poods_ from the bunkers ofbattle-ships....Toward the end of November occurred the "wine-pogroms" (See App. XI,Sect. 7)-looting of the wine-cellars-beginning with the plunderingof the Winter Palace vaults. For days there were drunken soldiers onthe streets.... In all this was evident the hand of thecounter-revolutionists, who distributed among the regiments plansshowing the location of the stores of liquor. The Commissars ofSmolny began by pleading and arguing, which did not stop the growingdisorder, followed by pitched battles between soldiers and RedGuards.... Finally the Military Revolutionary Committee sent outcompanies of sailors with machine-guns, who fired mercilessly uponthe rioters, killing many; and by executive order the wine-cellarswere invaded by Committees with hatchets, who smashed the bottles-orblew them up with dynamite....Companies of Red Guards, disciplined and well-paid, were on duty atthe headquarters of the Ward Soviets day and night, replacing theold Militia. In all quarters of the city small electiveRevolutionary Tribunals were set up by the workers and soldiers todeal with petty crime....The great hotels, where the speculators still did a thrivingbusiness, were surrounded by Red Guards, and the speculators throwninto jail. (See App. XI, Sect. 8)...Alert and suspicious, the working-class of the city constituteditself a vast spy system, through the servants prying into bourgeoishouseholds, and reporting all information to the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee, which struck with an iron hand, unceasing.In this way was discovered the Monarchist plot led by formerDuma-member Purishkevitch and a group of nobles and officers, whohad planned an officers' uprising, and had written a letter invitingKaledin to Petrograd. (See App. XI, Sect. 9).... In this way wasunearthed the conspiracy of the Petrograd Cadets, who were sendingmoney and recruits to Kaledin....Neratov, frightened at the outburst of popular fury provoked by hisflight, returned and surrendered the Secret Treaties to Trotzky, whobegan their publication in _Pravda,_ scandalising the world....[Graphic Page-279 Proclamation ]Bolshevik order. A proclamation of the Committee to Fight againstPogroms, attached to the Petrograd Soviet. For translation seeApp. XI, Sect. 11.The restrictions on the Press were increased by a decree (See App.XI, Sect. 10) making advertisements a monopoly of the officialGovernment newspaper. At this all the other papers suspendedpublication as a protest, or disobeyed the law and were closed....Only three weeks later did they finally submit.Still the strike of the Ministries went on, still the sabotage ofthe old officials, the stoppage of normal economic life. BehindSmolny was only the will of the vast, unorganised popular masses;and with them the Council of People's Commissars dealt, directingrevolutionary mass-action against its enemies. In eloquentproclamations, (See App. XI, Sect. 12) couched in simple words andspread over Russia, Lenin explained the Revolution, urged the peopleto take the power into their own hands, by force to break down theresistance of the propertied classes, by force to take over theinstitutions of Government. Revolutionary order. Revolutionarydiscipline! Strict accounting and control! No strikes! No loafing![Graphic Page-281 Appeal to work hard ]Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet, the Petrograd Council ofProfessional Unions, and the Petrograd Council of Factory ShopCommittees, to the Workers of Petro. grad, urging them to work hardand not to strike. For translation see App. XI, Sect. 13.On the 20th of November the Military Revolutionary Committee issueda warning:The rich classes oppose the power of the Soviets-the Government ofworkers, soldiers and peasants. Their sympathisers halt the work ofthe employees of the Government and the Duma, incite strikes in thebanks, try to interrupt communication by the railways, the post andthe telegraph....We warn them that they are playing with fire. The country and theArmy are threatened with famine. To fight against it, the regularfunctioning of all services is indispensable. The Workers' andPeasants' Government is taking every measure to assure the countryand the Army all that is necessary. Opposition to these measures isa crime against the People. We warn the rich classes and theirsympathisers that, if they do not cease their sabotage and theirprovocation in halting the transportation of food, they will be thefirst to suffer. They will be deprived of the right of receivingfood. All the reserves which they possess will be requisitioned. Theproperty of the principal criminals will be confiscated.We have done our duty in warning those who play with fire.We are convinced that in case decisive measures become necessary, weshall be solidly supported by all workers, soldiers, and peasants.On the 22d of November the walls of the city were placarded with asheet headed "EXTRAORDINARY COMMUNICATION":The Council of People's Commissars has received an urgent telegramfrom the Staff of the Northern Front...."There must be no further delay; do not let the Army die of hunger;the armies of the Northern Front have not received a crust of breadnow for several days, and in two or three days they will not haveany more biscuits-which are being doled out to them from reservesupplies until now never touched.... Already delegates from all partsof the Front are talking of a necessary removal of part of the Armyto the rear, foreseeing that in a few days there will be headlongflight of the soldiers, dying from hunger, ravaged by the threeyears' war in the trenches, sick, insufficiently clothed,bare-footed, driven mad by superhuman misery."The Military Revolutionary Committee brings this to the notice ofthe Petrograd garrison and the workers of Petrograd. The situationat the Front demands the most urgent and decisive measures. ...Meanwhile the higher functionaries of the Government institutions,banks, railroads, post and telegraph, are on strike and impeding thework of the Government in supplying the Front with provisions.... Eachhour of delay may cost the life of thousands of soldiers. Thecounter-revolutionary functionaries are the most dishonest criminalstoward their hungry and dying brethren on the Front....The MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE GIVES THESE CRIMINALS A LASTWARNING. In event of the least resistance or opposition on theirpart, the harshness of the measures which will be adopted againstthem will correspond to the seriousness of their crime....------------------+----------+The masses of workers and soldiers responded by a savage tremor ofrage, which swept all Russia. In the capital the Government and bankemployees got out hundreds of proclamations and appeals (See App.XI, Sect. 14), protesting, defending themselves, such as this one:TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL CITIZENS.THE STATE BANK IS CLOSED!WHY?Because the violence exercised by the Bolsheviki against the StateBank has made it impossible for us to work. The first act of thePeople's Commissars was to DEMAND TEN MILLION RUBLES, and onNovember 27th THEY DEMANDED TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS, without anyindication as to where this money was to go.... We functionaries cannot take part in plundering the people'sproperty. We stopped work.CITIZENS! The money in the State Bank is yours, the people's money,acquired by your labour, your sweat and blood. CITIZENS! Save thepeople's property from robbery, and us from violence, and we shallimmediately resume work.EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE BANK.From the Ministry of Supplies, the Ministry of Finance, from theSpecial Supply Committee, declarations that the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee made it impossible for the employees towork, appeals to the population to support them against Smolny.... Butthe dominant worker and soldier did not believe them; it was firmlyfixed in the popular mind that the employees were sabotaging,starving the Army, starving the people.... In the long bread lines,which as formerly stood in the iron winter streets, it was not _theGovernment_ which was blamed, as it had been under Kerensky, but the_tchinovniki,_ the sabotageurs; for the Government was _their_Government, _their_ Soviets-and the functionaries of the Ministrieswere against it....At the centre of all this opposition was the Duma, and its militantorgan, the Committee for Salvation, protesting against all thedecrees of the Council of People's Commissars, voting again andagain not to recognise the Soviet Government, openly cooperatingwith the new counter-revolutionary "Governments" set up atMoghilev.... On the 17th of November, for example, the Committee forSalvation addressed "all Municipal Governments, Zemstvos, and alldemocratic and revolutionary organisations of peasants, workers,soldiers and other citizens," in these words:Do not recognise the Government of the Bolsheviki, and struggleagainst it.Form local Committees for Salvation of Country and Revolution, whowill unite all democratic forces, so as to aid the All-RussianCommittee for Salvation in the tasks which it has set itself....Meanwhile the elections for the Constituent Assembly in Petrograd(See App. XI, Sect. 15) gave an enormous plurality to theBolsheviki; so that even the Mensheviki Internationalists pointedout that the Duma ought to be re-elected, as it no longerrepresented the political composition of the Petrograd population....At the same time floods of resolutions from workers' organisations,from military units, even from the peasants in the surroundingcountry, poured in upon the Duma, calling it "counter-revolutionary,Kornilovitz," and demanding that it resign. The last days of theDuma were stormy with the bitter demands of the Municipal workersfor decent living wages, and the threat of strikes....On the 23d a formal decree of the Military Revolutionary Committeedissolved the Committee for Salvation. On the 29th, the Council ofPeople's Commissars ordered the dissolution and re-election of thePetrograd City Duma:In view of the fact that the Central Duma of Petrograd, electedSeptember 2d, ... has definitely lost the right to represent thepopulation of Petrograd, being in complete disaccord with its stateof mind and its aspirations ... and in view of the fact that thepersonnel of the Duma majority, although having lost all politicalfollowing, continues to make use of its prerogatives to resist in acounter-revolutionary manner the will of the workers, soldiers andpeasants, to sabotage and obstruct the normal work of theGovernment-the Council of People's Commissars considers it its dutyto invite the population of the capital to pronounce judgment on thepolicy of the organ of Municipal autonomy.To this end the Council of People's Commissars resolves:(1) To dissolve the Municipal Duma; the dissolution to take effectNovember 30th, 1917.(2) All functionaries elected or appointed by the present Duma shallremain at their posts and fulfil the duties confided to them, untiltheir places shall be filled by representatives of the new Duma.(3) All Municipal employees shall continue to fulfil their duties;those who leave the service of their own accord shall be considereddischarged.(4) The new elections for the Municipal Duma of Petrograd are fixedfor December 9th, 1917....(5) The Municipal Duma of Petrograd shall meet December 11th, 1917,at two o'clock.(6) Those who disobey this decree, as well as those whointentionally harm or destroy the property of the Municipality,shall be immediately arrested and brought before the RevolutionaryTribunals....The Duma met defiantly, passing resolutions to the effect that itwould "defend its position to the last drop of its blood," andappealing desperately to the population to save their "own electedCity Government." But the population remained indifferent orhostile. On the 31st Mayor Schreider and several members werearrested, interrogated, and released. That day and the next the Dumacontinued to meet, interrupted frequently by Red Guards and sailors,who politely requested the assembly to disperse. At the meeting ofDecember 2d, an officer and some sailors entered the Nicolai Hallwhile a member was speaking, and ordered the members to leave, orforce would be used. They did so, protesting to the last, butfinally "ceding to violence."The new Duma, which was elected ten days later, and for which the"Moderate" Socialists refused to vote, was almost entirelyBolshevik....There remained several centres of dangerous opposition, such as the"republics" of Ukraine and Finland, which were showing definitelyanti-Soviet tendencies. Both at Helsingfors and at Kiev theGovernments were gathering troops which could be depended upon, andentering upon campaigns of crushing Bolshevism, and of disarming andexpelling Russian troops. The Ukrainean Rada had taken command ofall southern Russia, and was furnishing Kaledin reinforcements andsupplies. Both Finland and Ukraine were beginning secretnegotiations with the Germans, and were promptly recognised by theAllied Governments, which loaned them huge sums of money, joiningwith the propertied classes to create counter-revolutionary centresof attack upon Soviet Russia. In the end, when Bolshevism hadconquered in both these countries, the defeated bourgeoisie calledin the Germans to restore them to power....But the most formidable menace to the Soviet Government was internaland two-headed-the Kaledin movement, and the Staff at Moghilev,where General Dukhonin had assumed command.Graphic Page-287 Education Proclamation]Proclamation of the Commission of Public Education attached to theCity Duma, concerning the strike of school-teachers, just before theChristmas holidays. The Duma had been re-elected, and was composedalmost entirely of Bolsheviki. For translation see App. XI, Sect. 17.The ubiquitous Muraviov was appointed commander of the war againstthe Cossacks, and a Red Army was recruited from among the factoryworkers. Hundreds of propagandists were sent to the Don. The Councilof People's Commissars issued a proclamation to the Cossacks, (SeeApp. XI, Sect. 16) explaining what the Soviet Government was, howthe propertied classes, the _tchin ovniki,_ landlords, bankers andtheir allies, the Cossack princes, land-owners and Generals, weretrying to destroy the Revolution, and prevent the confiscation oftheir wealth by the people.On November 27th a committee of Cossacks came to Smolny to seeTrotzky and Lenin. They demanded if it were true that the SovietGovernment did not intend to divide the Cossack lands among thepeasants of Great Russia? "No," answered Trotzky. The Cossacksdeliberated for a while. "Well," they asked, "does the SovietGovernment intend to confiscate the estates of our great Cossackland-owners and divide them among the working Cossacks?" To thisLenin replied. "That," he said, "is for _you_ to do. We shallsupport the working Cossacks in all their actions.... The best way tobegin is to form Cossacks Soviets; you will be given representationin the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and then it will be _your_ Government, too....The Cossacks departed, thinking hard. Two weeks later GeneralKaledin received a deputation from his troops. "Will you," theyasked, "promise to divide the great estates of the Cossack landlordsamong the working Cossacks?""Only over my dead body," responded Kaledin. A month later, seeinghis army melt away before his eyes, Kaledin blew out his brains. Andthe Cossack movement was no more....Meanwhile at Moghilev were gathered the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ the"moderate" Socialist leaders-from Avksentiev to Tchernov-the activechiefs of the old Army Committees, and the reactionary officers. TheStaff steadily refused to recognise the Council of People'sCommissars. It had united about it the Death Battalions, the Knightsof St. George, and the Cossacks of the Front, and was in close andsecret touch with the Allied military attachès, and with the Kaledinmovement and the Ukrainean Rada....The Allied Governments had made no reply to the Peace decree ofNovember 8th, in which the Congress of Soviets had asked for ageneral armistice.On November 20th Trotzky addressed a note to the Allied Ambassadors:(See App. XI, Sect. 18)I have the honour to inform you, Mr. Ambassador, that theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets... on November 8th constituted a newGovernment of the Russian Republic, in the form of the Council ofPeople's Commissars. The President of this Government is VladimirIlyitch Lenin. The direction of Foreign Affairs has been entrustedto me, People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs....In drawing your attention to the text, approved by the All-RussianCongress, of the proposition for an armistice and a democratic peacewithout annexations or indemnities, based on the right ofself-determination of peoples, I have the honour to request you toconsider that document as a formal proposal of an immediatearmistice on all fronts, and the opening of immediate peacenegotiations; a proposal which the authorised Government of theRussian Republic addresses at the same time to all the belligerentpeoples and their Governments.Please accept, Mr. Ambassador, the profound assurance of the esteemof the Soviet Government toward your people, who cannot but wish forpeace, like all the other peoples exhausted and drained by thisunexampled butchery....The same night the Council of People's Commissars telegraphed toGeneral Dukhonin:... The Council of People's Commissars considers it indispensablewithout delay to make a formal proposal of armistice to all thepowers, both enemy and Allied. A declaration conforming to thisdecision has been sent by the Commissar for Foreign Affairs to therepresentatives of the Allied powers at Petrograd.The Council of People's Commissars orders you, Citizen Commander,...to propose to the enemy military authorities immediately to ceasehostilities, and enter into negotiations for peace.In charging you with the conduct of these preliminary pourparlers,the Council of People's Commissars orders you:1. To inform the Council by direct wire immediately of any and allsteps in the pourparlers with the representatives of the enemyarmies.2. Not to sign the act of armistice until it has been passed upon bythe Council of People's Commissars.The Allied Ambassadors received Trotzky's note with contemptuoussilence, accompanied by anonymous interviews in the newspapers, fullof spite and ridicule. The order to Dukhonin was characterisedopenly as an act of treason....As for Dukhonin, he gave no sign. On the night of November 22nd hewas communicated with by telephone, and asked if he intended to obeythe order. Dukhonin answered that he could not, unless it emanatedfrom "a Government sustained by the Army and the country."By telegraph he was immediately dismissed from the post of SupremeCommander, and Krylenko appointed in his place. Following histactics of appealing to the masses, Lenin sent a radio to allregimental, divisional and corps Committees, to all soldiers andsailors of the Army and the Fleet, acquainting them with Dukhonin'srefusal, and ordering that "the regiments on the front shall electdelegates to begin negotiations with the enemy detachments oppositetheir positions...."On the 23d, the military attaches of the Allied nations, acting oninstructions from their Governments, presented a note to Dukhonin,in which he was solemnly warned not to "violate the conditions ofthe treaties concluded between the Powers of the Entente." The notewent on to say that if a separate armistice with Germany wereconcluded, that act "would result in the most serious consequences"to Russia. This communication Dukhonin at once sent out to all thesoldiers' Committees....Next morning Trotzky made another appeal to the troops,characterising the note of the Allied representatives as a flagrantinterference in the internal affairs of Russia, and a bald attempt"to force by threats the Russian Army and the Russian people tocontinue the war in execution of the treaties concluded by theTsar...."From Smolny poured out proclamation after proclamation, (See App.XI, Sect. 19) denouncing Dukhonin and the counter-revolutionaryofficers about him, denouncing the reactionary politicians gatheredat Moghilev, rousing, from one end of the thousand-mile Front to theother, millions of angry, suspicious soldiers. And at the same timeKrylenko, accompanied by three detachments of fanatical sailors, setout for the _Stavka,_ breathing threats of vengeance, (See App. XI,Sect. 20) and received by the soldiers everywhere with tremendousovations-a triumphal progress. The Central Army Committee issued adeclaration in favour of Dukhonin; and at once ten thousand troopsmoved upon Moghilev....On December 2d the garrison of Moghilev rose and seized the city,arresting Dukhonin and the Army Committee, and going out withvictorious red banners to meet the new Supreme Commander. Krylenkoentered Moghilev next morning, to find a howling mob gathered aboutthe railway-car in which Dukhonin had been imprisoned. Krylenko madea speech in which he implored the soldiers not to harm Dukhonin, ashe was to be taken to Petrograd and judged by the RevolutionaryTribunal. When he had finished, suddenly Dukhonin himself appearedat the window, as if to address the throng. But with a savage roarthe people rushed the car, and falling upon the old General, draggedhim out and beat him to death on the platform....So ended the revolt of the _Stavka_....Immensely strengthened by the collapse of the last importantstronghold of hostile military power in Russia, the SovietGovernment began with confidence the organisation of the state. Manyof the old functionaries flocked to its banner, and many members ofother parties entered the Government service. The financiallyambitious, however, were checked by the decree on Salaries ofGovernment Employees, fixing the salaries of the People'sCommissars-the highest-at five hundred rubles (about fifty dollars)a month.... The strike of Government Employees, led by the Union ofUnions, collapsed, deserted by the financial and commercialinterests which had been backing it. The bank clerks returned totheir jobs....With the decree on the Nationalisation of Banks, the formation ofthe Supreme Council of People's Economy, the putting into practicaloperation of the Land decree in the villages, the democraticreorganisation of the Army, and the sweeping changes in all branchesof the Government and of life,-with all these, effective only by thewill of the masses of workers, soldiers and peasants, slowly began,with many mistakes and hitches, the moulding of proletarian Russia.Not by compromise with the propertied classes, or with the otherpolitical leaders; not by conciliating the old Government mechanism,did the Bolsheviki conquer the power. Nor by the organized violenceof a small clique. If the masses all over Russia had not been readyfor insurrection it must have failed. The only reason for Bolsheviksuccess lay in their accomplishing the vast and simple desires ofthe most profound strata of the people, calling them to the work oftearing down and destroying the old, and afterward, in the smoke offalling ruins, cooperating with them to erect the frame-work of thenew....                              Chapter XII                        The Peasants' CongressIT was on November 18th that the snow came. In the morning we woketo window-ledges heaped white, and snowflakes falling so whirlingthick that it was impossible to see ten feet ahead. The mud wasgone; in a twinkling the gloomy city became white, dazzling. The_droshki_ with their padded coachmen turned into sleights, boundingalong the uneven street at headlong speed, their drivers' beardsstiff and frozen.... In spite of Revolution, all Russia plungingdizzily into the unknown and terrible future, joy swept the citywith the coming of the snow. Everybody was smiling; people ran intothe streets, holding out their arms to the soft, falling flakes,laughing. Hidden was all the greyness; only the gold and colouredspires and cupolas, with heightened barbaric splendour, gleamedthrough the white snow.Even the sun came out, pale and watery, at noon. The colds andrheumatism of the rainy months vanished. The life of the city grewgay, and the very Revolution ran swifter....I sat one evening in a _traktir_-a kind of lower-class inn-acrossthe street from the gates of Smolny; a low-ceilinged, loud placecalled "Uncle Tom's Cabin," much frequented by Red Guards. Theycrowded it now, packed close around the little tables with theirdirty table-cloths and enormous china tea-pots, filling the placewith foul cigarette-smoke, while the harassed waiters ran aboutcrying _"Seichass! Seichass!_ In a minute! Right away!"In one corner sat a man in the uniform of a captain, addressing theassembly, which interrupted him at every few words."You are no better than murderers!" he cried. "Shooting down yourRussian brothers on the streets!""When did we do that?" asked a worker."Last Sunday you did it, when the _yunkers_--""Well, didn't they shoot us?" One man exhibited his arm in a sling."Haven't I got something to remember them by, the devils?"The captain shouted at the top of his voice. "You should remainneutral! You should remain neutral! Who are you to destroy the legalGovernment? Who is Lenin? A German--""Who are you? A counter-revolutionist! A provocator!" they bellowedat him.When he could make himself heard the captain stood up. "All right!"said he. "You call yourselves the people of Russia. But you're _not_the people of Russia. The _peasants_ are the people of Russia. Waituntil the peasants--""Yes," they cried, "wait until the peasants speak. We know what thepeasants will say.... Aren't they workingmen like ourselves?"In the long run, everything depended upon the peasants. While thepeasants had been politically backward, still they had their ownpeculiar ideas, and they constituted more than eighty per cent ofthe people of Russia. The Bolsheviki had a comparatively smallfollowing among the peasants; and a permanent dictatorship of Russiaby the industrial workers was impossible.... The traditional peasantparty was the Socialist Revolutionary party; of all the parties nowsupporting the Soviet Government, the Left Socialist Revolutionarieswere the logical inheritors of peasant leadership-and the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries, who were at the mercy of the organisedcity proletariat, desperately needed the backing of the peasants....Meanwhile Smolny had not neglected the peasants. After the Landdecree, one of the first actions of the new _Tsay-ee-kah_ had beento call a Congress of Peasants, over the head of the ExecutiveCommittee of the Peasants' Soviets. A few days later was issueddetailed Regulations for the _Volost_ (Township) Land Committees,followed by Lenin's "Instruction to Peasants," (See App. XII, Sect.1) which explained the Bolshevik revolution and the new Governmentin simple terms; and on November 16th, Lenin and Miliutin publishedthe "Instructions to Provincial Emissaries," of whom thousands weresent by the Soviet Government into the villages.1. Upon his arrival in the province to which he is accredited, theemissary should call a joint meeting of the Central ExecutiveCommittees of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants'Deputies, to whom he should make a report on the agrarian laws, andthen demand that a joint plenary session of the Soviets be summoned....2. He must study the aspects of the agrarian problem in the province.a. Has the land-owners' property been taken over, and if so, in whatdistricts?b. Who administers the confiscated land-the former proprietor, orthe Land Committees?c. What has been done with the agricultural machinery and with thefarm-animals?3. Has the ground cultivated by the peasants been augmented?4. How much and in what respect does the amount of land now undercultivation differ from the amount fixed by the Government as anaverage minimum?5. The emissary must insist that, after the peasants have receivedthe land, it is imperative that they increase the amount ofcultivated land as quickly as possible, and that they hasten thesending of grain to the cities, as the only means of avoiding famine.6. What are the measures projected or put into effect for thetransfer of land from the land-owners to the Land Committees andsimilar bodies appointed by the Soviets?7. It is desirable that agricultural properties well appointed andwell organised should be administered by Soviets composed of theregular employees of those properties, under the direction ofcompetent agricultural scientists.All through the villages a ferment of change was going on, causednot only by the electrifying action of the Land decree, but also bythousands of revolutionary-minded peasant-soldiers returning fromthe front.... These men, especially, welcomed the call to a Congressof Peasants.Like the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ in the matter of the second Congress ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Soviets, the Executive Committee tried toprevent the Peasant Congress summoned by Smolny. And like the old_Tsay-ee-kah,_ finding its resistance futile, the ExecutiveCommittee sent frantic telegrams ordering the election ofConservative delegates. Word was even spread among the peasants thatthe Congress would meet at Moghilev, and some delegates went there;but by November 23d about four hundred had gathered in Petrograd,and the party caucuses had begun....The first session took place in the Alexander Hall of the Dumabuilding, and the first vote showed that more than half of all thedelegates were Left Socialist Revolutionaries, while the Bolshevikicontrolled a bare fifth, the conservative Socialist Revolutionariesa quarter, and all the rest were united only in their opposition tothe old Executive Committee, dominated by Avksentiev, Tchaikovskyand Peshekhonov....The great hall was jammed with people and shaken with continualclamour; deep, stubborn bitterness divided the delegates into angrygroups. To the right was a sprinkling of officers' epaulettes, andthe patriarchal, bearded faces of the older, more substantialpeasants; in the centre were a few peasants, non-commissionedofficers, and some soldiers; and on the left almost all thedelegates wore the uniforms of common soldiers. These last were theyoung generation, who had been serving in the army.... The gallerieswere thronged with workers-who, in Russia, still remember theirpeasant origin....Unlike the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the Executive Committee, in openingthe session, did not recognise the Congress as official; theofficial Congress was called for December 13th; amid a hurricane ofapplause and angry cries, the speaker declared that this gatheringwas merely "Extraordinary Conference"... But the "ExtraordinaryConference" soon showed its attitude toward the Executive Committeeby electing as presiding officer Maria Spiridonova, leader of theLeft Socialist Revolution aries.Most of the first day was taken up by a violent debate as to whetherthe representatives of _Volost_ Soviets should be seated, or onlydelegates from the Provincial bodies; and just as in the Workers'and Soldiers' Congress, an overwhelming majority declared in favourof the widest possible representation. Whereupon the old ExecutiveCommittee left the hall....Almost immediately it was evident that most of the delegates werehostile to the Government of the People's Commissars. Zinoviev,attempting to speak for the Bolsheviki, was hooted down, and as heleft the platform, amid laughter, there were cries, "There's how aPeople's Commissar sits in a mudpuddle!""We Left Socialist Revolutionaries refuse," cried Nazariev, adelegate from the Provinces, "to recognise this so-called Workers'and Peasants' Government until the peasants are represented in it.At present it is nothing but a dictatorship of the workers.... Weinsist upon the formation of a new Government which will representthe entire democracy!"The reactionary delegates shrewdly fostered this feeling, declaring,in the face of protests from the Bolshevik benches, that the Councilof People's Commissars intended either to control the Congress ordissolve it by force of arms-an announcement which was received bythe peasants with bursts of fury....On the third day Lenin suddenly mounted the tribune; for ten minutesthe room went mad. "Down with him!" they shrieked. "We will notlisten to any of your People's Commissars! We don't recognise yourGovernment!"Lenin stood there quite calmly, gripping the desk with both hands,his little eyes thoughtfully surveying the tumult beneath. Finally,except for the right side of the hall, the demonstration wore itselfout somewhat."I do not come here as a member of the Council of People'sCommissars," said Lenin, and waited again for the noise to subside,"but as a member of the Bolshevik faction, duly elected to thisCongress." And he held his credentials up to that all might see them."However," he went on, in an unmoved voice, "nobody will deny thatthe present Government of Russia has been formed by the Bolshevikparty-" he had to wait a moment, "so that for all purposes it is thesame thing...." Here the right benches broke into deafening clamour,but the centre and left were curious, and compelled silence.Lenin's argument was simple. "Tell me frankly, you peasants, to whomwe have given the lands of the _pomieshtchiki;_ do you want now toprevent the workers from getting control of industry? This is classwar. The _pomieshtchiki_ of course oppose the peasants, and themanufactures oppose the workers. Are you going to allow the ranks ofthe proletariat to be divided? Which side will you be on?"We, the Bolsheviki, are the party of the proletariat-of the peasantproletariat as well as the industrial proletariat. We, theBolsheviki, are the protectors of the Soviets-of the Peasants'Soviets as well as those of the Workers and Soldiers. The presentGovernment is a Government of Soviets; we have not only invited thePeasants' Soviets to join that Government, but we have also invitedrepresentatives of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to enter theCouncil of People's Commissars...."The Soviets are the most perfect representatives of the people-ofthe workers in the factories and mines, of the workers in thefields. Anybody who attempts to destroy the Soviets is guilty of ananti-democratic and counter-revolutionary act. And I serve noticehere on you, comrades _Right_ Socialist Revolutionaries-and on you,Messrs. Cadets-that if the Constituent Assembly attempts to destroythe Soviets, we shall not permit the Constituent Assembly to do thisthing!"On the afternoon of November 25th Tchernov arrived in hot haste fromMoghilev, summoned by the Executive Committee. Only two monthsbefore considered an extreme revolutionist, and very popular withthe peasants, he was now called to check the dangerous drift of theCongress toward the Left. Upon his arrival Tchernov was arrested andtaken to Smolny, where, after a short conversation, he was released.His first act was to bitterly rebuke the Executive Committee forleaving the Congress. They agreed to return, and Tchernov enteredthe hall, welcomed with great applause by the majority, and thehoots and jeers of the Bolsheviki."Comrades! I have been away. I participated in the Conference of theTwelfth Army on the question of calling a Congress of all thePeasant delegates of the armies of the Western Front, and I knowvery little about the insurrection which occurred here--"Zinoviev rose in his seat, and shouted, "Yes, you were away-for afew minutes!" Fearful tumult. Cries, "Down with the Bolsheviki!"Tchernov continued. "The accusation that I helped lead an army onPetrograd has no foundation, and is entirely false. Where does suchan accusation come from? Show me the source!"Zinoviev: "_Izviestia_ and _Dielo Naroda_-your own paper -that'swhere it comes from!"Tchernov's wide face, with the small eyes, waving hair and greyishbeard, became red with wrath, but he controlled himself and went on."I repeat, I know practically nothing about what has happened here,and I did not lead any army except this army, (he pointed to thepeasant delegates), which I am largely responsible for bringinghere!" Laughter, and shouts of "Bravo!""Upon my return I visited Smolny. No such accusation was madeagainst me there.... After a brief conversation I left-and that's all!Let any one present make such an accusation!"An uproar followed, in which the Bolsheviki and some of the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries were on their feet all at once, shakingtheir fists and yelling, and the rest of the assembly tried to yellthem down."This is an outrage, not a session!" cried Tchernov, and he left thehall; the meeting was adjourned because of the noise and disorder....Meanwhile, the question of the status of the Executive Committee wasagitating all minds. By declaring the assembly "ExtraordinaryConference," it had been planned to block the reelection of theExecutive Committee. But this worked both ways; the Left SocialistRevolutionists decided that if the Congress had no power over theExecutive Committee, then the Executive Committee had no power overthe Congress. On November 25th the assembly resolved that the powersof the Executive Committee be assumed by the ExtraordinaryConference, in which only members of the Executive who had beenelected as delegates might vote....The next day, in spite of the bitter opposition of the Bolsheviki,the resolution was amended to give all the members of the ExecutiveCommittee, whether elected as delegates or not, voice and vote inthe assembly.On the 27th occurred the debate on the Land question, which revealedthe differences between the agrarian programme of the Bolsheviki andthe Left Socialist Revolutionaries.Kolchinsky, for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, outlined thehistory of the Land question during the Revolution. The firstCongress of Peasants' Soviets, he said, had voted a precise andformal resolution in favour of putting the landed estatesimmediately into the hands of the Land Committees. But the directorsof the Revolution, and the bourgeois in the Government, had insistedthat the question could not be solved until the Constituent Assemblymet.... The second period of the Revolution, the period of"compromise,"was signalled by the entrance of Tchernov into theCabinet. The peasants were convinced that now the practical solutionof the Land question would begin; but in spite of the imperativedecision of the first Peasant Congress, the reactionaries andconciliators in the Executive Committee had prevented any action.This policy provoked a series of agrarian disorders, which appearedas the natural expression of impatience and thwarted energy on thepart of the peasants. The peasants understood the exact meaning ofthe Revolution-they tried to turn words into action...."The recent events," said the orator, "do not indicate a simpleriot, or a 'Bolshevik adventure,' but on the contrary, a realpopular rising, which has been greeted with sympathy by the wholecountry...."The Bolsheviki in general took the correct attitude toward the Landquestion; but in recommending that the peasants seize the land byforce, they committed a profound error.... From the first days, theBolsheviki declared that the peasants should take over the land 'byrevolutionary massaction.' This is nothing but anarchy; the land canbe taken over in an organised manner.... For the Bolsheviki it wasimportant that the problems of the Revolution should be solved inthe quickest possible manner-but the Bolsheviki were not interestedin _how_ these problems were to be solved...."The Land decree of the Congress of Soviets is identical in itsfundamentals with the decisions of the first Peasants' Congress. Whythen did not the new Government follow the tactics outlined by thatCongress? Because the Council of People's Commissars wanted tohasten the settlement of the Land question, so that the ConstituentAssembly would have nothing to do...."But also the Government saw that it was necessary to adoptpractical measures, so without further reflection, it adopted theRegulations for Land Committees, thus creating a strange situation;for the Council of People's Commissars abolished private property inland, but the Regulations drawn up by the Land Committees are basedon private property.... However, no harm has been done by that; forthe Land Committees are paying no attention to the Soviet decrees,but are putting into operation their own practicaldecisions-decisions based on the will of the vast majority of thepeasants...."These Land Committees are not attempting the legislative solutionof the Land question, which belongs to the Constituent Assemblyalone.... But will the Constituent Assembly desire to do the will ofthe Russian peasants? Of that we cannot be sure.... All we can be sureof is that the revolutionary determination of the peasants is nowaroused, and that the Constituent will be _forced_ to settle theLand question the way the peasants want it settled.... The ConstituentAssembly will not dare to break with the will of the people...."Followed him Lenin, listened to now with absorbing intensity. "Atthis moment we are not only trying to solve the Land question, butthe question of Social Revolution-not only here in Russia, but allover the world. The Land question cannot be solved independently ofthe other problems of the Social Revolution.... For example, theconfiscation of the landed estates will provoke the resistance notonly of Russian land-owners, but also of foreign capital-with whomthe great landed properties are connected through the intermediaryof the banks...."The ownership of the land in Russia is the basis for immenseoppression, and the confiscation of the land by the peasants is themost important step of our Revolution. But it cannot be separatedfrom the other steps, as is clearly manifested by the stages throughwhich the Revolution has had to pass. The first stage was thecrushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of theindustrial capitalists and land-owners, whose interests are closelyrelated. The second stage was the strengthening of the Soviets andthe political compromise with the bourgeoisie. The mistake of theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries lies in the fact that at that timethey did not oppose the policy of compromise, because they held thetheory that the consciousness of the masses was not yet fullydeveloped...._"If Socialism can only be realised when the intellectualdevelopment of all the people permits it, then we shall not seeSocialism for at least five hundred years_.... The Socialist politicalparty-this is the vanguard of the working-class; it must not allowitself to be halted by the lack of education of the mass average,but it must lead the masses, using the Soviets as organs ofrevolutionary initiative.... But in order to lead the wavering, thecomrades Left Socialist Revolutionaries themselves must stophesitating...."In July last a series of open breaks began between the popularmasses and the 'compromisers'; but now, in November, the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries are still holding out their hand toAvksentiev, who is pulling the people with his little finger.... IfCompromise continues, the Revolution disappears. No compromise withthe bourgeoisie is possible; its power must be absolutely crushed...."We Bolsheviki have not changed our Land programme; we have notgiven up the abolition of private property in the land, and we donot intend to do so. We adopted the Regulations for LandCommittees,-which are _not_ based on private property at all-becausewe want to accomplish the popular will in the way the people havethemselves decided to do it, so as to draw closer the coalition ofall the elements who are fighting for the Social Revolution."We invite the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to enter thatcoalition, insisting, however, that they cease looking backward, andthat they break with the 'conciliators' of their party...."As far as the Constituent Assembly is concerned, it is true, as thepreceding speaker has said, that the work of the Constituent willdepend on the revolutionary determination of the masses. I say,'Count on that revolutionary determination, but don't forget yourgun!'"Lenin then read the Bolshevik resolution:The Peasants' Congress, fully supporting the Land decree of November8th... approves of the Provisional Workers' and Peasants' Governmentof the Russian Republic, established by the second All-RussianCongress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.The Peasants' Congress... invites all peasants unanimously to sustainthat law, and to apply it immediately themselves; and at the sametime invites the peasants to appoint to posts and positions ofresponsibility only persons who have proved, not by words but byacts, their entire devotion to the interests of the exploitedpeasant-workers, their desire and their ability to defend theseinterests against all resistance on the part of the greatland-owners, the capitalists, their partisans and accomplices....The Peasants' Congress, at the same time, expresses its convictionthat the complete realisation of all the measures which make up theLand decree can only be successful through the triumph of theWorkers' Social Revolution, which began November 7th, 1917; for onlythe Social Revolution can accomplish the definite transfer, withoutpossibility of return, of the land to the peasant-workers, theconfiscation of model farms and their surrender to the peasantcommunes, the confiscation of agricultural machinery belonging tothe great land-owners, the safe-guarding of the interests of theagricultural workers by the complete abolition of wage-slavery, theregular and methodical distribution among all regions of Russia ofthe products of agriculture and industry, and the seizure of thebanks (without which the possession of land by the whole peoplewould be impossible, after the abolition of private property), andall sorts of assistance by the State to the workers....For these reasons the Peasants' Congress sustains entirely theRevolution of November 7th... as a social revolution, and expressesits unalterable will to put into operation, with whatevermodifications are necessary, but without any hesitation, the socialtransformation of the Russian Republic.The indispensable conditions of the victory of the SocialRevolution, which alone will secure the lasting success and thecomplete realisation of the Land decree, is the close union of thepeasant-workers with the industrial working-class, with theproletariat of all advanced countries. From now on, in the RussianRepublic, all the organisation and administration of the State, fromtop to bottom, must rest on that union. That union, crushing allattempts, direct or indirect, open or dissimulated, to return to thepolicy of conciliation with the bourgeoisie-conciliation, damned byexperience, with the chiefs of bourgeois politics-can alone insurethe victory of Socialism throughout the world....The reactionaries of the Executive Committee no longer dared openlyto appear. Tchernov, however, spoke several times, with a modest andwinning impartiality. He was invited to sit on the platform.... On thesecond night of the Congress an anonymous note was handed up to thechairman, requesting that Tchernov be made honorary President.Ustinov read the note aloud, and immediately Zinoviev was on hisfeet, screaming that this was a trick of the old Executive Committeeto capture the convention; in a moment the hall was one bellowingmass of waving arms and angry faces, on both sides.... Nevertheless,Tchernov remained very popular.In the stormy debates on the Land question and the Lenin resolution,the Bolsheviki were twice on the point of quitting the assembly,both times restrained by their leaders.... It seemed to me as if theCongress were hopelessly deadlocked.But none of us knew that a series of secret conferences were alreadygoing on between the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and theBolsheviki at Smolny. At first the Left Socialist Revolutionarieshad demanded that there be a Government composed of all theSocialist parties in and out of the Soviets, to be responsible to aPeople's Council, composed of an equal number of delegates from theWorkers' and Soldiers' organisation, and that of the Peasants, andcompleted by representatives of the City Dumas and the Zemstvos;Lenin and Trotzky were to be eliminated, and the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee and other repressive organs dissolved.Wednesday morning, November 28th, after a terrible all-nightstruggle, an agreement was reached. The _Tsay-ee-kah,_composed of108 members, was to be augumented by 108 members electedproportionally from the Peasants' Congress; by 100 delegates electeddirectly from the Army and the Fleet; and by 50 representatives ofthe Trade Unions (35 from the general Unions, 10 Railway Workers,and 5 from the Post and Telegraph Workers). The Dumas and Zemstvoswere dropped. Lenin and Trotzky remained in the Government, and theMilitary Revolutionary Committee continued to function.The sessions of the Congress had now been removed to the ImperialLaw School building, Fontanka 6, headquarters of the Peasants'Soviets. There in the great meeting-hall the delegates gathered onWednesday afternoon. The old Executive Committee had withdrawn, andwas holding a rump convention of its own in another room of the samebuilding, made up of bolting delegates and representatives of theArmy Committees.Tchernov went from one meeting to the other, keeping a watchful eyeon the proceedings. He knew that an agreement with the Bolshevikiwas being discussed, but he did not know that it had been concluded.He spoke to the rump convention. "At present, when everybody is infavour of forming an all-Socialist Government, many people forgetthe first Ministry, which was _not_ a coalition Government, and inwhich there was only one Socialist-Kerensky; a Government which, inits time, was very popular. Now people accuse Kerensky; they forgetthat he was raised to power, not only by the Soviets, but also bythe popular masses...."Why did public opinion change toward Kerensky? The savages set upgods to which they pray, and which they punish if one of theirprayers is not answered.... That is what is happening at this moment....Yesterday Kerensky; today Lenin and Trotzky; another to-morrow...."We have proposed to both Kerensky and the Bolsheviki to retire fromthe power. Kerensky has accepted-to-day he announced from hishiding-place that he has resigned as Premier; but the Bolshevikiwish to retain the power, and they do not know how to use it...."If the Bolsheviki succeed, or if they fail, the fate of Russia willnot be changed. The Russian villages understand perfectly what theywant, and they are now carrying out their own measures.... Thevillages will save us in the end...."In the meanwhile, in the great hall Ustinov had announced theagreement between the Peasants' Congress and Smolny, received by thedelegates with the wildest joy. Suddenly Tchernov appeared, anddemanded the floor."I understand," he began, "that an agreement is being concludedbetween the Peasants' Congress and Smolny. Such an agreement wouldbe illegal, seeing that the true Congress of Peasants' Soviets doesnot meet until next week...."Moreover, I want to warn you now that the Bolsheviki will neveraccept your demands...."He was interrupted by a great burst of laughter; and realising thesituation, he left the platform and the room, taking his popularitywith him....Late in the afternoon of Thursday, November 16th, the Congress metin extraordinary session. There was a holiday feeling in the air; onevery face was a smile.... The remainder of the business before theassembly was hurried through, and then old Nathanson, thewhite-bearded dean of the left wing of the SocialistRevolutionaries, his voice trembling and tears in his eyes, read thereport of the "wedding" of the Peasants' Soviets with the Workers'and Soldiers' Soviets. At every mention of the word "union" therewas ecstatic applause.... At the end Ustinov announced the arrivalrival of a delegation from Smolny, accompanied by representatives ofthe Red Army, greeted with a rising ovation. One after another aworkman, a soldier and a sailor took the floor, hailing them.Then Boris Reinstein, delegate of the American Socialist LaborParty: "The day of the union of the Congress of Peasants and theSoviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies is one of the great daysof the Revolution. The sound of it will ring with resounding echoesthroughout the whole world-in Paris, in London, and across theocean-in New York. This union will fill with happiness the hearts ofall toilers."A great idea has triumphed. The West, and America, expected fromRussia, from the Russian proletariat, something tremendous.... Theproletariat of the world is waiting for the Russian Revolution,waiting for the great things that it is accomplishing...."Sverdlov, president of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ greeted them. And with theshout, "Long live the end of civil war! Long live the UnitedDemocracy!" the peasants poured out of the building.It was already dark, and on the ice-covered snow glittered the palelight of moon and star. Along the bank of the canal were drawn up infull marching order the soldiers of the Pavlovsky Regiment, withtheir band, which broke into the _Marseillaise._ Amid the crashingfull-throated shouts of the soldiers, the peasants formed in line,unfurling the great red banner of the Executive Committee of theAll-Russian Peasants' Soviets, embroidered newly in gold, "Long livethe union of the revolutionary and toiling masses!" Following wereother banners; of the District Soviets-of Putilov Factory, whichread, "We bow to this flag in order to create the brotherhood of allpeople!"From somewhere torches appeared, blazing orange in the night, athousand times reflected in the facets of the ice, streaming outsmokily over the throng as it moved down the bank of the Fontankasinging, between crowds that stood in astonished silence."Long live the Revolutionary Army! Long live the Red Guard! Longlive the Peasants!"So the great procession wound through the city, growing andunfurling ever new red banners lettered in gold. Two old peasants,bowed with toil, were walking hand in hand, their faces illuminedwith child-like bliss."Well," said one, "I'd like to see them take away our land again,_now!_Near Smolny the Red Guard was lined up on both sides of the street,wild with delight. The other old peasant spoke to his comrade, "I amnot tired," he said. "I walked on air all the way!"On the steps of Smolny about a hundred Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies were massed, with their banner, dark against the blaze oflight streaming out between the arches. Like a wave they rusheddown, clasping the peasants in their arms and kissing them; and theprocession poured in through the great door and up the stairs, witha noise like thunder....In the immense white meeting-room the _Tsay-ee-kah_ was waiting,with the whole Petrograd Soviet and a thousand spectators beside,with that solemnity which attends great conscious moments in history.Zinoviev announced the agreement with the Peasants' Congress, to ashaking roar which rose and burst into storm as the sound of musicblared down the corridor, and the head of the procession came in. Onthe platform the presidium rose and made place for the Peasants'presidium, the two embracing; behind them the two banners wereintertwined against the white wall, over the empty frame from whichthe Tsar's picture had been torn....Then opened the "triumphal session." After a few words of welcomefrom Sverdlov, Maria Spiridonova, slight, pale, with spectacles andhair drawn flatly down, and the air of a New England school-teacher,took the tribune-the most loved and the most powerful woman in allRussia."... Before the workers of Russia open now horizons which history hasnever known.... All workers' movements in the past have been defeated.But the present movement is international, and that is why it isinvincible. There is no force in the world which can put out thefire of the Revolution! The old world crumbles down, the new worldbegins...."Then Trotzky, full of fire: "I wish you welcome, comrades peasants!You come here not as guests, but as masters of this house, whichholds the heart of the Russian Revolution. The will of millions ofworkers is now concentrated in this hall.... There is now only onemaster of the Russian land: the union of the workers, soldiers andpeasants...."With biting sarcasm he went on to speak of the Allied diplomats,till then contemptuous of Russia's invitation to an armistice, whichhad been accepted by the Central Powers."A new humanity will be born of this war.... In this hall we swear toworkers of all lands to remain at our revolutionary post. If we arebroken, then it will be in defending our flag...."Krylenko followed him, explaining the situation at the front, whereDukhonin was preparing to resist the Council of People's Commissars."Let Dukhonin and those with him understand well that we shall notdeal gently with those who bar the road to peace!"Dybenko saluted the assembly in the name of the Fleet, andKrushinsky, member of the _Vikzhel,_ said, "From this moment, whenthe union of all true Socialists is realised, the whole army ofrailway workers places itself absolutely at the disposition of therevolutionary democracy!" And Lunatcharsky, almost weeping, andProshian, for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, and finallySaharashvili, for the United Social Democrats Internationalists,composed of members of the Martov's and of Gorky's groups, whodeclared:"We left the _Tsay-ee-kah_ because of the uncompromising policy ofthe Bolsheviki, and to force them to make concessions in order torealise the union of all the revolutionary democracy. Now that thatunion is brought about, we consider it a sacred duty to take ourplaces once more in the _Tsay-ee-kah_.... We declare that all thosewho have withdrawn from the _Tsay-ee-kah_ should now return."Stachkov, a dignified old peasant of the presidium of the Peasants'Congress, bowed to the four corners of the room. "I greet you withthe christening of a new Russian life and freedom!"Gronsky, in the name of the Polish Social Democracy; Skripnik, forthe Factory-Shop Committees; Tifonov, for the Russian soldiers atSalonika; and others, interminably, speaking out of full hearts,with the happy eloquence of hopes fulfilled....It was late in the night when the following resolution was put andpassed unanimously:"The _Tsay-ee-kah,_ united in extraordinary session with thePetrograd Soviet and the Peasants' Congress, confirms the Land andPeace decrees adopted by the second Congress of Soviets of Workers'and Soldiers' Deputies, and also the decree on Workers' Controladopted by the _Tsay-ee-kah._"The joint session of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and the Peasants' Congressexpresses its firm conviction that the union of workers, soldiersand peasants, this fraternal union of all the workers and allexploited, will consolidate the power conquered by them, that itwill take all revolutionary measures to hasten the passing of thepower into the hands of the working-class in other countries, andthat it will assure in this manner the lasting accomplishment of ajust peace and the victory of Socialism."(See App. XI, Sect. 2)                        APPENDIX TO CHAPTER I                                 1._Oborontsi_—“Defenders.” All the “moderate” Socialist groups adoptedor were given this name, because they consented to the continuationof the war under Allied leadership, on the ground that it was a warof National Defence. The Bolsheviki, the Left SocialistRevolutionaries, the Mensheviki Internationalists (Martov’s faction),and the Social Democrats Internationalists (Gorky’s group) were infavour of forcing the Allies to declare democratic war-aims, and tooffer peace to Germany on those terms….                                  2.

On an average, wagesincreased slightly more than 500 per cent….But at the same time the value of the ruble fell to less thanone-third its former purchasing power, and the cost of thenecessities of

         |+-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+On an average, the above categories of necessities increased about1,109 per cent in price, more than twice the increase of salaries.The difference, of course, went into the pockets of speculators andmerchants.In September, 1917, when I arrived in Petrograd, the average dailywage of a skilled industrial worker—for example, a steel-worker inthe Putilov Factory—was about 8 rubles. At the same time, profitswere enormous…. I was told by one of the owners of the ThorntonWoollen Mills, an English concern on the outskirts of Petrograd, thatwhile wages had increased about 300 per cent in his factory, hisprofits had gone up _900 per cent._                                 3.                        THE SOCIALIST MINISTERSThe history of the efforts of the Socialists in the ProvisionalGovernment of July to realise their programme in coalition with thebourgeois Ministers, is an illuminating example of class struggle inpolitics. Says Lenin, in explanation of this phenomenon:“The capitalists, … seeing that the position of the Government wasuntenable, resorted to a method which since 1848 has been for decadespractised by the capitalists in order to befog, divide, and finallyoverpower the working-class. This method is the so-called ‘CoalitionMinistry,’ composed of bourgeois and of renegades from the Socialistcamp.“In those countries where political freedom and democracy haveexisted side by side with the revolutionary movement of theworkers—for example in England and France—the capitalists make use ofthis subterfuge, and very successfully too. The ‘Socialist’ leaders,upon entering the Ministries, invariably prove mere figure-heads,puppets, simply a shield for the capitalists, a tool with which todefraud the workers. The ‘democratic’ and ‘republican’ capitalists inRussia set in motion this very same scheme. The SocialistRevolutionaries and Mensheviki fell victim to it, and on June 1st a‘Coalition’ Ministry, with the participation of Tchernov, Tseretelli,Skobeliev, Avksentiev, Savinkov, Zarudny and Nikitin became anaccomplished fact….”—_Problems of the Revolution._                                 4.                SEPTEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN MOSCOWIn the first week of October, 1917, _Novaya Zhizn_ published thefollowing comparative table of election results, pointing out thatthis meant the bankruptcy of the policy of Coalition with thepropertied classes. “If civil war can yet be avoided, it can only bedone by a united front of all the revolutionary democracy….”_Elections for the Moscow Central and Ward Dumas_.

GROWING ARROGANCE OF THE REACTIONARIESSeptember 18th. The Cadet Shulgin, writing in a Kiev newspaper, saidthat the Provisional Government’s declaration that Russia was aRepublic constituted a gross abuse of its powers. “We cannot admiteither a Republic, or the present Republican Government…. And we arenot sure that we want a Republic in Russia….”October 23d. At a meeting of the Cadet party held at Riazan, M.Dukhonin declared, “On March 1st we must establish a ConstitutionalMonarchy. We must not reject the legitimate heir to the throne,Mikhail Alexandrovitch….”October 27th. Resolution passed by the Conference of Business Men atMoscow:“The Conference… insists that the Provisional Government take thefollowing immediate measures in the Army:“1. Forbidding of all political propaganda; the Army must be out ofpolitics.“2. Propaganda of antinational and international ideas and theoriesdeny the necessity for armies, and hurt discipline; it should beforbidden, and all propagandists punished….“3. The function of the Army Committees must be limited to economicquestions exclusively. All their decisions should be confirmed bytheir superior officers, who have the right to dissolve theCommittees at any time….“4. The salute to be reestablished, and made obligatory. Fullreestablishment of disciplinary power in the hands of officers, withright of review of sentence….“5. Expulsion from the Corps of Officers of those who dishonour it byparticipating in the movement of the soldier-masses, which teachesthem disobedience…. Reestablishment for this purpose of the Courts ofHonor….“6. The Provisional Government should take the necessary measures tomake possible the return to the army of Generals and other officersunjustly discharged under the influence of Committees, and otherirresponsible organisations….”                       APPENDIX TO CHAPTER II                                 1.The Kornilov revolt is treated in detail in my forthcoming volume,“Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk.” The responsibility of Kerensky for thesituation which gave rise to Kornilov’s attempt is now pretty clearlyestablished. Many apologists for Kerensky say that he knew ofKornilov’s plans, and by a trick drew him out prematurely, and thencrushed him. Even Mr. A. J. Sack, in his book, “The Birth of theRussian Democracy,” says:“Several things… are almost certain. The first is that Kerensky knewabout the movement of several detachments from the Front towardPetrograd, and it is possible that as Prime Minister and Minister ofWar, realising the growing Bolshevist danger, he called for them….”The only flaw in that argument is that there was no “Bolshevistdanger” at that time, the Bolsheviki still being a powerless minorityin the Soviets, and their leaders in jail or hiding.                                 2.                        DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCEWhen the Democratic Conference was first proposed to Kerensky, hesuggested an assembly of all the elements in the nation—“the liveforces,” as he called them—including bankers, manufacturers,land-owners, and representatives of the Cadet party. The Sovietrefused, and drew up the following table of representation, whichKerensky agreed to:+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 100 delegates | All-Russian Soviets Workers’ and Soldiers’         ||               | Deputies                                           |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 100 delegates | All-Russian Soviets Peasants’ Deputies             |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 50 delegates  | Provincial Soviets Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 50 delegates  | Peasants’ District Land Committees                 |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 100 delegates | Trade Unions                                       |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 84 delegates  | Army Committees at the Front                       |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 150 delegates | Workers’ and Peasants’ Cooperative Societies       |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 20 delegates  | Railway Workers’ Union                             |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 10 delegates  | Post and Telegraph Workers’ Union                  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 20 delegates  | Commercial Clerks                                  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 15 delegates  | Liberal Professions—Doctors, Lawyers,              ||               | Journalists, etc.                                  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 50 delegates  | Provincial Zemstvos                                |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 59 delegates  | Nationalist Organisations—Poles, Ukraineans, etc.  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+This proportion was altered twice or three times.

THE FUNCTION OF THE SOVIETS IS ENDEDOn September 28th, 1917, _Izviestia,_ organ of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_published an article which said, speaking of the last ProvisionalMinistry:“At last a truly democratic government, born of the will of allclasses of the Russian people, the first rough form of the futureliberal parliamentary régime, has been formed. Ahead of us is theConstituent Assembly, which will solve all questions of fundamentallaw, and whose composition will be essentially democratic. Thefunction of the Soviets is at an end, and the time is approachingwhen they must retire, with the rest of the revolutionary machinery,from the stage of a free and victorious people, whose weapons shallhereafter be the peaceful ones of political action.”The leading article of _Izviestia_ for October 23d was called, “TheCrisis in the Soviet Organisations.” It began by saying thattravellers reported a lessening activity of local Soviets everywhere.“This is natural,” said the writer. “For the people are becominginterested in the more permanent legislative organs—the MunicipalDumas and the Zemstvs….“In the important centres of Petrograd and Moscow, where the Sovietswere best organised, they did not take in all the democraticelements…. The majority of the intellectuals did not participate, andmany workers also; some of the workers because they were politicallybackward, others because the centre of gravity for them was in theirUnns…. We cannot deny that these organisations are firmly united withthe masses, whose everyday needs are better served by them….“That the local democratic administrations are being energeticallyorganised is highly important. The City Dumas are elected byuniversal suffrage, and in purely local matters have more authoritythan the Soviets. Not a single democrat will see anything wrong inthis….“… Elections to the Municipalities are being conduct in a better andmore democratic way than the elections to the Soviets… All classesare represented in the Municipalities…. And as soon as the localSelf-Governments begin to organise life in the Municipalities, therôle of the local Soviets naturally ends….“… There are two factors in the falling off of interest in theSoviets. The first we may attribute to the lowering of politicalinterest in the masses; the second, to the growing effort ofprovincial and local governing bodies to organise the building of newRussia…. The more the tendency lies in this latter direction, thesooner disappears the significance of the Soviets….“We ourselves are being called the ‘undertakers’ of our ownorganisation. In reality, we ourselves are the hardest workers inconstructing the new Russia….“When autocracy and the whole bureaucratic règimeell, we set up theSoviets as a barracks in which all the democracy cod find temporaryshelter. Now, instead of barracks, we are building the permanentedifice of a new system, and naturally the people will graduallyleave the barracks for more comfortable quarters.”                                 4.        TROTZKY’S SPEECH AT THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIN REPUBLIC“The purpose of the Democratic Conference, which was called by the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ was to do away with the irresponsible personalgovernment which produced Kornilov, and to establish a responsiblegovernment which would be capable of finishing the war, and ensurethe calling of the Constituent Assembly at the given time. In themeanwhile behind the back of the Democratic Conference, by trickery,by deals between Citizen Kerensky, the Cadets, and the leaders of theMenshevik and Socialist Revolutionary parties, we received theopposite result from the officially announced purpose. A power wascreated around which and in which we have open and secret Kornilovsplaying leading parts. The irresponsibility of the Government isoffically proclaimed, when it is announced that the Council of theRussian Republic is to be a _consultative_ and not _legislative_body. In the eighth month of the Revolution, the irresponsibleGovernment creates a cover for itself in this new edition ofBieligen’s Duma.“The propertied classes have entered this Provision Council in aproportion which clearly shows, from elections all over the country,that many of them have no right here whatever. In spite of that theCadet party, which until yesterday wanted the Provisional Governmentto be responsible to the State Duma—this same Cadet party secured theindependence Assembly the propertied classes will no doubt have asfavourable position than they have in this Council, and they will notbe able to be irresponsible to the Constituent Assembly.“If the propertied classes were really getting ready for theConstituent Assembly six weeks from now, there could be no reason forestablishing the irresponsibility of the Government at this time. Thewhole truth is that the bourgeoisie, which directs the policies ofthe Provisional Government, has for its aim to break the ConstituentAssembly. At present this is the main purpose of the propertiedclasses, which control our entire national policy—external andinternal. In the industrial, agrarian and supply departments thepolitics of the propertied classes, acting with the Government,increases the natural disorganisation caused by the war. Thepropertied classes, which are provoking a peasants’ revolt! Thepropertied classes, which are provoking civil war, and openly holdtheir course on the bony hand of hunger, with which they intend tooverthrow the Revolution and finish with the Constituent Assembly!“No less criminal also is the international policy of the bourgeoisieand its Government. After forty months of war, the capital isthreatened with mortal danger. In reply to this arises a plan to movethe Government to Moscow. The idea of abandoning the capital does notstir the indignation of the bourgeoisie. Just the opposite. It isaccepted as a natural part of the general policy designed to promotecounter-revolutionary conspiracy. … Instead of recognising that thesalvation of the country lies in concluding peace, instead ofthrowing openly the idea of immediate peace to all the worn-outpeoples, over the heads of diplomats and imperialists, and making thecontinuation of the war impossible,—the Provisional Government, byorder of the Cadets, the Counter-Revolutionists and the AlliedImperialists, without sense, without purpose and without a plan,continues to drag on the murderous war, sentencing to useless deathnew hundreds of thousands of soldiers and sailors, and preparing togive up Petrograd, and to wreck the Revolution. At a time whenBolshevik soldiers and sailors are dying with other soldiers andsailors as a result of the mistakes and crimes of others, theso-called Supreme Commander (Kerensky) continues to suppress theBolshevik press. The leading parties of the Council are acting as avoluntary cover for these policies.“We, the faction of Social Democrats Bolsheviki, announce that withthis Government of Treason to the People we have nothing in common.We have nothing in common with the work of these Murderers of thePeople which goes on behind official curtains. We refuse eitherdirectly or indirectly to cover up one day of this work. WhileWilhelm’s troops are threatening Petrograd, the Government ofKerensky and Kornilov is preparing to run away from Petrograd andturn Moscow into a base of counter-revolution!“We warn the Moscow workers and soldiers to be on their guard.Leaving this Council, we appeal to the manhood and wisdom of theworkers, peasants and soldiers of all Russia. Petrograd is in danger!The Revolution is in danger! The Government has increased thedanger—the ruling classes intensify it. Only the people themselvescan save themselves and the country.“We appeal to the people. Long live immediate, honest, democraticpeace! All power to the Soviets! All land to the people! Long livethe Constituent Assembly!”                                 5.                        THE “NAKAZ” TO SKOBELIEV                                _Resumé_(Passed by the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and given to Skobeliev as an instructionfor the representative of the Russian Revolutionary democracy at theParis Conference.)The peace treaty must be based on the principle, “No annexations, noindemnities, the right of self-determination of peoples.”                _Territorial Problems_(1) Evacuation of German troops from invaded Russia. Full right ofself-determination to Poland, Lithuania and Livonia.(2) For Turkish Armenia autonomy, and later completeself-determination, as soon as local Governments are established.(3) The question of Alsace-Lorraine to be solved by a plebiscite,after the withdrawal of all foreign troops.(4) Belgium to be restored. Compensation for damages from aninternational fund.(5) Serbia and Montenegro to be restored, and aided by aninternational relief fund. Serbia to have an outlet on the Adriatic.Bosnia and Herzegovina to be autonomous.(6) The disputed provinces in the Balkans to have provisionalautonomy, followed by a plebiscite.(7) Rumania to be restored, but forced to give completeself-determination to the Dobrudja…. Rumania must be forced toexecute the clauses of the Berlin Treaty concerning the Jews, andrecognise them as Rumanian citizens.(8) In Italia Irridenta a provisional autonomy, followed by aplebiscite to determine state dependence.(9) The German colonies to be returned.(10) Greece and Persia to be restored.                _Freedom of the Seas_All straits opening into inland seas, as well as the Suez and PanamaCanals, are to be neutralised. Commercial shipping to be free. Theright of privateering to be abolished. The torpedoing of commercialships to be forbidden.                _Indemnities_All combatants to renounce demands for any indemnities, either director indirect—as, for instance, charges for the maintenance ofprisoners. Indemnities and contributions collected during the warmust be refunded.                _Economic Terms_Commercial treaties are not to be a part of the peace terms. Everycountry must be independent in its commercial relations, and must notbe obliged to, or prevented from, concluding an economic treaty, bythe Treaty of Peace. Nevertheless, all nations should bindthemselves, by the Peace Treaty, not to practise an economic blockadeafter the war, nor to form separate tariff agreements. The right ofmost favoured nation must be given to all countries withoutdistinction.                _Guarantees of Peace_Peace is to be concluded at the Peace Conference by delegates electedby the national representative institutions of each country. Thepeace terms are to be confirmed by these parliaments.Secret diplomacy is to be abolished; all parties are to bindthemselves not to conclude any secret treaties. Such treaties aredeclared in contradiction to international law, and void. Alltreaties, until confirmed by the parliaments of the differentnations, are to be considered void.Gradual disarmament both on land and sea, and the establishment of amilitia system. The “League of Nations” advanced by President Wilsonmay become a valuable aid to international law, provided that (a),all nations are to be obliged to participate in it with equal rights,and (b), international politics are to be democratised.                _Ways to Peace_The Allies are to announce immediately that they are willing to openpeace negotiations as soon as the enemy powers declare their consentto the renunciation of all forcible annexations.The Allies must bind themselves not to begin any peace negotiations,nor to conclude peace, except in a general Peace Conference with theparticipation of delegates from all the neutral countries.All obstacles to the Stockholm Socialist Conference are to beremoved, and passports are to be given immediately to all delegatesof parties and organisations who wish to participate.(The Executive Committee of the Peasants’ Soviets also issued a_nakaz,_ which differs little from the above.)                                 6.                        PEACE AT RUSSIA’S EXPENSEThe Ribot revelations of Austria’s peace-offer to France; theso-called “Peace Conference” at Berne, Switzerland, during the summerof 1917, in which delegates participated from all belligerentcountries, representing large financial interests in all thesecountries; and the attempted negotiations of an English agent with aBulgarian church dignitary; all pointed to the fact that there werestrong currents, on both sides, favourable to patching up a peace atthe expense of Russia. In my next book, “Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk,”I intend to treat this matter at some length, publishing severalsecret documents discovered in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs atPetrograd.                                 7.                     RUSSIAN SOLDIERS IN FRANCE_Official Report of the Provisional Government._“From the time the news of the Russian Revolution reached Paris,Russian newspapers of extreme tendencies immediately began to appear;and these newspapers, as well as individuals, freely circulated amongthe soldier masses and began a Bolshevik propaganda, often spreadingfalse news which appeared in the French journals. In the absence ofall official news, and of precise details, this campaign provokeddiscontent among the soldiers. The result was a desire to return toRussia, and a hatred toward the officers.“Finally it all turned into rebellion. In one of their meetings, thesoldiers issued an appeal to refuse to drill, since they had decidedto fight no more. It was decided to isolate the rebels, and GeneralZankievitch ordered all soldiers loyal to the Provisional Governmentto leave the camp of Courtine, and to carry with them all ammunition.On June 25th the order was executed; there remained at the camp onlythe soldiers who said they would submit ‘conditionally’ to theProvisional Government. The soldiers at the camp of Courtine receivedseveral times the visit of the Commander-in-Chief of the RussianArmies abroad, of Rapp, the Commissar of the Ministry of War, and ofseveral distinguished former exiles who wished to influence them, butthese attempts were unsuccessful, and finally Commissar Rapp insistedthat the rebels lay down their arms, and, in sign of submission,march in good order to a place called Clairvaux. The order was onlypartially obeyed; first 500 men went out, of whom 22 were arrested;24 hours later about 6,000 followed…. About 2,000 remained….“It was decided to increase the pressure; their rations werediminished, their pay was cut off, and the roads toward the villageof Courtine were guarded by French soldiers. General Zankievitch,having discovered that a Russian artillery brigade was passingthrough France, decided to form a mixed detachment of infantry andartillery to reduce the rebels. A deputation  was sent to the rebels;the deputation returned several hours later, convinced of thefutility of the negotiations. On September 1st General Zankievitchsent an ultimatum to the rebels demanding that they lay down theirarms, and menacing in case of refusal to open fire with artillery ifthe order was not obeyed by September 3d at 10 o’clock.“The order not being executed, a light fire of artillery was openedon the place at the hour agreed upon. Eighteen shells were fired, andthe rebels were warned that the bombardment would become moreintense. In the night of September 3d 160 men surrendered. September4th the artillery bombardment recommenced, and at 11 o’clock, after36 shells had been fired, the rebels raised two white flags and beganto leave the camp without arms. By evening 8,300 men had surrendered.150 soldiers who remained in the camp opened fire with machine-gunsthat night. The 5th of September, to make an end of the affair, aheavy barrage was laid on the camp, and our soldiers occupied itlittle by little. The rebels kept up a heavy fire with theirmachine-guns. September 6th, at 9 o’clock, the camp was entirelyoccupied…. After the disarmament of the rebels, 81 arrests weremade….”Thus the report. From secret documents discovered in the Ministry ofForeign Affairs, however, we know that the account is not strictlyaccurate. The first trouble arose when the soldiers tried to formCommittees, as their comrades in Russia were doing. They demanded tobe sent back to Russia, which was refused; and then, being considereda dangerous influence in France, they were ordered to Salonika. Theyrefused to go, and the battle followed…. It was discovered that theyhad been left in camp without officers for about two months, andbadly treated, before they became rebellious. All attempts to findout the name of the “Russian artillery brigade” which had fired onthem were futile; the telegrams discovered in the Ministry left it tobe inferred that French artillery was used….After their surrender, more than two hundred of the mutineers wereshot in cold blood.                                 8.                      TERESTCHENKO’S SPEECH_ (Resumé_)“… The questions of foreign policy are closely related to those ofnational defence…. And so, if in questions of national defence youthink it is necessary to hold session in secret, also in our foreignpolicy we are sometimes forced to observe the same secrecy….“German diplomacy attempts to influence public opinion…. Thereforethe declarations of directors of great democratic organisations whotalk loudly of a revolutionary Congress, and the impossibility ofanother winter campaign, are dangerous…. All these declarations costhuman lives….“I wish to speak merely of governmental logic, without touching thequestions of the honour and dignity of the State. From the point ofview of logic, the foreign policy of Russia ought to be based on areal comprehension of the _interests_ of Russia…. These interestsmean that it is impossible that our country remain alone, and thatthe present alignment of forces with us, (the Allies), issatisfactory…. All humanity longs for peace, but in Russia no onewill permit a humiliating peace which would violate the Stateinterests of our fatherland!”The orator pointed out that such a peace would for long years, if notfor centuries, retard the triumph of democratic principles in theworld, and would inevitably cause new wars.“All remember the days of May, when the fraternisation on our Frontthreatened to end the war by a simple cessation of militaryoperations, and lead the country to a shameful separate peace… andwhat efforts it was necessary to use to make the soldier masses atthe front understand that it was not by this method that the RussianState must end the war and guarantee its interest….”He spoke of the miraculous effect of the July offensive, whatstrength it gave to the words of Russian ambassadors abroad, and thedespair in Germany caused by the Russian victories. And also, thedisillusionment in Allied countries which followed the Russiandefeat….“As to the Russian Government, it adhered strictly to the formula ofMay, ‘No annexations and no punitive indemnities.’ We consider itessential not only to proclaim the self-determination of peoples, butalso to renounce imperialist aims….”Germany is continually trying to make peace. The only talk in Germanyis of peace; she knows she cannot win.“I reject the reproaches aimed at the Government which allege thatRussian foreign policy does not speak clearly enough about the aimsof the war….“If the question arises as to what ends the Allies are pursuing, itis indispensable first to demand what aims the Central Powers haveagreed upon….“The desire is often heard that we publish the details of thetreaties which bind the Allies; but people forget that, up to now, wedo not know the treaties which bind the Central Powers….”Germany, he said, evidently wants to separate Russia from the West bya series of weak buffer-states.“This tendency to strike at the vital interests of Russia must bechecked….“And will the Russian democracy, which has inscribed on its bannerthe rights of nations to dispose of themselves, allow calmly thecontinuation of oppression upon the most civilised peoples (inAustria-Hungary)?“Those who fear that the Allies will try to profit by our difficultsituation, to make us support more than our share of the burden ofwar, and to solve the questions of peace at our expense, are entirelymistaken…. Our enemy looks upon Russia as a market for its products.The end of the war will leave us in a feeble condition, and with ourfrontier open the flood of German products can easily hold back foryears our industrial development. Measures must be taken to guardagainst this….“I say openly and frankly: the combination of forces which unites usto the Allies is _favourable to the interests of Russia…._ It istherefore important that our views on the questions of war and peaceshall be in accord with the views of the Allies as clearly andprecisely as possible…. To avoid all misunderstanding, I must sayfrankly that Russia must present at the Paris Conference _one pointof view…._”He did not want to comment on the _nakaz_ to Skobeliev, but hereferred to the Manifesto of the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee, justpublished in Stockholm. This Manifesto declared for the autonomy ofLithuania and Livonia; “but that is clearly impossible,” saidTerestchenko, “for Russia must have free ports on the Baltic all theyear round….“In this question the problems of foreign policy are also closelyrelated to interior politics, for if there existed a strong sentimentof unity of all great Russia, one would not witness the repeatedmanifestations, everywhere, of a desire of peoples to separate fromthe Central Government…. Such separations are contrary to theinterests of Russia, and the Russian delegates cannot raise theissue….”                                 9.                       THE BRITISH FLEET (_etc._)At the time of the naval battle of the Gulf of Riga, not only theBolsheviki, but also the Ministers of the Provisional Government,considered  that the British Fleet had deliberately abandoned theBaltic, as one indication of the attitude so often expressed publiclyby the British press, and semi-publicly by British representatives inRussia, “Russia’s finished! No use bothering about Russia!”See interview with Kerensky (Appendix 13).GENERAL GURKO was a former Chief of Staff of the Russian armies underthe Tsar. He was a prominent figure in the corrupt Imperial Court.After the Revolution, he was one of the very few persons exiled forhis political and personal record. The Russian naval defeat in theGulf of Riga coincided with the public reception, by King George inLondon, of General Gurko, a man whom the Russian ProvisionalGovernment considered dangerously pro-German as well as reactionary!                                10.                     APPEALS AGAINST INSURRECTION                        _To Workers and Soldiers_“Comrades! The Dark Forces are increasingly trying to call forth inPetrograd and other towns DISORDERS AND _Pogroms._ Disorder isnecessary to the Dark Forces, for disorder will give them anopportunity for crushing the revolutionary movement in blood. Underthe pretext of establishing order, and of protecting the inhabitants,they hope to establish the domination of Kornilov, which therevolutionary people succeeded in suppressing not long ago. Woe tothe people if these hopes are realised! The triumphantcounter-revolution will destroy the Soviets and the Army Committees,will disperse the Constituent Assembly, will stop the transfer of theland to the Land Committees, will put an end to all the hopes of thepeople for a speedy peace, and will fill all the prisons withrevolutionary soldiers and workers.“In their calculations, the counter-revolutionists and Black Hundredleaders are counting on the serious discontent of the unenlightenedpart of the people with the disorganisation of the food-supply, thecontinuation of the war, and the general difficulties of life. Theyhope to transform every demonstration of soldiers and workers into a_pogrom,_ which will frighten the peaceful population and throw itinto the arms of the Restorers of Law and Order.“Under such conditions every attempt to organise a demonstration inthese days, although for the most laudable object, would be a crime.All conscious workers and soldiers who are displeased with the policyof the Government will only bring injury to themselves and to theRevolution if they indulge in demonstrations.“THEREFORE THE _Tsay-ee-kah_ ASKS ALL WORKERS NOT TO OBEY ANY CALLSTO DEMONSTRATE.“WORKERS AND SOLDIERS! DO NOT YIELD TO PROVOCATION! REMEMBER YOURDUTY TO YOUR COUNTRY AND TO THE REVOLUTION! DO NOT BREAK THE UNITY OFTHE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT BY DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH ARE BOUND TO BEUNSUCCESSFUL!”_The Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Workers’ andSoldiers’ Deputies (Tsay-ee-kah)__Russian Social Democratic Labour Party_THE DANGER IS NEAR!To All Workers and Soldiers(_Read and Hand to Others_)_Comrades Workers and Soldiers!_“Our country is in danger. On account of this danger our freedom andour Revolution are passing through difficult days. The enemy is atthe gates of Petrograd. The disorganisation is growing with everyhours. It becomes more and more difficult to obtain bread forPetrograd. All, of from the smallest to the greatest, must redoubletheir efforts, must endeavour to arrange things properly…. We mustsave our country, say freedom…. More arms and provisions for theArmy! Bread—for the great cities. Order and organisation in thecountry….“And in these terrible critical days rumours creep about thatSOMEWHERE a demonstration is being prepared, that SOME ONE is callingon the soldiers and workers to destroy revolutionary peace andorder…. _Rabotchi Put,_ the newspaper of the Bolsheviki, is pouringoil on the flames: it flattering, trying to please the unenlightenedpeople, tempting the worker and soldiers, urging them on against theGovernment, promising them mountains of good things…. The confiding,ignorant men believe, they do not reason…. And from the other sidecome also rumours—rumours that the Dark Forces, the friends of theTsar, the German spies, are rubbing their hands with glee. They areready to join the Bolsheviki, and with them fan the disorders intocivil war.“The Bolsheviki and the ignorant soldiers and workers seduced by themcry senselessly: ‘Down with the Government! All power to theSoviets!’ And the Dark servants of the Tsar and the spies of Wilhelmwill egg the on; ‘Beat the Jews, beat the shopkeepers, rob themarkets, devastate the shops, pillage the wine stores! Slay, burn,rob!’“And then will begin a terrible confusion, a war between one part ofthe people and the other. All will become still more disorganised,and perhaps once more blood will be shed on the streets of thecapital. And then what then?“Then, the road to Petrograd will be open to Wilhelm. Then, no breadwill come to Petrograd, the children will die of hunger. Then, theArmy as the front will remain without support, our brothers in thetrenches will be delivered to the fire of the enemy. Then, Russiawill lose all prestige in other countries, our money will lose itsvalue; everything will be so dear as to make life impossible. Then,the long awaited Constituent Assembly will be postponed—it will beimpossible to convene it in time. And then—Death to the Revolution,Death to our Liberty….“Is it this that you want, workers and soldiers? No! If you do notthen go, go to the ignorant people seduced by the betrayers, and tellthem the whole truth, which we have told you!“Let all know that EVERY MAN WHO IN THESE TERRIBLE DAYS CALLS ON YOUTO COME OUT IN THE STREETS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, IS EITHER A SECRETSERVANT OF THE TSAR, A PROVOCATOR, OR AN UNWISE ASSISTANT OF THEENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE, OR A PAID SPY OF WILHELM!“Every conscious worker revolutionist, every conscious peasant, everyrevolutionary soldier, all who understand what harm a demonstrationor a revolt against the Government might cause to the people, mustjoin together and not allow the enemies of the people to destroy ourfreedom.”_The Petrograd Electoral Committee of the Mensheviki-oborontzi._                                11.                    LENIN’s “LETTER TO THE COMRADES”This series of articles appeared in _Rabotchi Put_ several daysrunning, at the end of October and beginning of November, 1917. Igive here only extracts from two instalments:1. Kameniev and Riazanov say that we have not a majority among thepeople, and that without a majority insurrection is hopeless.“Answer: People capable of speaking such things are falsifiers,pedants, or simply don’t want to look the real situation in the face.In the last elections we received in all the country more than fiftyper cent of all thevotes….“The most important thing in Russia to-day is the peasants’revolution. In Tambov Government there has been a real agrarianuprising with wonderful political results…. Even _Dielo Naroda_ hasbeen scared into yelling that the land must be turned over to thepeasants, and not only the Socialist Revolutionaries in the Councilof the Republic, but also the Government itself, has been similarlyaffected. Another valuable result was the bringing of bread which hadbeen hoarded by the _pomieshtchiki_ to the railroad stations in thatprovince. The _Russkaya Volia_ had to admit that the stations werefilled with bread after the peasants’ rising….“2. We are not sufficiently strong to take over the Government, andthe bourgeoisie is not sufficiently strong to prevent the ConstituentAssembly.“Answer: This is nothing but timidity, expressed by pessimism asregards workers and soldiers, and optimism as regards the failure ofthe bourgeoisie. If _yunkers_ and Cossacks say they will fight, youbelieve them; if workmen and soldiers say so, you doubt it. What isthe distinction between such doubts and siding politically with thebourgeoisie?“Kornilov proved that the Soviets were really a power. To believeKerensky and the Council of the Republic, if the bourgeoisie is notstrong enough to break the Soviets, it is not strong enough to breakthe Constituent. But that is wrong. The bourgeoisie will break theConstituent by sabotage, by lock-outs, by giving up Petrograd, byopening the front to the Germans. This has already been done in thecase of Riga….“3. The Soviets must remain a revolver at the head of the Governmentto force the calling of the Constituent Assembly, and to suppress anyfurther Kornilov attempts.“Answer: Refusal of insurrection is refusal of ‘All Power to theSoviets.’ Since September the Bolshevik party has been discussing thequestion of insurrection. Refusing to rise means to trust our hopesin the faith of the good bourgeoisie, who have ‘promised’ to call theConstituent Assembly. When the Soviets have all the power, thecalling of the Constituent is guaranteed, and its success assured.“Refusal of insurrection means surrender to the ‘Lieber-Dans.’ Eitherwe must drop ‘All Power to the Soviets’ or make an insurrection;there is no middle course.”“4. The bourgeoisie cannot give up Petrograd, although the Rodziankoswant it, because it is not the bourgeoisie who are fighting, but ourheroic soldiers and sailors.“Answer: This did not prevent two admirals from running away at theMoonsund battle. The Staff has not changed; it is composed ofKornilovtsi. If the Staff, with Kerensky at its head, wants to giveup Petrograd, it can do it doubly or trebly. It can make arrangementswith the Germans or the British; open the fronts. It can sabotage theArmy’s food supply. At all these doors has it knocked.“We have no right to wait until the bourgeoisie chokes theRevolution. Rodzianko is a man of action, who has faithfully andtruthfully served the bourgeoisie for years…. Half the Lieber-Dansare cowardly compromisers; half of them simple fatalists….”“5. We’re getting stronger every day. We shall be able to enter theConstituent Assembly as a strong opposition. Then why should we playeverything on one card?”“Answer: This is the argument of a sophomore with no practicalexperience, who reads that the Constituent Assembly is being calledand trustfully accepts the legal and constitutional way. Even thevoting of the Constituent Assembly will not do away with hunger, orbeat Wilhelm…. The issue of hunger and of surrendering Petrogradcannot be decided by waiting for the Constituent Assembly. Hunger isnot waiting. The peasants’ Revolution is not waiting. The Admiralswho ran away did not wait.“Blind people are surprised that hungry people, betrayed by admiralsand generals, do not take an interest in voting.“6. If the Kornilovtsi make an attempt, we would show them ourstrength. But why should we risk everything by making an attemptourselves?“Answer: History doesn’t repeat. ‘Perhaps Kornilov will some day makean attempt!’ What a serious base for proletarian action! But supposeKornilov waits for starvation, for the opening of the fronts, whatthen? This attitude means to build the tactics of a revolutionaryparty on one of the bourgeoisie’s former mistakes.“Let us forget everything except that there is no way out but by thedictatorship of the proletariat—either that or the dictatorship ofKornilov.“Let us wait, comrades, for—a miracle!”                                12.                      MILIUKOV’s SPEECH (_Resumé_)“Every one admits, it seems, that the defence of the country is ourprincipal task, and that, to assure it, we must have discipline inthe Army and order in the rear. To achieve this, there must be apower capable of daring, not only by persuasion, but also by force….The germ of all our evils comes from the point of view, original,truly Russian, concerning foreign policy, which passes for theInternationalist point of view.“The noble Lenin only imitates the noble Keroyevsky when he holdsthat from Russia will come the New World which shall resuscitate theaged West, and which will replace the old banner of doctrinarySocialism by the new direct action of starving masses—and that willpush humanity forward and force it to break in the doors of thesocial paradise….”These men sincerely believed that the decomposition of Russia wouldbring about the decomposition of the whole capitalist régime.Starting from that point of view, they were able to commit theunconscious treason, in wartime, of calmly telling the soldiers toabandon the trenches, and instead of fighting the external enemy,creating internal civil war and attacking the proprietors andcapitalists….Here Miliukov was interrupted by furious cries from the Left,demanding what Socialist had ever advised such action….“Martov says that only the revolutionary pressure of the proletariatcan condemn and conquer the evil will of imperialist cliques andbreak down the dictatorship of these cliques…. Not by an accordbetween Governments for a limitation of armaments, but by thedisarming of these Governments and the radical democratisation of themilitary system….”He attacked Martov viciously, and then turned on the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries, whom he accused of entering the Governmentas Ministers with the avowed purpose of carrying on the classstruggle!“The Socialists of Germany and of the Allied countries contemplatedthese gentlemen with ill-concealed contempt, but they decided that itwas for Russia, and sent us some apostles of the UniversalConflagration….“The formula of our democracy is very simple; no foreign policy, noart of diplomacy, an immediate democratic peace, a declaration to theAllies, ‘We want nothing, we haven’t anything to fight with!’ Andthen our adversaries will make the same declaration, and thebrotherhood of peoples will be accomplished!”Miliukov took a fling at the Zimmerwald Manifesto, and declared thateven Kerensky has not been able to escape the influence of “thatunhappy document which will forever be your indictment.” He thenattacked Skobeliev, whose position in foreign assemblies, where hewould appear as a Russian delegate, yet opposed to the foreign policyof his Government, would be so strange that people would say, “What’sthat gentleman carrying, and what shall we talk to him about?” As forthe _nakaz,_ Miliukov said that he himself was a pacifist; that hebelieved in the creation of an International Arbitration Board, andthe necessity for a limitation of armaments, and parliamentarycontrol over secret diplomacy, which did not mean the abolition ofsecret diplomacy.As for the Socialist ideas in the _nakaz,_ which he called “Stockholmideas”—peace without victory, the right of self-determination ofpeoples, and renunciation of the economic war—“The German successes are directly proportionate to the successes ofthose who call themselves the revolutionary democracy. I do not wishto say, ‘to the successes of the Revolution,’ because I believe thatthe defeats of the revolutionary democracy are victories for theRevolution….“The influence of the Soviet leaders abroad is not unimportant. Onehad only to listen to the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairsto be convinced that, in this hall, the influence of therevolutionary democracy on foreign policy is so strong, that theMinister does not dare to speak face to face with it about the honourand dignity of Russia!“We can see, in the _nakaz_ of the Soviets, that the ideas of theStockholm Manifesto have been elaborated in two direction—that ofUtopianism, and that of German interests….Interrupted by the angry cries of the Left, and rebuked by thePresident, Miliukov insisted that the proposition of peace concludedby popular assemblies, not by diplomats, and the proposal toundertake peace negotiations as soon as the enemy had renouncedannexations, were pro-German. Recently Kuhlman said that a personaldeclaration bound only him who made it…. “Anyway, we will imitate theGermans before we will imitate the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’Deputies….”The sections treating of the independence of Lithuania and Livoniawere symptoms of nationalist agitation in different parts of Russia,supported, said Miliukov, by German money…. Amid bedlam from theLeft, he contrasted the clauses of the _nakaz_ concerningAlsace-Lorraine, Rumania, and Serbia, with those treating of thenationalities in Germany and Austria. The _nakaz_ embraced the Germanand Austrian point of view, said Miliukov.Passing to Terestchenko’s speech, he contemptuously accused him ofbeing afraid to speak the thought in his mind, and even afraid tothink in terms of the greatness of Russia. The Dardanelles mustbelong to Russia….“You are continually saying that the soldier does not know why he isfighting, and that when he does know, he’ll fight…. It is true thatthe soldier doesn’t know why he is fighting, but now you have toldhim that there is no reason for him to fight, that we have nonational interests, and that we are fighting for alien ends….”Paying tribute to the Allies, who, he said, with the assistance ofAmerica, “will yet save the cause of humanity,” he ended:“Long live the light of humanity, the advanced democracies of theWest, who for a long time have been travelling the way we now onlybegin to enter, with ill-assured and hesitating steps! Long live ourbrave Allies!”                                13.                        INTERVIEW WITH KERENSKYThe Associated Press man tried his hand. “Mr. Kerensky,” he began,“in England and France people are disappointed with the Revolution——”“Yes, I know,” interrupted Kerensky, quizzically. “Abroad theRevolution is no longer fashionable!”“What is your explanation of why the Russians have stopped fighting?”“That is a foolish question to ask.” Kerensky was annoyed. “Russiaentered the war first of all the Allies, and for a long time she borethe whole brunt of it. Her losses have been inconceivably greaterthan those of all the other nations put together. Russia has now theright to demand of the Allies that they bring greater force of armsto bear.” He stopped for a moment and stared at his interlocutor.“You are asking why the Russians have stopped fighting, and theRussians are asking where is the British fleet—with Germanbattle-ships in the Gulf of Riga?” Again he ceased suddenly, and assuddenly burst out. “The Russian Revolution hasn’t failed and therevolutionary Army hasn’t failed. It is not the Revolution whichcaused disorganisation in the army—that disorganisation wasaccomplished years ago, by the old regime. Why aren’t the Russiansfighting? I will tell you. Because the masses of the people areeconomically exhausted,—and because they are disillusioned with theAllies!”The interview of which this is an excerpt was cabled to the UnitedStates, and in a few days sent back by the American State Department,with a demand that it be “altered.” This Kerensky refused to do; butit was done by his secretary, Dr. David Soskice—and, thus purged ofall offensive references to the Allies, was given to the press of theworld….                      APPENDIX TO CHAPTER III                                 1.                RESOLUTION OF THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES                        _Workers’ Control_1. (See Ppage 43)2. The organisation of Workers’ Control is a manifestation of thesame healthy activity in the sphere of industrial production, as areparty organisations in the sphere of politics, trade unions inemployment, Cooperatives in the domain of consumption, and literaryclubs in the sphere of culture.3. The working-class has much more interest in the proper anduninterrupted operation of factories… than the capitalist class.Workers’ Control is a better security in this respect for theinterests of modern society, of the whole people, than the arbitrarywill of the owners, who are guided only by their selfish desire formaterial profits or political privileges. Therefore Workers’ Controlis demanded by the proletariat not only in their own interest, but inthe interest of the whole country, and should be supported by therevolutionary peasantry as well as the revolutionary Army.4. Considering the hostile attitude of the majority of the capitalistclass toward the Revolution, experience shows that properdistribution of raw materials and fuel, as well as the most efficientmanagement of factories, is impossible without Workers’ Control.5. Only Workers’ Control over capitalist enterprises, cultivating theworkers’ conscious attitude toward work, and making clear its socialmeaning, can create conditions favourable to the development of afirm self-discipline in labour, and the development of all labour’spossible productivity.6. The impending transformation of industry from a war to a peacebasis, and the redistribution of labour all over the country, as wellas among the different factories, can be accomplished without greatdisturbances only by means of the democratic self-government of theworkers themselves…. Therefore the realisation of Workers’ Control isan indispensable preliminary to the demobilisation of industry.7. In accordance with the slogan proclaimed by the Russian SocialDemocratic Labour Party (Bolsheviki), Workers’ Control on a nationalscale, in order to bring results, must extend to all capitalistconcerns, and not be organised accidentally, without system; it mustbe well-planned, and not separated from the industrial life of thecountry as a whole.8. The economic life of the country—agriculture, industry, commerceand transport—must be subjected to one unified plan, constructed soas to satisfy the individual and social requirements of the widemasses of the people; it must be approved by their electedrepresentatives, and carried out under the direction of theserepresentatives by means of national and local organisations.9. That part of the plan which deals with land-labour must be carriedout under supervision of the peasants’ and land-workers’organisations; that relating to industry, trade and transportoperated by wage-earners, by means of Workers’ Control; the naturalorgans of Workers’ Control inside the industrial plant will be theFactory-Shop and similar Committees; and in the labour market, theTrade Unions.10. The collective wage agreements arranged by the Trade Unions forthe majority of workers in any branch of labour, must be binding onall the owners of plants employing this kind of labour in the givendistrict.11. Employment bureaus must be placed under the control andmanagement of the Trade Unions, as class organisations acting withinthe limits of the whole industrial plan, and in accordance with it.12. Trade Unions must have the right, upon their own initiative, tobegin legal action against all employers who violate labour contractsor labour legislation, and also in behalf of any individual worker inany branch of labour.13. On all questions relating to Workers’ Control over production,distribution and employment, the Trade Unions must confer with theworkers of individual establishments through their Factory-ShopCommittees.14. Matters of employment and discharge, vacations, wage scales,refusal of work, degree of productivity and skill, reasons forabrogating agreements, disputes with the administration, and similarproblems of the internal life of the factory, must be settledexclusively according to the findings of the Factory-Shop Committee,which has the right to exclude from participation in the discussionany members of the factory administration.15. The Factory-Shop Committee forms a commission to control thesupplying of the factory with raw materials, fuel, orders, labourpower and technical staff (including equipment), and all othersupplies and arrangements, and also to assure the factory’s adherenceto the general industrial plan. The factory administration is obligedto surrender to the organs of Workers’ Control, for their aid andinformation, all data concerning the business; to make it possible toverify this data, and to produce the books of the company upon demandof the Factory-Shop Committee.16. Any illegal acts on the part of the administration discovered bythe Factory-Shop Committees, or any suspicion of such illegal acts,which cannot be investigated or remedied by the workers alone, shallbe referred to the district central organisation of Factory-ShopCommittees charged with the particular branch of labour involved,which shall discuss the matter with the institutions charged with theexecution of the general industrial plan, and find means to deal withthe matter, even to the extent of confiscating the factory.17. The union of the Factory-Shop Committees of different concernsmust be accomplished on the basis of the different trades, in orderto facilitate control over the whole branch of industry, so as tocome within the general industrial plan; and so as to create aneffective plan of distribution among the different factories oforders, raw materials, fuel, technical and labour power; and also tofacilitate cooperation with the Trade Unions, which are organised bytrades.18. The central city councils of Trade Unions and Factory-ShopCommittees represent the proletariat in the corresponding provincialand  local institutions formed to elaborate and carry out the generalindustrial plan, and to organise economic relations between the townsand the villages (workers and peasants). They also possess finalauthority for the management of Factory-Shop Committees and TradeUnions, so far as Workers’ Control in their district is concerned,and they shall issue obligatory regulations concerning workers’discipline in the routine of production—which regulations, however,must be approved by vote of the workers themselves.                                 2.                THE BOURGEOIS PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI_Russkaya Volia,_ October 28. “The decisive moment approaches…. It isdecisive for the Bolsheviki. Either they will give us… a secondedition of the events of July 16-18, or they will have to admit thatwith their plans and intentions, with their impertinent policy ofwishing to separate themselves from everything consciously national,they have been definitely defeated….“What are the chances of Bolshevik success?“It is difficult to answer that question, for their principal supportis the… ignorance of the popular masses. They speculate on it, theywork upon it by a demagogy which nothing can stop….“The Government must play its part in this affair. Supporting itselfmorally by the Council of the Republic, the Government must take aclearly-defined attitude toward the Bolsheviki….“And if the Bolsheviki provoke an insurrection against the legalpower, and thus facilitate the German invasion, they must be treatedas mutineers and traitors….”_Birzhevya Viedomosti,_ October 28. “Now that the Bolsheviki haveseparated themselves from the rest of the democracy, the struggleagainst them is very much simpler—and it is not reasonable, in orderto fight against Bolshevism, to wait until they make a manifestation.The Government should not even allow the manifestation….“The appeals of the Bolsheviki to insurrection and anarchy are actspunishable by the criminal courts, and in the freest countries, theirauthors would receive severe sentences. For what the Bolsheviki arecarrying on is not a political struggle against the Government, oreven for the power; it is propaganda for anarchy, massacres, andcivil war. This propaganda must be extirpated at its roots; it wouldbe strange to wait, in order to begin action against an agitation for_pogroms,_ until the _pogroms_ actually occurred….”_Novoye Vremya,_ November 1. “hellip; Why is the Government excitedonly about November 2d (date of calling of the Congress of Soviets),and not about September 12th, or October 3d?“This is not the first time that Russia burns and falls in ruins, andthat the smoke of the terrible conflagration makes the eyes of ourAllies smart….“Since it came to power, has there been a single order issued by theGovernment for the purpose of halting anarchy, or has any oneattempted to put out the Russian conflagration?“There were other things to do….“The Government turned its attention to a more immediate problem. Itcrushed an insurrection (the Kornilov attempt) concerning which everyone is now asking, ‘Did it ever exist?”                                 3.                MODERATE SOCIALIST PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI_Dielo Naroda,_ October 28 (Socialist Revolutionary). “The mostfrightful crime of the Bolsheviki against the Revolution is that theyimpute  exclusively to the bad intentions of the revolutionaryGovernment all the calamities which the masses are so cruellysuffering; when as a matter of fact these calamities spring fromobjective causes.“They make golden promises to the masses, knowing in advance thatthey can fulfil none of them; they lead the masses on a false trail,deceiving them as to the source of all their troubles….“The Bolsheviki are the most dangerous enemies of the Revolution….”_Dien,_ October 30 (Menshevik). “Is this really ‘the freedom of thepress’? Every day _Novaya Rus_ and _Rabotchi Put_ openly incite toinsurrection. Every day these two papers commit in their columnsactual crimes. Every day they urge _pogroms_…. Is that ‘the freedomof the press’?…“The Government ought to defend itself and defend us. We have theright to insist that the Government machinery does not remain passivewhile the threat of bloody riots endangers the lives of itscitizens….”                                 4.                            “YEDINSTVO”Plekhanov’s paper, _Yedinstvo,_ suspended publication a few weeksafter the Bolsheviki seized the power. Contrary to popular report,_Yedinstvo_ was not suppressed by the Soviet Government; anannouncement in the last number admitted that it was unable tocontinue _because there were too few subscribers_….                                 5.                WERE THE BOLSHEVIKI CONSPIRATORS?The French newspaper _Entente_ of Petrograd, on November 15th,published an article of which the following is a part:“The Government of Kerensky discusses and hesitates. The Governmentof Lenin and Trotzky attacks and acts.“This last is called a Government of Conspirators, but that is wrong.Government of usurpers, yes, like all revolutionary Governments whichtriumph over their adversaries. Conspirators—no!“No! They did not conspire. On the contrary, openly, audaciously,without mincing words, without dissimulating their intentions, theymultiplied their agitation, intensified their propaganda in thefactories, the barracks, at the Front, in the country, everywhere,even fixing in advance the date of their taking up arms, the date oftheir seizure of the power….“_They_—conspirators? Never….”                                 6.                    APPEAL AGAINST INSURRECTION                _From the Central Army Committee_“… Above everything we insist upon the inflexible execution of theorganised will of the majority of the people, expressed by theProvisional Government in accord with the Council of the Republic andthe _Tsay-ee-kah,_ as organ of the popular power….“Any demonstration to depose this power by violence, at a moment whena Government crisis will infallibly create disorganisation, the ruinof the country, and civil war, will be considered by the Army as acounter-revolutionary act, and repressed by force of arms….“The interests of private groups and classes should be submitted to asingle interest—that of augmenting industrial production, anddistributing the necessities of life with fairness….“All who are capable of sabotage, disorganisation, or disorder, alldeserters, all slackers, all looters, should be forced to doauxiliary service in the rear of the Army….“We invite the Provisional Government to form, out of these violatorsof the people’s will, these enemies of the Revolution, labourdetachments to work in the rear, on the Front, in the trenches underenemy fire….”                                 7.                EVENTS OF THE NIGHT, NOVEMBER 6THToward evening bands of Red Guards began to occupy the printing shopsof the bourgeois press, where they printed _Rabotchi Put, Soldat,_and various proclamations by the hundred thousand. The City Militiawas ordered to clear these places, but found the offices barricaded,and armed men defending them. Soldiers who were ordered to attack theprint-shops refused.About midnight a Colonel with a company of _yunkers_ arrived at theclub “Free Mind,” with a warrant to arrest the editor of _RabotchiPut._ Immediately an enormous mob gathered in the street outside andthreatened to lynch the _yunkers._ The Colonel thereupon begged thathe and the _yunkers_ be arrested and taken to Peter-Paul prison forsafety. This request was granted.At 1 A. M. a detachment of soldiers and sailors from Smolny occupiedthe Telegraph Agency. At 1.35 the Post Office was occupied. Towardmorning the Military Hotel was taken, and at 5 o’clock the TelephoneExchange. At dawn the State Bank was surrounded. And at 10 A. M. acordon of troops was drawn about the Winter Palace.                       APPENDIX TO CHAPTER IV                                 1.                        EVENTS OF NOVEMBER 7THFrom 4 A. M. until dawn Kerensky remained at the Petrograd StaffHeadquarters, sending orders to the Cossacks and to the _yunkers_ inthe Officers’ Schools in and around Petrograd—all of whom answeredthat they were unable to move.Colonel Polkovnikov, Commandant of the City, hurried between theStaff and the Winter Palace, evidently without any plan. Kerenskygave an order to open the bridges; three hours passed without anyaction, and then an officer and five men went out on their owninitiative, and putting to flight a picket of Red Guards, opened theNicolai Bridge. Immediately after they left, however, some sailorsclosed it again.Kerensky ordered the print-shop of _Rabotchi Put_ to be occupied. Theofficer detailed to the work was promised a squad of soldiers; twohours later he was promised some _yunkers;_ then the order wasforgotten.An attempt was made to recapture the Post Office and the TelegraphAgency; a few shots were fired, and the Government troops announcedthat they would no longer oppose the Soviets.To a delegation of _yunkers_ Kerensky said, “As chief of theProvisional Government and as Supreme Commander I know nothing, Icannot advise you; but as a veteran revolutionist, I appeal to you,young revolutionists, to remain at your posts and defend theconquests of the Revolution.”Orders of Kishkin, November 7th:“By decree of the Provisional Government…. I am invested withextraordinary powers for the reestablishment of order in Petrograd,in complete command of all civil and military authorities….”“In accordance with the powers conferred upon me by the ProvisionalGovernment, I herewith relieve from his functions as Commandant ofthe Petrograd Military District Colonel George Polkovnikov….”                        *     *     *     *     *_Appeal to the Population_ signed by Vice-Premier Konovalov, November7th:“Citizens!

A telegram has been sent to the_Stavka;_ and an answer received says that a strong detachment oftroops is being sent….“Let the Army and the People reject the irresponsible attempts of theBolsheviki to create a revolt in the rear….”About 9 A. M. Kerensky left for the Front….Toward evening two soldiers on bicycles presented themselves at theStaff Headquarters, as delegates of the garrison of Peter-PaulFortress. Entering the meeting-room of the Staff, where Kishkin,Rutenburg, Paltchinski, General Bagratouni, Colonel Paradielov andCount Tolstoy were gathered, they demanded the immediate surrender ofthe Staff; threatening, in case of refusal, to bombard headquarters….After two panicky conferences the Staff retreated to the WinterPalace, and the headquarters were occupied by Red Guards….Late in the afternoon several Bolshevik armoured cars cruised aroundthe Palace Square, and Soviet soldiers tried unsuccessfully to parleywith the _yunkers_….Firing on the Palace began about 7 o’clock in the evening….At 10 P. M. began an artillery bombardment from three sides, in whichmost of the shells were blanks, only three small shrapnels strikingthe facade of the Palace….                                 2.                        KERENSKY IN FLIG{HT  -ed.}Leaving Petrograd in the morning of November 7th, Kerensky arrived byautomobile at Gatchina, where he demanded a special train. Towardevening he was in Ostrov, Province of Pskov. The next morning,extraordinary  session of the local Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’Depulies, with participation of Cossack delegates—there being 6,000Cossacks at Ostrov.Kerensky spoke to the assembly, appealing for aid against theBolsheviki, and addressed himself almost exclusively to the Cossacks.The soldier delegates protested.“Why did you come here?” shouted voices. Kerensky answered, “To askthe Cossacks’ assistance in crushing the Bolshevik insurrection!” Atthis there were violent protestations, which increased when hecontinued, “I broke the Kornilov attempt, and I will break theBolsheviki!” The noise became so great that he had to leave theplatform….The soldier deputies and the Ussuri Cossacks decided to arrestKerensky, but the Don Cossacks prevented them, and got him away bytrain…. A Military Revolutionary Committee, set up during the day,tried to inform the garrison of Pskov; but the telephone andtelegraph lines were cut….Kerensky did not arrive at Pskov. Revolutionary soldiers had cut therailway line, to prevent troops being sent against the capital. Onthe night of November 8th he arrived by automobile at Luga, where hewas well received by the Death Battalions stationed there.Next day he took train for the South-West Front, and visited the ArmyCommittee at headquarters. The Fifth Army, however, was wild withenthusiasm over the news of the Bolshevik success, and the ArmyCommittee was unable to promise Kerensky any support.From there he went to the _Stavka,_ at Moghilev, where he ordered tenregiments from different parts of the Front to move againstPetrograd. The soldiers almost unanimously refused; and thoseregiments which did start halted on the way. About five thousandCossacks finally followed him….                                 3.                    LOOTING OF THE WINTER PALACEI do not mean to maintain that there was no looting, in the WinterPalace. Both after and _before_ the Winter Palace fell, there wasconsiderable pilfering. The statement of the Socialist Revolutionarypaper _Narod,_ and of members of the City Duma, to the effect thatprecious objects to the value of 500,000,000 rubles had been stolen,was, however, a gross exaggeration.The most important art treasures of the Palace—paintings, statues,tapestries, rare porcelains and armorie,—had been transferred toMoscow during the month of September; and they were still in goodorder in the basement of the Imperial Palace there ten days after thecapture of the Kremlin by Bolshevik troops. I can personally testifyto this….Individuals, however, especially the general public, which wasallowed to circulate freely through the Winter Palace for severaldays after its capture, made away with table silver, clocks, bedding,mirrors and some odd vases of valuable porcelain and semi-preciousstone, to the value of about $50,000.The Soviet Government immediately created a special commission,composed of artists and archæologists, to recover the stolen objects.On November 1st two proclamations were issued:                        “CITIZENS OF PETROGRAD!“We urgently ask all citizens to exert every effort to find whateverpossible of the objects stolen from the Winter Palace in the night ofNovember 7-8, and to forward them to the Commandant of the WinterPalace.“Receivers of stolen goods, antiquarians, and all who are proved tobe hiding such objects will be held legally responsible and punishedwith all severity.“_Commissars for the Protection of Museums and Artistic Collections,_                                “G.

MANDELBAUM.”About half the loot was recovered, some of it in the baggage offoreigners leaving Russia.A conference of artists and archæologists, held at the suggestion ofSmolny, appointed a commission of make an inventory of the WinterPalace treasures, which was given complete charge of the Palace andof all artistic collections and State museums in Petrograd. OnNovember 16th the Winter Palace was closed to the public while theinventory was being made….During the last week in November a decree was issued by the Councilof People’s Commissars, changing the name of the Winter Palace to“People’s Museum,” entrusting it to the complete charge of theartistic-archæological commission, and declaring that henceforth allGovernmental activities within its wall were prohibited….                                 4.                    RAPE OF THE WOMEN’S BATTALIONImmediately following the taking of the Winter Palace all sorts ofsensational stories were published in the anti-Bolshevik press, andtold in the City Duma, about the fate of the Women’s Battaliondefending the Palace. It was said that some of the girl-soldiers hadbeen thrown from the windows into the street, most of the rest hadbeen violated, and many had committed suicide as a result of thehorrors they had gone through.The City Duma appointed a commission to investigate the matter. OnNovember 16th the commission returned from Levashovo, headquarters ofthe Women’s Battalion. Madame Tyrkova reported that the girls hadbeen at first taken to the barracks of the Pavlovsky Regiment, andthat there some of them had been badly treated; but that at presentmost of them were at Levashovo, and the rest scattered about the cityin private houses. Dr. Mandelbaum, another of the commission,testified drily that _none_ of the women had been thrown out of thewindows of the Winter Palace, that _none_ were wounded, that threehad been violated, and that one had committed suicide, leaving a notewhich said that she had been “disappointed in her ideals.”On November 21st the Military Revolutionary Committee officiallydissolved the Women’s Battalion, at the request of the girlsthemselves, who returned to civilian clothes.In Louise Bryant’s book, “Six Red Months in Russia,” there is aninteresting description of the girl-soldiers during this time.                        APPENDIX TO CHAPTER V                                 1.                        APPEALS AND PROCLAMATIONS_From the Military Revolutionary Committee,_ November 8:“To All Army Committees and All Soviets of Soldiers’ Deputies.“The Petrograd garrison has overturned the Government of Kerensky,which had risen against the Revolution and the People…. In sendingthis news to the Front and the country, the Military RevolutionaryCommittee requests all soldiers to keep vigilant watch on the conductof officers. Officers who do not frankly and openly declare for theRevolution should be immediately arrested as enemies.“The Petrograd Soviet interprets the programme of the new Governmentas: immediate proposals of a general democratic peace, the immediatetransfer of great landed estates to the peasants, and the honestconvocation of the Constituent Assembly. The people’s revolutionaryArmy must not permit troops of doubtful morale to be sent toPetrograd. Act by means of arguments, by means of moral suasion—butif that fails, halt the movement of troops by implacable force.“The present order must be immediately read to all military units ofevery branch of the service. Whoever keeps the knowledge of thisorder from the soldier-masses…. commits a serious crime against theRevolution, and will be punished with all the rigour of revolutionarylaw.“Soldiers!

The presidents of the variouslocal Soviets are invited to enter into direct relations with therevolutionary Government.”                                _Military Revolutionary Committee._                                 2.                PROTEST OF THE MUNICIPAL DUMA“The Central City Duma, elected on the most democratic principles,has undertaken the burden of managing Municipal affairs and foodsupplies at the time of the greatest disorganisation. At the presentmoment the Bolshevik party, three weeks before the elections to theConstituent Assembly, and in spite of the menace of the externalenemy, having removed by armed force the only legal revolutionaryauthority, is making an attempt against the rights and independenceof the Municipal Self-Government, demanding submission to itsCommissars and its illegal authority.“In this terrible and tragic moment the Petrograd City Duma, in theface of its constituents, and of all Russia, declares loudly that itwill not submit to any encroachments on its rights and itsindependence, and will remain at the post of responsibility to whichit has been called by the will of the population of the capital.“The Central City Duma of Petrograd appeals to all Dumas and Zemstvosof the Russian Republic to rally to the defence of one of thegreatest conquests of the Russian Revolution—the independence andinviolability of popular self-government.”                                 3.                LAND DECREE—PEASANTS’ “NAKAZ”The Land question can only be permanently settled by the generalConstituent Assembly.The most equitable solution of the Land question should be as follows:1. The right of private ownership of land is abolished forever; landcannot be sold, nor leased, nor mortgaged, nor alienated in any way.All dominical lands, lands attached to titles, lands belonging to theEmperor’s cabinet, to monasteries, churches, possession lands,entailed lands, private estates, communal lands, peasant free-holds,and others, are confiscated without compensation, and become nationalproperty, and are placed at the disposition of the workers whocultivate them.Those who are damaged because of this social transformation of therights of property are entitled to public aid during the timenecessary for them to adapt themselves to the new conditions ofexistence.2. All the riches beneath the earth—ores, oil, coal, salt, etc.—aswell as forests and waters having a national importance, become theexclusive property of the State. All minor streams, lakes and forestsare placed in the hands of the communities, on condition of beingmanaged by the local organs of government.3. All plots of land scientifically cultivated—gardens, plantations,nurseries, seed-plots, green-houses, and others—shall not be divided,but transformed into model farms, and pass into the hands of theState or of the community, according to their size and importance.Buildings, communal lands and villages with their private gardens andtheir orchards remain in the hands of their present owners; thedimensions of these plots and the rate of taxes for their use shallbe fixed by law.4. All studs, governmental and private cattle-breeding andbird-breeding establishments, and others, are confiscated and becomenational property, and are transferred either to the State or to thecommunity, according to their size and importance.All questions of compensation for the above are within the competenceof the Constituent Assembly.5. All inventoried agricultural property of the confiscated lands,machinery  and live-stock, are transferred without compensation tothe State or the community, according to their quantity andimportance.The confiscation of such machinery or live-stock shall not apply tothe small properties of peasants.6. The right to use the land is granted to all citizens, withoutdistinction of sex, who wish to work the land themselves, with thehelp of their families, or in partnership, and only so long as theyare able to work. No hired labour is permitted.In the event of the incapacity for work of a member of the communefor a period of two years, the commune shall be bound to render himassistance during this time by working his land in common.Farmers who through old age or sickness have permanently lost thecapacity to work the land themselves, shall surrender their land andreceive instead a Government pension.7. The use of the land should be equalised—that is to say, the landshall be divided among the workers according to local conditions, theunit of labour and the needs of the individual.The way in which land is to be used may be individually determinedupon: as homesteads, as farms, by communes, by partnerships, as willbe decided by the villages and settlements.8. All land upon its confiscation is pooled in the general People’sLand Fund. Its distribution among the workers is carried out by thelocal and central organs of administration, beginning with thevillage democratic organisations and ending with the centralprovincial institutions—with the exception of urban and ruralcooperative societies.The Land Fund is subject to periodical redistribution according tothe increase of population and the development of productivity andrural economy.In case of modification of the boundaries of allotments, the originalcentre of the allotment remains intact.The lands of persons retiring from the community return to the LandFund; providing that near relatives of the persons retiring, orfriends designated by them, shall have preference in theredistribution of these lands.When lands are returned to the Land Fund, the money expended formanuring or improving the land, which has not been exhausted, shallbe reimbursed.If in some localities the Land Fund is insufficient to satisfy thelocal population, the surplus population should emigrate.The organisation of the emigration, also the costs thereof, and theproviding of emigrants with the necessary machinery and live-stock,shall be the business of the State.The emigration shall be carried out in the following order: first,the peasants without land who express their wish to emigrate; thenthe undesirable members of the community, deserters, etc., andfinally, by drawing lots on agreement.All which is contained in this _nakaz,_ being the expression of theindisputable will of the great majority of conscious peasants ofRussia, is declared to be a temporary law, and until the convocationof the Constituent Assembly, becomes effective immediately so far asis possible, and in some parts of it gradually, as will be determinedby the District Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies.                                 4.                        THE LAND AND DESERTERSThe Government was not forced to make any decision concerning therights of deserters to the land. The end of the war and thedemobilisation of the army automatically removed the deserterproblem….                                 5.                THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARSThe Council of People’s Commissars was at first composed entirely ofBolsheviki. This was not entirely the fault of the Bolsheviki,however. On November 8th they offered portfolios to members of theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries, who declined. See page 273. {of originalvolume}                       APPENDIX  TO CHAPTER VI                                 1.                        APPEALS AND DENUNCIATIONSAppeal to all Citizens and to the Military Organisations of theSocialist Revolutionary Party.“The senseless attempt of the Bolsheviki is on the eve of completefailure. The garrison is disaffected…. The Ministries are idle, breadis lacking. All factions except a handful of Bolsheviki have left theCongress of Soviets. The Bolsheviki are alone! Abuses of all sorts,acts of vandalism and pillage, the bombardment of the Winter Palace,arbitrary arrests—all these crimes committed by the Bolsheviki havearoused against them the resentment of the majority of the sailorsand soldiers. The _Tsentroflot_ refuses to submit to the orders ofthe Bolsheviki….“We call upon all sane elements to gather around the Committee forSalvation of Country and Revolution; to take serious measures to beready, at the first call of the Central Committee of the Party, toact against the counter-revolutionists, who will doubtless attempt toprofit by these troubles provoked by the Bolshevik adventure, and towatch closely the external enemy, who also would like to takeadvantage of this opportune moment when the Front is weakened….”                _The Military Section of the Central Committee of                        the Socialist Revolutionary Party._                        *     *     *     *     *From _Pravda:_“What is Kerensky?“A usurper, whose place is in Peter-Paul prison, with Kornilov andKishkin.“A criminal and a traitor to the workers, soldiers and peasants, whobelieved in him.“Kerensky? A murderer of soldiers!“Kerensky? A public executioner of peasants!“Kerensky? A strangler of workers!“Such is the second Kornilov who now wants to butcher Liberty!”                      APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VII                                 1.                            TWO DECREES                            _On the Press_In the serious decisive hour of the Revolution and the daysimmediately following it, the Provisional Revolutionary Committee iscompelled to adopt a series of measures against thecounter-revolutionary press of all shades.Immediately on all sides there are cries that the new Socialistauthority is in this violating the essential principles of its ownprogramme by an attempt against the freedom of the press.The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government calls the attention of thepopulation to the fact that in our country, behind this liberalshield, is hidden the opportunity for the wealthier classes to seizethe lion’s share of the whole press, and by this means to poison thepopular mind and bring confusion into the consciousness of the masses.Every one knows that the bourgeois press is one of the most powerfulweapons of the bourgeoisie. Especially in this critical moment, whenthe new authority of the workers and peasants is in process ofconsolidation, it is impossible to leave it in the hands of theenemy, at a time when it is not less dangerous than bombs andmachine-guns. This is why temporary and extraordinary measures havebeen adopted for the purpose of stopping the flow of filth andcalumny in which the yellow and green press would be glad to drownthe young victory of the people.As soon as the new order is consolidated, all administrative measuresagainst the press will be suspended; full liberty will be given itwithin the limits of responsibility before the law, in accordancewith the broadest and most progressive regulations….Bearing in mind, however, the fact that any restrictions of thefreedom of the press, even in critical moments, are admissible onlywithin the bounds of necessity, the Council of People’s Commissarsdecrees as follows:1. The following classes of newspapers shall be subject to closure:(a) Those inciting to open resistance or disobedience to the Workers’and Peasants’ Government; (b) Those creating confusion by obviouslyand deliberately perverting the news; (c) Those inciting to acts of acriminal character punishable by the laws.2. The temporary or permanent closing of any organ of the press shallbe carried out only by virtue of a resolution of the Council ofPeople’s Commissars.3. The present decree is of a temporary nature, and will be revokedby a special _ukaz_ when normal conditions of public life arere-established.                       _President of the Council of People’s Commissars,_                                                VLADIMIR ULIANOV (LENIN).                        *     *     *     *     *                        _On Workers’ Militia_1. All Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies shall form aWorkers’ Militia.2. This Workers’ Militia shall be entirely at the orders of theSoviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.3. Military and civil authorities must render every assistance inarming the workers and in supplying them with technical equipment,even to the extent of requisitioning arms belonging to the WarDepartment of the Government.4. This decree shall be promulgated by telegraph. Petrograd, November10, 1917.                                _People’s Commissar of the Interior_                                                A. I.

THE STRIKE FUNDThe fund for the striking Government employees and bank clerks wassubscribed by banks and business houses of Petrograd and othercities, and also by foreign corporations doing business in Russia.All who consented to strike against the Bolsheviki were paid fullwages, and in some cases their pay was increased. It was therealisation of the strike fund contributors that the Bolsheviki werefirmly in power, followed by their refusal to pay strike benefits,which finally broke the strike.                      APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VIII                                 1.                        KERENSKY’S ADVANCEOn November 9th Kerensky and his Cossacks arrived at Gatchina, wherethe garrison, hopelessly split into two factions, immediatelysurrendered. The members of the Gatchina Soviet were arrested, and atfirst threatened with death; later they were released on goodbehaviour.The Cossack advance-guards, practically unopposed, occupied Pavlovsk,Alexandrovsk and other stations, and reached the outskirts ofTsarskoye Selo next morning—November 10th. At once the garrisondivided into three groups—the officers, loyal to Kerenskly; part ofthe soldiers and non-commissioned officers, who declared themselves“neutral”; and most of the rank and file, who were for theBolsheviki. The Bolshevik soldiers, who were without leaders ororganisation, fell back toward the capital. The local Soviet alsowithdrew to the village of Pulkovo.From Pulkovo six members of the Tsarskoye Selo Soviet went with anautomobile-load of proclamations to Gatchina, to propagandise theCossacks. They spent most of the day going around Gatchina from oneCossack barracks to another, pleading, arguing and explaining. Towardevening some officers discovered their presence and they werearrested and brought before General Krasnov, who said, “You foughtagainst Kornilov; now you are opposing Kerensky. I’ll have you allshot!”After reading aloud to them the order appointing himcommander-in-chief of the Petrograd District, Krasnov asked if theywere Bolsheviki. They replied in the affirmative—upon which Krasnovwent away; a short time later an officer came and set them free,saying that it was by order of General Krasnov….In the meanwhile delegations continued to arrive from Petrograd; fromthe Duma, the Committee for Salvation, and, last of all, from the_Vikzhel._ The Union of Railway Workers insisted that some agreementbe reached to halt the civil war, and demanded that Kerensky treatwith the Bolsheviki, and that he stop the advance on Petrograd. Incase of refusal, the _Vikzhel_ threatened a general strike atmidnight of November 11th.Kerensky asked to be allowed to discuss the matter with the SocialistMinisters and with the Committee for Salvation. He was plainlyundecided.On the 11th Cossack outposts reached Krasnoye Selo, from which thelocal Soviet and the heterogeneous forces of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee precipitately retired, some of themsurrendering…. That night they also touched Pulkovo, where the firstreal resistance was encountered….Cossacks deserters began to dribble into Petrograd, declaring thatKerensky had lied to them, that he had spread broadcast over thefront proclamations which said that Petrograd was burning, that theBolsheviki  had invited the Germans to come in, and that they weremurdering women and children and looting indiscriminately….The Military Revolutionary Committee immediately sent out some dozensof “agitators,” with thousands of printed appeals, to inform theCossacks of the real situation….                                 2.        PROCLAMATIONS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE“To All Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies.“The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ andPeasants’ Deputies charges the local Soviets immediately to take themost energetic measures to oppose all counter-revolutionaryanti-Semitic disturbances, and all _pogroms_ of whatever nature. Thehonour of the workers’, peasants’ and soldiers’ Revolution cannottolerate any disorders….“The Red Guard of Petrograd, the revolutionary garrison and thesailors have maintained complete order in the capital.“Workers, soldiers, and peasants, everywhere you should follow theexample of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd.“Comrades soldiers and Cossacks, on us falls the duty of keeping realrevolutionary order.“All revolutionary Russia and the whole world have their eyes onyou….”“The All-Russian Congress of Soviets decrees:“To abolish capital punishment at the Front, which was reintroducedby Kerensky.“Complete freedom of propaganda is to be re-established in thecountry. All soldiers and revolutionary officers now under arrest forso-called political ‘crimes’ are at once to be set free.”“The ex-Premier Kerensky, overthrown by the people, refuses to submitto the Congress of Soviets and attempts to struggle against the legalGovernment elected by the All-Russian Congress—the Council ofPeople’s Commissars. The Front has refused to aid Kerensky. Moscowhas rallied to the new Government. In many cities (Minsk, Moghilev,Kharkov) the power is in the hands of the Soviets. No infantrydetachment consents to march against the Workers’ and Peasants’Government, which, in accord with the firm will of the Army and thepeople, has begun peace negotiations and has given the land to thepeasants….“We give public warning that if the Cossacks do not halt Kerensky,who has deceived them and is leading them against Petrograd, therevolutionary forces will rise with all their might for the defenceof the precious conquests of the Revolution—Peace and Land.“Citizens of Petrograd! Kerensky fled from the city, abandoning theauthority to Kishkin, who wanted to surrender the capital to theGermans; Rutenburg, of the Black Band, who sabotaged the MunicipalFood Supply; and Paltchinsky, hated by the whole democracy. Kerenskyhas fled, abandoning you to the Germans, to famine, to bloodymassacres. The revolting people have arrested Kerensky’s Ministers,and you have seen how the order and supplying of Petrograd at onceimproved. Kerensky, at the demand of the aristocrat proprietors, thecapitalists, speculators, marches against you for the purpose ofgiving back the land to the land-owners, and continuing the hated andruinous war.“Citizens of Petrograd! We know that the great majority of you are infavour of the people’s revolutionary authority, against theKornilovtsi led by Kerensky. Do not be deceived by the lyingdeclarations of the impotent bourgeois conspirators, who will bepitilessly crushed.“Workers, soldiers, peasants! We call upon you for revolutionarydevotion and discipline.“Millions of peasants and soldiers are with us.“The victory of the people’s Revolution is assured!”                                 3.                ACTS OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARSIn this book I am giving only such decrees as are in my opinionpertinent to the Bolshevik conquest of power. The rest belong to adetailed account of the Structure of the Soviet State, for which Ihave no place in this work. This will be dealt with very fully in thesecond volume, now in preparation, “Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk.”                _Concerning Dwelling-Places_1. The independent Municipal Self-Governments have the right tosequestrate all unoccupied or uninhabited dwelling-places.2. The Municipalities may, according to laws and arrangementsestablished by them, install in all available lodgings citizens whohave no place to live, or who live in congested or unhealthy lodgings.3. The Municipalities may establish a service of inspection ofdwelling-places, organise it and define its powers.4. The Municipalities may issue orders on the institution of HouseCommittees, define their organisation, their powers and give themjuridical authority.5. The Municipalities may create Housing Tribunals, define theirpowers and their authority.6. This decree is promulgated by telegraph.                                _People’s Commissar of the Interior,_                                                A. I.

The Government of the Tsar, the proprietors and thecapitalists, as well as the Government of coalition and conciliation,failed to realise the desires of the workers with regard to SocialInsurance.The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government, relying upon the support ofthe Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, announcesto the working-class of Russia and to the town and village poor, thatit will immediately prepare laws on Social Insurance based on theformulas proposed by the Labour organisations:1. Insurance for all wage-workers without exception, as well as forall urban and rural poor.2. Insurance to cover all categories of loss of working capacity,such as illness, infirmities, old age, childbirth, widowhood,orphanage, and unemployment.3. All the costs of insurance to be charged to employers.4. Compensation of at least full wages in all loss of workingcapacity and unemployment.5. Complete workers’ self-government of all Insurance institutions.In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic,                                _The People’s Commissar of Labour,_                                                ALEXANDER SHLIAPNIKOV.                        *     *     *     *     *                        _On Popular Education_Citizens of Russia!With the insurrection of November 7th the working masses have won forthe first time the real power.The All-Russian Congress of Soviets has temporarily transferred thispower both to its Executive Committee and to the Council of People’sCommissars.By the will of the revolutionary people, I have been appointedPeople’s Commissar of Education.The work of guiding in general the people’s education, inasmuch as itremains with the central government, is, until the ConstituentAssembly meets, entrusted to a Commission on the People’s Education,whose chairman and executive is the People’s Commissar.Upon what fundamental propositions will rest this State Commission?How is its sphere of competence determined?_The General Line of Educational Activity:_ Every genuinelydemocratic power must, in the domain of education, in a country whereilliteracy and ignorance reign supreme, make its first aim thestruggle against this darkness. It must acquire in the shortest time_universal literacy,_ by organising a network of schools answering tothe demands of modern pedagogics; it must introduce universal,obligatory and free tuition for all, and establish at the same time aseries of such teachers’ institutes and seminaries as will in theshortest time furnish a powerful army of people’s teachers sonecessary for the universal instruction of the population of ourboundless Russia._Decentralisation:_ The State Commission on People’s Education is byno means a central power governing the institutions of instructionand education. On the contrary, the entire school work ought to betransferred to the organs of local self-government. The independentwork of the workers, soldiers and peasants, establishing on their owninitiative cultural educational organisations, must be given fullautonomy, both by the State centre and the Municipal centres.The work of the State Commission serves as a link and helpmate toorganise resources of material and moral support to the Municipal andprivate institutions, particularly to those with a class-characterestablished by the workers._The State Committee on People’s Education:_ A whole series ofinvaluable law projects was elaborated from the beginning of theRevolution by the State Committee for People’s Education, a tolerablydemocratic body as to its composition, and rich in experts. The StateCommission sincerely desires the collaboration of this Committee.It has addressed itself to the bureau of the Committee, with therequest at once to convoke an extraordinary session of the Committeefor the fulfilment of the following programme:1. The revision of rules of representation in the Committee, in thesense of greater democratisation.2. The revision of the Committee’s rights in the sense of wideningthem, and of converting the Committee into a fundamental Stateinstitute for the elaboration of law projects calculated toreorganise public instruction and education in Russia upon democraticprinciples.3. The revision, jointly with the new State Commission, of the lawsalready created by the Committee, a revision required by the factthat in editing them the Committee had to take into account thebourgeois spirit of previous Ministries, which obstructed it even inthis its narrowed form.After this revision these laws will be put into effect without anybureau-cratic red tape, in the revolutionary order._The Pedagogues and the Societists:_ The State Commission welcomesthe pedagogues to the bright and honourable work of educating thepeople—the masters of the country.No one measure in the domain of the people’s education ought to beadopted by any power without the attentive deliberation of those whorepresent the pedagogues.On the other hand, a decision cannot by any means be reachedexclusively through the cooperation of specialists. This refers aswell to reforms of the institutes of general education.The cooperation of the pedagogues with the social forces—this is howthe Commission will work both in its own constitution, in the StateCommittee, and in all its activities.As its first task the Commission considers the improvement of theteachers’ status, and first of all of those very poor though almostmost important contributors to the work of culture—the elementaryschool teachers. Their just demands ought to be satisfied at once andat any cost. The proletariat of the schools has in vain demanded anincrease of salary to one hundred rubles per month. It would be adisgrace any longer to keep in poverty the teachers of theoverwhelming majority of the Russian people.But a real democracy cannot stop at mere literacy, at universalelementary instruction. It must endeavour to organise a uniformsecular school of several grades. The ideal is, equal and if possiblehigher education for all the citizens. So long as this idea has notbeen realised for all, the natural transition through all theschooling grades up to the university—a transition to a higherstage—must depend entirely upon the pupil’s aptitude, and not uponthe resources of his family.The problem of a genuinely democratic organisation of instruction isparticularly difficult in a country impoverished by a long, criminal,imperialistic war; but the workers who have taken the power mustremember that education will serve them as the greatest instrument intheir struggle for a better lot and for a spiritual growth. Howeverneedful it may be to curtail other articles of the people’s budget,the expenses on education must stand high. A large educational budgetis the pride and glory of a nation. The free and enfranchised peoplesof Russia will not forget this.The fight against illiteracy and ignorance cannot be confined to athorough establishment of school education for children and youths.Adults, too, will be anxious to save themselves from the debasingposition of a man who cannot read and write. The school for adultsmust occupy a conspicuous place in the general plan of popularinstruction._Instruction and Education:_ One must emphasise the differencebetween instruction and education.Instruction is the transmission of ready knowledge by the teacher tohis pupil. Education is a creative process. The personality of theindividual is being “educated” throughout life, is being formed,grows richer in content, stronger and more perfect.The toiling masses of the people—the workmen, the peasants, thesoldiers—are thirsting for elementary and advanced instruction. Butthey are also thirsting for education. Neither the government nor theintellectuals nor any other power outside of themselves can give itto them. The school, the book, the theatre, the museum, etc., mayhere by only aids. They have their own ideas, formed by their socialposition, so different from the position of those ruling classes andintellectuals who have hitherto created culture. They have their ownideas, their own emotions, their own ways of approaching the problemsof personality and society. The city labourer, according to his ownfashion, the rural toiler according to his, will each build his clearworld-conception permeated with the class-idea  of the workers. Thereis no more superb or beautiful phenomenon than the one of which ournearest descendants will be both witnesses and participants: Thebuilding by collective Labour of its own general, rich and free soul.Instruction will surely be an important but not a decisive element.What is more important here is the criticism, the creativeness of themasses themselves; for science and art have only in some of theirparts a general human importance. They suffer radical changes withevery far-reaching class upheaval.Throughout Russia, particularly among the city labourers, but alsoamong the peasants, a powerful wave of cultural educational movementhas arisen; workers’ and soldiers’ organisations of this kind aremultiplying rapidly. To meet them, to lend them support, to clear theroad before them is the first task of a revolutionary and populargovernment in the domain of democratic education._The Constituent Assembly_ will doubtless soon begin its work. Italone can permanently establish the order of national and social lifein our country, and at the same time the general character of theorganisation of popular education.Now, however, with the passage of power to the Soviets, the reallydemocratic character of the Constituent Assembly is assured. The linewhich the State Commission, relying upon the State Committee, willfollow, will hardly suffer any modification under the influence ofthe Constituent Assembly. Without pre-determining it, the newPeople’s Government considers itself within its rights in enacting inthis domain a series of measures which aim at enriching andenlightening as soon as possible the spiritual life of the country._The Ministry:_ The present work must in the interim proceed throughthe Ministry of the People’s Education. Of all the necessaryalterations in its composition and construction the State Commissionwill have charge, elected by the Executive Committee of the Sovietsand the State Committee. Of course the order of State authority inthe domain of the people’s education will be established by theConstituent Assembly. Until then, the Ministry must play the part ofthe executive apparatus for both the State Committee and the StateCommission for People’s Education.The pledge of the country’s safety lies in the cooperation of all itsvital and genuinely democratic forces.We believe that the energetic effort of the working people and of thehonest enlightened intellectuals will lead the country out of itspainful crisis, and through complete democracy to the reign ofSocialism and the brotherhood of nations.                                _People’s Commissar on Education,_                                        A.

MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE. BULLETIN NO. 2November 12th, in the evening, Kerensky sent a proposition to therevolutionary troops—“to lay down their arms.” Kerensky’s men openedartillery fire. Our artillery answered and compelled the enemy to besilent. The Cossacks assumed the offensive. The deadly fire of thesailors, the Red Guards and the soldiers forced the Cossacks toretreat. Our armoured cars rushed in among the ranks of the enemy.The enemy is fleeing. Our troops are in pursuit. The order has beengiven to arrest Kerensky. Tsarskoye Selo has been taken by therevolutionary troops._The Lettish Riflemen:_ The Military Revolutionary Committee hasreceived precise information that the valiant Lettish Riflemen havearrived from the Front and taken up a position in the rear ofKerensky’s bands._From the Staff of the Military Revolutionary Committee_The seizure of Gatchina and Tsarskoye Selo by Kerensky’s detachmentsis to be explained by the complete absence of artillery andmachine-guns in these places, whereas Kerensky’s cavalry was providedwith artillery from the beginning. The last two days were days ofenforced work for our Staff, to provide the necessary quantity ofguns, machine-guns, field telephones, etc., for the revolutionarytroops. When this work—with the energetic assistance of the DistrictSoviets and the factories (the Putilov Works, Obukhov and others)—wasaccomplished, the issue of the expected encounter left no place fordoubt: on the side of the revolutionary troops there was not only asurplus in quantity and such a powerful material base as Petrograd,but also an enormous moral advantage. All the Petrograd regimentsmoved out to the positions with tremendous enthusiasm. The GarrisonConference elected a Control Commission of five soldiers, thussecuring a complete unity between the commander in chief and thegarrison. At the Garrison Conference it was unanimously decided tobegin decisive action.The artillery fire on the 12th of November developed withextraordinary force by 3 P.M. The Cossacks were completelydemoralised. A parliamentarian came from them to the staff of thedetachment at Krasnoye Selo, and proposed to stop the firing,threatening otherwise to take “decisive” measures. He was answeredthat the firing would cease when Kerensky laid down his arms.In the developing encounter all sections of the troops—the sailors,soldiers and the Red Guards—showed unlimited courage. The sailorscontinued to advance until they had fired all their cartridges. Thenumber of casualties has not been established yet, but it is largeron the part of the counter-revolutionary troops, who experiencedgreat losses through one of our armoured cars.Kerensky’s staff, fearing that they would be surrounded, gave theorder to retreat, which retreat speedily assumed a disorderlycharacter. By 11-12 P.M., Tsarkoye Selo, including the wirelessstation, was entirely occupied by the troops of the Soviets. TheCossacks retreated towards Gatchina and Colpinno.The morale of the troops is beyond all praise. The order has beengiven to pursue the retreating Cossacks. From the Tsarskoye Selostation a radio-telegram was sent immediately to the Front and to alllocal Soviets throughout Russia. Further details will becommunicated….                                 2.                    EVENTS OF THE 13TH IN PETROGRADThree regiments of the Petrograd garrison to take any part in thebattle against Kerensky. On the morning of the 13th they summoned toa joint conference sixty delegates from the Front, in order to findsome way to stop the civil war. This conference appointed a committeeto go and persuade Kerensky’s troops to lay down their arms. Theyproposed to ask the Government soldiers the following questions: (1)Will the soldiers and Cossacks of Kerensky recognise the_Tsay-ee-kah_ as the repository of Governmental power, responsible tothe Congress of Soviets? (2) Will the soldiers and Cossacks acceptthe decrees of the second Congress of Soviets? (3) Will they acceptthe Land and Peace decrees? (4) Will they agree to cease hostilitiesand return to their units? (5) Will they consent to the arrest ofKerensky, Krasnov and Savinkov?At the meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, Zinoviev said, “It would befoolish to think that this committee could finish affair. The enemycan only be broken by force. However, it would be a crime for us notto try every peaceful means to bring the Cossacks over to us…. Whatwe need is a military victory…. The news of an armistice ispremature. Our Staff will be ready to conclude an armistice when theenemy can no longer do any harm….“At present, the influence of our victory is creating new politicalconditions…. To-day the Socialist Revolutionaries are inclined areinclined to admit the Bolsheviki into the new Government…. A decisivevictory is indispensable, so that those who hesitate will have nofurther hesitation….”At the City Duma all attention was concentrated on the formation ofthe new Government. In many factories and barracks alreadyRevolutionary Tribunals were operating, and the Bolsheviki werethreatening to set up more of these, and try Gotz and Avksentievbefore them. Dan proposed that an ultimatum be sent demanding theabolition of these Revolutionary Tribunals, or the other members ofthe Conference would immediately break off all negotiations with theBolsheviki.Shingariov, Cadet, declared that the Municipality ought not to takepart in any agreement with the Bolsheviki…. “Any agreement with themaniacs is impossible until they lay down their arms and recognisethe authority of independent courts of law….”Yartsev, for the _Yedinstvo_ group, declared that any agreement withthe Bolsheviki would be equivalent to a Bolshevik victory….Mayor Schreider, for the Socialist Revolutionaries, stated that hewas opposed to all agreement with the Bolsheviki…. “As for aGovernment, that ought to spring from the popular will; and since thepopular will has been expressed in the municipal elections, thepopular will which can create a Government is actually concentratedin the Duma….”After other speakers, of which only the representative of theMensheviki Internationalists was in favour of considering theadmission of the Bolsheviki into the new Government, the Duma votedto continue its representatives in the _Vikzhel’s_ conference, but toinsist upon the restoration of the Provisional Government beforeeverything, and to exclude the Bolsheviki from the new power….                                 3.        TRUCE. KRASNOV’s ANSWER TO THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION“In answer to your telegram proposing an immediate armistice, theSupreme Commander, not wishing further futile bloodshed, consents toenter into negotiations and to establish relations between the armiesof the Government and the insurrectionists. He proposes to theGeneral Staff of the insurrectionists to recall its regiments toPetrograd, to declare the line Ligovo-Pulkovo-Colpinno neutral, andto allow the advance-guards of the Government cavalry to enterTsarskoye Selo, for the purpose of establishing order. The answer tothis proposal must be placed in the hands of our envoys before eighto’clock to-morrow morning.                                                KRASNOV.”                                 4.                        EVENTS AT TSARSKOYE SELOOn the evening that Kerensky’s troops retreated from Tsarskoye Selo,some priests organised a religious procession through the streets ofthe town, making speeches to the citizens in which they asked thepeople to support the rightful authority, the Provisional Government.When the Cossacks had retreated, and the first Red Guards entered thetown, witnesses reported that the priests had incited the peopleagainst the Soviets, and had said prayers at the grave of Rasputin,which lies behind the Imperial Palace. One of the priests, FatherIvan Kutchurov, was arrested and shot by the infuriated Red Guards….Just as the Red Guards entered the town the electric lights were shutoff, plunging the streets in complete darkness. The director of theelectric light plant, Lubovitch, was arrested by the Soviet troopsand asked why he had shut off the lights. He was found some timelater in the room where he had been imprisoned with a revolver in hishand and a bullet hole in his temple.The Petrograd anti-Bolshevik papers came out next day with headlines,“Plekhanov’s temperature 39 degrees!” Plekhanov lived at TsarskoyeSelo, where he was lying ill in bed. Red Guards arrived at the houseand searched it for arms, questioning the old man.“What class of society do you belong to?” they asked him.“I am a revolutionist,” answered Plekhanov, “who for forty years hasdevoted his life to the struggle for liberty!”“Anyway,” said a workman, “you have now sold yourself to thebourgeoisie!”The workers no longer knew Plekhanov, pioneer of the Russian SocialDemocracy!                                 5.                    APPEAL OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT“The detachments at Gatchina, deceived by Kerensky, have laid downtheir arms and decided to arrest Kerensky. That chief of thecounter-revolutionary campaign has fled. The Army, by an enormousmajority, has pronounced in favour of the second All-Russian Congressof Soviets, and of the Government which it has created. Scores ofdelegates from the Front have hastened to Petrograd to assure theSoviet Government of the Army’s fidelity. No twisting of the facts,no calumny against the revolutionary workers, soldiers, and peasants,has been able to defeat the People. The Workers’ and Soldiers’Revolution is victorious….“The _Tsay-ee-kah_ appeals to the troops which march under the flagof the counter-revolution, and invites them immediately to lay downtheir arms—to shed no longer the blood of their brothers in theinterests of a handful of land-owners and capitalists. The Workers’,Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Revolution curses those who remain even for amoment under the flag of the People’s enemies….“Cossacks! Come over to the rank of the victorious People!Railwaymen, postmen, telegraphers—all, all support the new Governmentof the People!”                        APPENDIX TO CHAPTER X                                 1.                        DAMAGE TO THE KREMLINI myself verified the damage to the Kremlin, which I visitedimmediately after the bombardment. The Little Nicolai Palace, abuilding of no particular importance, which was occupied occasionallyby receptions of one of the Grand Duchesses, had served as barracksfor the _yunkers._ It was not only bombarded, but pretty well sacked;fortunately there was nothing in it of particular historical value.Usspensky Cathedral had a shell-hole in one of the cupolas, butexcept for a few feet of mosaic in the ceiling, was undamaged. Thefrescoes on the porch of Blagovestchensky Cathedral were badlydamaged by a shell. Another shell hit the corner of Ivan Veliki.Tchudovsky Monastery was hit about thirty times, but only one shellwent through a window into the interior, the others breaking thebrick window-moulding and the roof cornices.The clock over the Spasskaya Gate was smashed. Troitsky Gate wasbattered, but easily reparable. One of the lower towers had lost itsbrick spire.The church of St. Basil was untouched, as was the great ImperialPalace, with all the treasures of Moscow and Petrograd in its cellar,and the crown jewels in the Treasury. These places were not evenentered.                                 2.                        LUNATCHARSKY’s DECLARATION“Comrades! You are the young masters of the country, and although nowyou have much to do and think about, you must know how to defend yourartistic and scientific treasures.“Comrades! That which is happening at Moscow is a horrible,irreparable misfortune…. The People in its struggle for the power hasmutilated our glorious capital.“It is particularly terrible in these days of violent struggle, ofdestructive warfare, to be Commissar of Public Education. Only thehope of the victory of Socialism, the source of a new and superiorculture, brings me comfort. On me weighs the responsibility ofprotecting the artistic wealth of the people…. Not being able toremain at my post, where I had no influence, I resigned. My comrades,the other Commissars, considered this resignation inadmissible. Ishall therefore remain at my post…. And moreover, I understand thatthe damage done to the Kremlin is not as serious as has beenreported….“But I beg you, comrades, to give me your support…. Preserve foryourselves and your descendants the beauty of our land; be theguardians of the property of the People.“Soon, very soon, even the most ignorant, who have been held inignorance so long, will awake and understand what a source of joy,strength and wisdom is art….”                                 3.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS CHAPTERThis chapter extends over a period of two months, more or less. Itcovers the time of negotiations with the Allies, the negotiations andarmistice with the Germans, and the beginning of the Peacenegotiations at Brest-Litovsk, as well as the period in which werelaid the foundations of the Soviet State.However, it is no part of my purpose in this book to describe andinterpret these very important historical events, which require morespace. They are therefore reserved for another volume, "Kornilov toBrest-Litovsk."In this chapter, then, I have confined myself to the SovietGovernment's attempts to consolidate its political power at home, andsketched its successive conquests of hostile domestic elements—whichprocess was temporarily interrupted by the disastrous Peace ofBrest-Litovsk.                                 2.        PREAMBLE—DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIAThe October Revolution of the workers and peasants began under thecommon banner of Emancipation.The peasants are being emancipated from the power of the landowners,for there is no longer the landowner's property right in the land—ithas been abolished. The soldiers and sailors are being emancipatedfrom the power of autocratic generals, for generals will henceforthbe elective and subject to recall. The workingmen are beingemancipated from the whims and arbitrary will of the capitalists, forhenceforth there will be established the control of the workers overmills and factories. Everything living and capable of life is beingemancipated from the hateful shackles.There remain only the peoples of Russia, who have suffered and aresuffering oppression and arbitrariness, and whose emancipation mustimmediately be begun, whose liberation must be effected resolutelyand definitely.During the period of Tsarism the peoples of Russia weresystematically incited against one another. The result of such apolicy are known: massacres and _pogroms_ on the one hand, slavery ofpeoples on the other.There can be and there must be no return to this disgraceful policy.Henceforth the policy of a voluntary and honest union of the peoplesof Russia must be substituted.In the period of imperialism, after the March revolution, when thepower was transferred into the hands of the Cadet bourgeoisie, thenaked policy of provocation gave way to one of cowardly distrust ofthe peoples of Russia, to a policy of fault-finding, of meaningless"freedom" and "equality" of peoples. The results of such a policy areknown: the growth of national enmity, the impairment of mutualconfidence.An end must be put to this unworthy policy of falsehood and distrust,of fault-finding and provocation. Henceforth it must be replaced byan open and honest policy leading to the complete mutual confidenceof the peoples of Russia. Only as the result of such a trust canthere be formed an honest and lasting union of the peoples of Russia.Only as the result of such a union can the workers and peasants ofthe peoples of Russia be cemented into one revolutionary force ableto resist all attempts on the part of the imperialist-annexationistbourgeoisie.                                 3.                              DECREES                _On the Nationalisation of the Banks_In the interest of the regular organisation of the national economy,of the thorough eradication of bank speculation and the completeemancipation of the workers, peasants, and the whole labouringpopulation from the exploitation of banking capital, and with a viewto the establishment of a single national bank of the RussianRepublic which shall serve the real interests of the people and thepoorer classes, the Central Executive Committee _(Tsay-ee-kah)_resolves:1. The banking business is declared a state monopoly.2. All existing private joint-stock banks and banking offices aremerged in the State Bank.3. The assets and liabilities of the liquidated establishments aretaken over by the State Bank.4. The order of the merger of private banks in the State Bank is tobe determined by a special decree.5. The temporary administration of the affairs of the private banksis entrusted to the board of the State Bank.6. The interests of the small depositors will be safeguarded.                        *   *   *   *   *                _On the Equality of Rank of All Military Men_In realisation of the will of the revolutionary people regarding theprompt and decisive abolition of all remnants of former inequality inthe Army, the Council of People's Commissars decrees:1. All ranks and grades in the Army, beginning with the rank ofCorporal and ending with the rank of General, are abolished. The Armyof the Russian Republic consists now of free and equal citizens,bearing the honourable title of Soldiers of the Revolutionary Army.2. All privileges connected with the former ranks and grades, alsoall outward marks of distinction, are abolished.3. All addressing by titles is abolished.4. All decorations, orders, and other marks of distinction areabolished.5. With the abolition of the rank of officer, all separate officers'organisations are abolished.Note.—Orderlies are left only for headquarters, chanceries,Committees and other Army organisations.                _President of the Council of People's Commissars,_                                        VL.

The army serving the will of the toiling people is subject to itssupreme representative—the Council of People's Commissars.2. Full authority within the limits of military units andcombinations is vested in the respective Soldiers' Committees andSoviets.3. Those phases of the life and activity of the troops which arealready under the jurisdiction of the Committees are now formallyplaced in their direct control. Over such branches of activity whichthe Committees cannot assume, the control of the Soldiers' Soviets isestablished.4. The election of commanding Staff and officers is introduced. Allcommanders up to the commanders of regiments, inclusive, are electedby general suffrage of squads, platoons, companies, squadrons,batteries, divisions (artillery, 2-3 batteries), and regiments. Allcommanders higher than the commander of a regiment, and up to theSupreme Commander, inclusive, are elected by congresses orconferences of Committees.Note.—By the term "conference" must be understood a meeting of therespective Committees together with delegates of committees onedegree lower in rank. (Such as a "conference" of RegimentalCommittees with delegates from Company Committees.—Author.)5.

RIDICULE OF THE NEW RÉGIME        From _Drug Naroda_ (Menshevik), November 18th:"The story of the 'immediate peace' of the Bolsheviki reminds us of ajoyous moving-picture film…. Neratov runs—Trotzky pursues; Neratovclimbs a wall, Trotzky too; Neratov dives into the water—Trotzkyfollows; Neratov climbs onto the roof—Trotzky right behind him;Neratov hides under the bed—and Trotzky has him! He has him!Naturally, peace is immediately signed…."All is empty and silent at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thecouriers are respectful, but their faces wear a caustic expression…."How about arresting an ambassador and signing an armistice or aPeace Treaty with him? But they are strange folk, these ambassadors.They keep silent just as if they had heard nothing. Hola, hola,England, France, Germany! We have signed an armistice with you! Is itpossible that you know nothing about it? Nevertheless, it has beenpublished in all the papers and posted on all the walls. On aBolshevik's word of honour, Peace has been signed. We're not askingmuch of you; you just have to write two words…."The ambassadors remain silent. The Powers remain silent. All isempty and silent in the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs."'Listen,' says Robespierre-Trotzky to his assistant Marat-Uritzky,'run over to the British Ambassador's, tell him we're proposingpeace!'"'Go yourself,' says Marat-Uritzky. 'He's not receiving.'"'Telephone him, then.'"'I've tried. The receiver's off the hook.'"'Send him a telegram.'"'I did.'"'Well, with what result?'"Marat-Uritzky sighs and does not answer. Robespierre-Trotzky spitsfuriously into the corner…."'Listen, Marat,' recommences Trotzky, after a moment. 'We mustabsolutely show that we're conducting an active foreign policy. Howcan we do that?'"'Launch another decree about arresting Neratov,' answers Uritzky,with a profound air."'Marat, you're a blockhead!' cries Trotzky. All of a sudden hearises, terrible and majestic, looking at this moment likeRobespierre."'Write, Uritzky!' he says with severity. 'Write a letter to theBritish ambassador, a registered letter with receipt demanded. Write!I also will write! The peoples of the world await an immediate peace!'"In the enormous and empty Ministry of Foreign Affairs are to beheard only the sound of two typewriters. With his own hands Trotzkyis conducting an active foreign policy…."                                 6.                ON THE QUESTION OF AN AGREEMENTTo the Attention of All Workers and All Soldiers.November 11th, in the club of the Preobrazhensky Regiment, was heldan extraordinary meeting of representatives of all the units of thePetrograd garrison.The meeting was called upon the initiative of the Preobrazhensky andSemionovsky Regiments, for the discussion of the question as to whichSocialist parties are for the power of the Soviets, which areagainst, which are for the people, which against, and if an agreementbetween them is possible.The representatives of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ of the Municipal Duma, ofthe Avksentiev Peasants' Soviets, and of all the political partiesfrom the Bolsheviki to the Populist Socialists, were invited to themeeting.After long deliberation, having heard the declarations of all partiesand organisations, the meeting by a tremendous majority of votesagreed that only the Bolsheviki and the Left SocialistRevolutionaries are for the people, and that all the other partiesare only attempting, under cover of seeking an agreement, to deprivethe people of the conquests won in the days of the great Workers' andPeasants' Revolution of November.Here is the text of the resolution carried at this meeting of thePetrograd garrison, by 61 votes against 11, and 12 not voting:"The garrison conference, summoned at the initiative of theSemionovsky and Preobrazhensky Regiments, on hearing therepresentatives of all the Socialist parties and popularorganisations on the question of an agreement between the differentpolitical parties finds that:"1. The representatives of the _Tasy-ee-kah,_ the representatives ofthe Bolshevik party and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, declareddefinitely that they stand for a Government of the Soviets, for thedecrees on Land, Peace and Workers' Control of Industry, and thatupon this platform they are willing to agree with all the Socialistparties."2. At the same time the representatives of the other parties(Mensheviki, Socialist Revolutionaries) either gave no answer at all,or declared simply that they were opposed to the power of the Sovietsand against the decrees on Land, Peace and Workers' Control."In view of this the meeting resolves:"'1. To express severe censure of all parties which, under cover ofan agreement, wish practically to annul the popular conquests of theRevolution of November."2. To express full confidence in the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and the Councilof People's Commissars, and to promise them complete support.'"At the same time the meeting deems it necessary that the comradesLeft Socialist Revolutionaries should enter the People's Government."                                 7.                           WINE "POGROMS"It was afterward discovered that there was a regular organisation,maintained by the Cadets, for provoking rioting among the soldiers.There would be telephone messages to the different barracks,announcing that wine was being given away at such and such anaddress, and when the soldiers arrived at the spot an individualwould point out the location of the cellar….The Council of People's Commissars appointed a Commissar for theFight Against Drunkenness, who, besides mercilessly putting down thewine riots, destroyed hundreds of thousands of bottles of liquor. TheWinter Palace cellars, containing rare vintages valued at more thanfive million dollars, were at first flooded, and then the liquor wasremoved to Cronstadt and destroyed.In this work the Cronstadt sailors, "flower and pride of therevolutionary forces," as Trotzky called them, acquitted themselveswith iron selfdicipline….                                 8.

The city is cut off fromthe outside world and is entirely in the power of the Bolsheviki….People are arrested in the streets, thrown into the Neva, drowned andimprisoned without any charge. Even Burtzev is shut up in Peter-Paulfortress, under strict guard."The organisation at whose head I am is working without rest to uniteall the officers and what is left of the _yunker_ schools, and to armthem. The situation cannot be saved except by creating regiments ofofficers and _yunkers._ Attacking with these regiments, and havinggained a first success, we could later gain the aid of the garrisontroops; but without that first success it is impossible to count on asingle soldier, because thousands of them are divided and terrorisedby the scum which exists in every regiment. Most of the Cossacks aretainted by Bolshevik propaganda, thanks to the strange policy ofGeneral Dutov, who allowed to pass the moment when by decisive actionsomething could have been obtained. The policy of negotiations andconcessions has borne its fruits; all that is respectable ispersecuted, and it is the _plebe_ and the criminals who dominate—andnothing can be done except by shooting and hanging them."We are awaiting you here, General, and at the moment of yourarrival, we shall advance with all the forces at our disposal. Butfor that we must establish some communication with you, and beforeall, clear up the following points:"(1) Do you know that in your name all officers who could take partin the fight are being invited to leave Petrograd on the pretext ofjoining you?"(2) About when can we count on your arrival at Petrograd? We shouldlike to know in order to coordinate our actions."In spite of the criminal inaction of the conscious people here,which allowed the yoke of Bolshevism to be laid upon us—in spite ofthe extraordinary pig—headedness of the majority of officers, sodifficult to organise— we believe in spite of all that Truth is onour side, and that we shall conquer the vicious and criminal forceswho say that they are acting for motives of love of country and inorder to save it. Whatever comes, we shall not permit ourselves to bestruck down, and shall remain firm until the end."Purishkevitch, being brought to trial before the RevolutionaryTribunal, was given a short prison term….                                10.

Every conscious worker understandsperfectly that we cannot avoid this hostility, because the highofficials have set themselves against the People and do not wish toabandon their posts without resistance.

We have justice on our side. Ourultimate victory is certain."The resistance of the capitalists and high officials will be broken.No one will be deprived of his property without a special law on thenationalisation of banks and financial syndicates. This law is inpreparation. Not a worker will lose a single kopek; on the contrary,he will be assisted.

Remember that you yourselves direct theGovernment. No one will help you unless you organise yourselves andtake into your own hands the affairs of the State. Your Soviets arenow the organs of governmental power…. Strengthen them, establish asevere revolutionary control, pitilessly crush the attempts atanarchy on the part of drunkards, brigands, counter-revolutionary_yunkers_ and Kornilovists."Establish a strict control over production and the accounting forproducts. Arrest and turn over to the Revolutionary Tribunal of thePeople every one who injures the property of the People, by sabotagein production, by concealment of grain-reserves, reserves of otherproducts, by retarding the shipments of grain, by bringing confusioninto the railroads, the posts and the telegraphs, or in generalopposing the great work of bringing Peace and transferring the Landto the peasants…."Comrades workers, soldiers, peasants—all toilers!"Take immediately all local power into your hands…. Little by little,with the consent of the majority of peasants, we shall march firmlyand unhesitatingly toward the victory of Socialism, which willfortify the advance-guards of the working-class of the most civilisedCountries, and give to the peoples an enduring peace, and free themfrom every slavery and every exploitation."                                13._"To All Workers of Petrograd!_"Comrades! The Revolution is winning—the revolution has won. All thepower has passed over to our Soviets. The first weeks are the mostdifficult ones.

FROM THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARS TO THE TOILING COSSACKS_“Brothers-Cossacks._“You are being deceived. You are being incited against the People.You are told that the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’Deputies are your enemies, that they want to take away your Cossackland, your Cossack ‘liberty’. Don’t believe it, Cossacks…. Your ownGenerals and landowners are deceiving you, in order to keep you indarkness and slavery.  We, the Council of People’s Commissars,address ourselves to you, Cossacks, with these words. Read themattentively and judge yourselves which is the truth and which iscruel deceit. The life and service of a Cossack were always bondageand penal servitude. At the first call of the authorities a Cossackalways had to saddle his horse and ride out on campaign. All hismilitary equipment a Cossack had to provide with his own hardlyearned means. A Cossack is on service, his farm is going to rack andruin. Is such a condition fair? No, it must be altered for ever. THECOSSACKS MUST BE FREED FROM BONDAGE. The new People’s Soviet power iswilling to come to the assistance of the toiling Cossacks. It is onlynecessary that the Cossacks themselves should resolve to abolish theold order, that they should refuse submission to their slave-driverofficers, land-owners, rich men, that they should throw off thecursed yoke from their necks. Arise, Cossacks! Unite! The Council ofPeople’s Commissars calls upon you to enter a new, fresh, more happylife.“In November and December in Petrograd there were All-RussianCongresses of Soviets of Soldiers’, Workers’, and Peasants’ Deputies.These Congresses transferred all the authority in the differentlocalities into the hands of the Soviets, i.e., into the hands of menelected by the People. From now on there must be in Russia no rulersor functionaries who command the People from above and drive them.The People create the authority themselves. A General has no morerights than a soldier. All are equal. Consider, Cossacks, is thiswrong or right? We are calling upon you, Cossacks, to join this neworder and to create your own Soviets of Cossacks’ Deputies. To suchSoviets all the power must belong in the different localities. Not to_hetmans_ with the rank of General, but to the electedrepresentatives of the toiling Cossacks, to your own trustworthyreliable men.“The All-Russian Congresses of Soldiers’, Workers’, and Peasants’Deputies have passed a resolution to transfer all landowners’ landinto the possession of the toiling people. Is not that fair,Cossacks? The Kornilovs, Kaledins, Dutovs, Karaulovs, Bardizhes, alldefend with their whole souls the interests of the rich men, and theyare ready to drown Russia in blood if only the lands remain in thehands of the landowners. But you, the toiling Cossacks, do not yousuffer yourselves from poverty, oppression and lack of land? How manyCossacks are there who have more than 4-5 _dessiatins_ per head? Butthe landowners, who have thousands of _dessiatins_ of their own land,wish besides to get into their hands the lands of the Cossack Army.According to the new Soviet laws, the lands of Cossack landownersmust pass without compensation into the hands of the Cossack workers,the poorer Cossacks. You are being told that the Soviets wish to takeaway your lands from you. Who is frightening you? The rich Cossacks,who know that the Soviet AUTHORITY WISHES TO transfer the landowners’lands to you. Choose then, Cossacks, for whom will you stand: for theKornilovs and Kaledins, for the Generals and rich men, or for theSoviets of Peasants’, Soldiers’, Workers’ and Cossacks’ Deputies.“THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARS elected by the All-RussianCongress HAS PROPOSED TO ALL NATIONS AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE AND ANHONOURABLE DEMOCRATIC PEACE WITHOUT LOSS OR DETRIMENT TO ANY NATION.All the capitalists, landowners, Generals-Kornilovists have risenagainst the peaceful policy of the Soviets. The war was bringing themprofits, power, distinctions. And to you, Cossack privates? You wereperishing without reason, without purpose, like yourbrothers-soldiers and sailors. It will soon be three years and a halfthat this accursed war has gone on, a war devised by the capitalistsand landowners of all countries for their own profit, their worldrobberies. To the toiling Cossacks the war has only brought ruin anddeath. The war has drained all the resources from Cossack farm life.The only salvation for the whole of our country and for the Cossacksin  particular is a prompt and honest peace. The Council of People’sCommissars has declared to all Governments and peoples: We do notwant other people’s property, and we do not wish to give away ourown. Peace without annexations and without indemnities. Every nationmust decide its own fate. There must be no oppressing of one nationby another. Such is the honest, democratic, People’s peace which theCouncil of People’s Commissars is proposing to all Governments, toall peoples, allies and enemies. And the results are visible: ON THERUSSIAN FRONT AN ARMISTICE HAS BEEN CONCLUDED.“The soldier’s and the Cossack’s blood is not flowing there any more.Now, Cossacks, decide: do you wish to continue this ruinous,senseless, criminal slaughter? Then support the Cadets, the enemiesof the people, support Tchernov, Tseretelli, Skobeliev, who drove youinto the offensive of July 1st; support Kornilov, who introducedcapital punishment for soldiers and Cossacks at the front. BUT IF YOUWISH A PROMPT AND HONEST PEACE, THEN ENTER THE RANKS OF THE SOVIETSAND SUPPORT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARS.“Your fate, Cossacks, lies in your own hands. Our common foes, thelandowners, capitalists, officers-Kornilovists, bourgeois newspapers,are deceiving you and driving you along the road to ruin. InOrenburg, Dutov has arrested the Soviet and disarmed the garrison.Kaledin is threatening the Soviets in the province of the Don. He hasdeclared the province to be in a state of war and is assembling histroops. Karaulov is shooting the local tribes in the Caucasus. TheCadet bourgeoisie is supplying them with its millions. Their commonaim is to suppress the People’s Soviets, to crush the workers andpeasants, to introduce again the discipline of the whip in the army,and to eternalise the bondage of the toiling Cossacks.“Our revolutionary troops are moving to the Don and the Ural in orderto put an end to this criminal revolt against the people. Thecommanders of the revolutionary troops have received orders not toenter into any negotiations with the mutinous Generals, to actdecisively and mercilessly.“Cossacks! On you depends now whether your brothers’ blood is to flowstill. We are holding out our hand to you. Join the whole peopleagainst its enemies. Declare Kaledin, Kornilov, Dutov, Karaulov andall their aiders and abettors to be the enemies of the people,traitors and betrayers. Arrest them with your own forces and turnthem over into the hands of the Soviet authority, which will judgethem in open and public Revolutionary Tribunal. Cossacks! FormSoviets of Cossacks’ Deputies. Take into your toil-worn hands themanagement of all the affairs of the Cossacks. Take away the lands ofyour own wealthy landowners. Take over their grain, their inventoriedproperty and live-stock for the cultivation of the lands of thetoiling Cossacks, who are ruined by the war.“Forward, Cossacks, to the fight for the common cause of the people!“Long live the toiling Cossacks!“Long live the union of the Cossacks, the soldiers, peasants andworkers!“Long live the power of the Soviets of Cossacks’, Soldiers’, Workers’and Peasants’ Deputies.“Down with the war! Down with the landowners and theKornilovist-Generals!“Long live Peace and the Brotherhood of peoples!”                                _Council of People’s Commissars._                                17.    FROM THE COMMISSION ON PUBLIC EDUCATION ATTACHED TO THE CENTRAL                            CITY DUMA“Comrades Workingmen and Workingwomen!“A few days before the holidays, a strike has been declared by theteachers of the public schools. The teachers side with thebourgeoisie against the Workers’ and Peasants’ Government.“Comrades, organise parents’ committees and pass resolutions againstthe strike of the teachers. Propose to the Ward Soviets of Workers’and Soldiers’ Deputies, the Trade Unions, the Factory-Shop and PartyCommittees, to organise protest meetings. Arrange with your ownresources Christmas trees and entertainments for the children, anddemand the opening of the schools, after the holidays, at the datewhich will be set by the Duma.“Comrades, strengthen your position in matters of public education,insist on the control of the proletarian organisations over theschools.”      _Commission on Public Education attached to the Central City Duma._                                18.        DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENTThe notes issued by Trotzky to the Allies and to the neutral powers,as well as the note of the Allied military Attachés to GeneralDukhonin, are too voluminous to give here. Moreover they belong toanother phase of the history of the Soviet Republic, with which thisbook has nothing to do—the foreign relations of the SovietGovernment. This I treat at length in the next volume, “Kornilov toBrest-Litovsk.”                                19.                APPEALS TO THE FRONT AGAINST DUKHONIN“… The struggle for peace has met with the resistance of thebourgeoisie and the counter-revolutionary Generals…. From theaccounts in the newspapers, at the _Stavka_ of former SupremeCommander Dukhonin are gathering the agents and allies of thebourgeoisie, Verkhovski, Avksentiev, Tchernov, Gotz, Tseretelli, etc.It seems even that they want to form a new power against the Soviets.“Comrades soldiers! All the persons we have mentioned have beenMinisters already. They have acted in accord with Kerensky and thebourgeoisie. They are responsible for the offensive of July 1st andfor the prolongation of the war. They promised the land to thepeasants and then arrested the Land Committees. They reestablishedcapital punishment for soldiers. They obey the orders of French,English and American financiers….“General Dukhonin, for having refused to obey orders of the Councilof People’s Commissars, has been dismissed from his position asSupreme Commander…. For answer he is circulating among the troops thenote from the Military Attachés of the Allied imperialist Powers, andattempting to provoke a counter-revolution….“Do not obey Dukhonin! Pay no attention to his provocation! Watch himand his group of counter-revolutionary Generals carefully….”                                20.                            FROM KRYLENKO                           _Order Number Two_“… The ex-Supreme Commander, General Dukhonin, for having opposedresistance to the execution of orders, for criminal actionsusceptible of provoking a new civil war, is declared enemy of thePeople. All persons who support Dukhonin will be arrested, withoutrespect to their social or political position or their past. Personsequipped with special authority will operate these arrests. I chargeGeneral Manikhovsky with the execution of the above-mentioneddispositions….”                     APPENDIX TO CHAPTER XII                                 1.                     INSTRUCTION TO PEASANTSIn answer to the numerous enquiries coming from peasants, it ishereby explained that the whole power in the country is from now onheld by the Soviets of the Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’Deputies. The Workers’ Revolution, after having conquered inPetrograd and in Moscow, is now conquering in all other centres ofRussia. The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government safeguards theinterests of the masses of peasantry, the poorest of them; it is withthe majority of peasants and workers against the landowners, andagainst the capitalists.Hence the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, and before all the DistrictSoviets, and subsequently those of the Provinces, are from now on anduntil the Constituent Assembly meets, full-powered bodies of Stateauthority in their localities. All landlords’ titles to the land arecancelled by the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets. A decreeregarding the land has already been issued by the present ProvisionalWorkers’ and Peasants’ Government. On the basis of the above decreeall lands hitherto belonging to landlords now pass entirely andwholly into the hands of the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies. The_Volost_ (a group of several villages forms a _Volost_) LandCommittees are immediately to take over all land from the landlords,and to keep a strict account over it, watching that order bemaintained, and that the whole estate be well guarded, seeing thatfrom now on all private estates become public property and musttherefore be protected by the people themselves.All orders given by the _Volost_ Land Committees, adopted with theassent of the District Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, in fulfilmentof the decrees issued by the revolutionary power, are absolutelylegal and are to be forthwith and irrefutably brought into execution.The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government appointed by the secondAll-Russian Congress of Soviets has received the name of the Councilof People’s Commissars.The Council of People’s Commissars summons the Peasants to take thewhole power into their hands in every locality.The workers will in every way absolutely and entirely support thepeasants, arrange for them all that is required in connection withmachines and tools, and in return they request the peasants to helpwith the transport of grain.                  _President of the Council of People’s Commissars,_                                       V. ULIANOV (LENIN).Petrograd, November 18th, 1917.                                 2.The full-powered Congress of Peasants’ Soviets met about a weeklater, and continued for several weeks. Its history is merely anexpanded version of the history of the “Extraordinary Conference.” Atfirst the great majority of the delegates were hostile to the SovietGovernment, and supported the reactionary wing. Several days laterthe assembly was supporting the moderates with Tchernov. And severaldays after that the vast majority of the Congress were voting for thefaction of Maria Spiridonova, and sending their representatives intothe _Tsay-ee-kah_ at Smolny…. The Right Wing then walked out of theCongress and called a Congress of its own, which went on, dwindlingfrom day to day, until it finally dissolved….THE JUNIOR CLASSICSSELECTED AND ARRANGED BYWILLIAM PATTEN, MANAGING EDITOR OF THE HARVARD CLASSICSINTRODUCTION BY CHARLES W. ELIOT, LL.D., PRESIDENT EMERITUS OF HARVARDUNIVERSITYWITH A READING GUIDE BY WILLIAM ALLAN NEILSON, Ph. D., PROFESSOR OFENGLISH, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, PRESIDENT SMITH COLLEGE, NORTHAMPTON,MASS., SINCE 1917VOLUME ONEFairy and Wonder TalesINTRODUCTIONThe purpose of The Junior Classics is to provide, in ten volumescontaining about five thousand pages, a classified collection of tales,stories, and poems, both ancient and modern, suitable for boys andgirls of from six to sixteen years of age.  Thoughtful parents andteachers, who realize the evils of indiscriminate reading on the partof children, will appreciate the educational value of such acollection.  A child's taste in reading is formed, as a rule, in thefirst ten or twelve years of its life, and experience has shown thatthe childish mind will prefer good literature to any other, if accessto it is made easy, and will develop far better on literature of provedmerit than on trivial or transitory material.The boy or girl who becomes familiar with the charming tales and poemsin this collection will have gained a knowledge of literature andhistory that will be of high value in other school and home work.  Hereare the real elements of imaginative narration, poetry, and ethics,which should enter into the education of every English-speaking child.This collection, carefully used by parents and teachers with duereference to individual tastes and needs, will make many children enjoygood literature.  It will inspire them with a love of good reading,which is the best possible result of any elementary education.  Thechild himself should be encouraged to make his own selections from thislarge and varied collection, the child's enjoyment being the object inview.  A real and lasting interest in literature or in scholarship isonly to be developed through the individual's enjoyment of his mentaloccupations.The most important change which has been made in American schools andcolleges within my memory is the substitution of leading for driving,of inspiration for drill, of personal interest and love of work forcompulsion and fear.  The schools are learning to use methods andmaterials which interest and attract the children themselves.  TheJunior Classics will put into the home the means of using this happymethod.Committing to memory beautiful pieces of literature, either prose orpoetry, for recitation before a friendly audience, acting charades orplays, and reading aloud with vivacity and sympathetic emotion, aregood means of instruction at home or at school This collection containsnumerous admirable pieces of literature for such use.  In teachingEnglish and English literature we should place more reliance uponprocesses and acts which awaken emotion, stimulate interest, prove tobe enjoyable for the actors, and result in giving children the power ofentertaining people, of blessing others with noble pleasures which thechildren create and share.>From the home training during childhood there should result in thechild a taste for interesting and improving reading which will directand inspire its subsequent intellectual life.  The training whichresults in this taste for good reading, however unsystematic oreccentric it may have been, has achieved one principal aim ofeducation; and any school or home training which does not result inimplanting this permanent taste has failed in a very important respect.Guided and animated by this impulse to acquire knowledge and exercisethe imagination through good reading, the adult will continue toeducate him all through life.The story of the human race through all its slow development should begradually conveyed to the child's mind from the time he begins to read,or to listen to his mother reading; and with description of facts andactual events should be mingled charming and uplifting products of theimagination.  To try to feed the minds of children upon facts alone isundesirable and unwise.  The immense product of the imagination in artand literature is a concrete fact with which every educated human beingshould be made somewhat familiar, that product being a very real partof every individual's actual environment.The right selection of reading matter for children is obviously of highimportance.  Some of the mythologies, Old Testament stories, fairytales, and historical romances, on which earlier generations wereaccustomed to feed the childish mind, contain a great deal that isbarbarous, perverse, or cruel; and to this infiltration into children'sminds, generation after generation, of immoral, cruel, or foolish ideasis probably to be attributed in part the slow ethical progress of therace.  The commonest justification of this thoughtless practice is thatchildren do not apprehend the evil in the bad mental pictures withwhich we foolishly supply them; but what should we think of a motherwho gave her children dirty milk or porridge, on the theory that thechildren would not assimilate the dirt?  Should we be less carefulabout mental and moral food materials?  The Junior Classics have beenselected with this principle in mind, without losing sight of the factthat every developing human being needs to have a vision of the roughand thorny road over which the human race has been slowly advancingduring thousands of years.Whoever has committed to memory in childhood such Bible extracts asGenesis i, the Ten Commandments, Psalm xxiii, Matthew v, 8-12, TheLord's Prayer, and I Corinthians xiii, such English prose as Lincoln'sGettysburg speech, Bacon's "Essay on Truth," and such poems as Bryant's"Waterfowl," Addison's "Divine Ode," Milton's Sonnet on his Blindness,Wotton's "How happy is he born or taught," Emerson's "Rhodora,"Holmes's "Chambered Nautilus," and Gray's Elegy, and has stamped themon his brain by frequent repetition, will have set up in his mind highstandards of noble thought and feeling, true patriotism, and purereligion.  He will also have laid in an invaluable store of goodEnglish.While the majority of the tales and poems are intended for children whohave begun to do their own reading, there will be found in every volumeselections fit for reading aloud to younger children.  Throughout thecollection the authors tell the stories in their own words; so that thesalt which gave them savor is preserved.  There are some condensationshowever, such as any good teller of borrowed stories would make; but asa rule condensation has been applied only in the case of long workswhich otherwise could not have been included.  The notes which precedethe condensations supply explanations, and answer questions whichexperience has shown boys and girls are apt to ask about the workscondensed or their authors.The Junior Classics constitute a set of books whose contents willdelight children and at the same time satisfy the legitimate ethicalrequirements of those who have the children's best interests at heart.Charles W.

There must have been fairy tales (or fables, or folktales, or myths, or whatever name we choose to give them) ever sincethe world began.  They are not exclusively French, German, Greek,Russian, Indian or Chinese, but are the common property of the wholehuman family and are as universal as human speech.All the world over, fairy tales are found to be pretty much the same.The story of Cinderella is found in all countries.  Japan has a Rip VanWinkle, China has a Beauty and the Beast, Egypt has a Puss in Boots,and Persia has a Jack and the Beanstalk.Those wise people who have made a careful study of literature, andespecially of what we call folk tales or fairy tales or fables ormyths, tell us that they all typify in some way the constant strugglethat is going on in every department of life.  It may be the struggleof Summer against Winter, the bright Day against dark Night, Innocenceagainst Cruelty, of Knowledge against Ignorance.  We are not obliged tothink of these delightful stories as each having a meaning.  Ourenjoyment of them will not be less if we overlook that side, but it mayhelp us to understand and appreciate good books if we remember that theliterature of the world is the story of man's struggle against nature;that the beginnings of literature came out of the mouths of story-tellers, and that the stories they told were fairy tales-imaginativestories based on truth.There is one important fact to remember in connection with the oldfairy tales, and that is that they were repeated aloud from memory, notread from a book or manuscript.The printing of books from type may be said to date from the year 1470,when Caxton introduced printing into England.  It is said that thefirst book printed in English which had the pages numbered was a bookof tales, "Aesop's Fables."As late as 1600 printed books were still so rare that only rich mencould own them.  There was one other way of printing a story-onsheepskin (split and made into parchment) with a pen-but that was along and laborious art that could only be practiced by educated men whohad been taught to write.  The monks were about the only men who hadthe necessary education and time, and they cared more for making copiesof the Bible and Lives of the Saints than they did of fairy tales.  Thecommon people, and even kings and queens, were therefore obliged todepend upon the professional story-teller.Fairy tales were very popular in the Middle Ages.  In the long wintermonths fields could not be cultivated, traveling had to be abandoned,and all were kept within doors by the cold and snow.  We know what theknight's house looked like in those days.  The large beamed hail orliving room was the principal room.  At one end of it, on a lowplatform, was a table for the knight, his family, and any visitingknights and ladies.  At the other tables on the main floor were thearmed men, like squires and retainers, who helped defend the castlefrom attack, and the maids of the household.The story-teller, who was sometimes called a bard or skald or minstrel,had his place of honor in the center of the room, and when the meal wasover he was called upon for a story.  These story-tellers became veryexpert in the practice of their art, and some of them could arousetheir audiences to a great pitch of excitement.  In the note thatprecedes the story "The Treason of Ganelon," in the volume "Heroes andHeroines of Chivalry," you can see how one of these story-tellers, orminstrels, sang aloud a story to the soldiers of William the Conquerorto encourage them as he led them into battle.The fairy tales collected by the Brothers Grimm were first published in1812.  They spent thirteen years collecting them, writing them down asthey were told by the peasants in Hesse, a mountainous province ofGermany lying far removed from the great main roads.Their friends helped them, but their best friend was the wife of acowherd, a strong, intelligent woman of fifty, who had a perfect geniusfor storytelling.  She knew she told the stories well, and that notmany had her gift.  The Grimms said that though she repeated a storyfor them three times, the variations were so slight as to be hardlyapparent.The American Indian stories of Manabozho the Mischief-Maker and hisadventures with the Wolf and the Woodpeckers and the Ducks werecollected in very much the same way by Henry R. Schoolcraft (1793-1864), the explorer and traveler, who lived among the Indian tribes forthirty years.Mrs. Steel has told us how she collected her Hindu stories, oftenlistening over and over to poor story-tellers who would spoil a storyin trying to tell it, until one day her patience would be rewarded byhearing it from the lips of the best storyteller in the village, whowas generally a boy.As all nations have their fairy tales, you will find in this collectionexamples of English, Irish, French, German, Scandinavian, Icelandic,Russian, Polish, Serbian, Spanish, Arabian, Hindu, Chinese, andJapanese fairy tales, as well as those recited around the lodge firesat night by American Indians for the entertainment of the red childrenof the West.I hope the work may prove for many a boy and girl (of any age up to ahundred) the Golden Bridge over which they can plunge into thatmarvelous world of fairies, elves, goblins, kobolds, trolls, afreets,jinns, ogres, and giants that fascinates us all, lost to this worldtill some one wakes us up to say "Bedtime!"Such excursions fill the mind with beautiful fancies and help todevelop that most precious of our faculties, the imagination.WILLIAM PATTEN.MANABOZHO, THE MISCHIEF-MAKERAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftTHERE was never in the whole world a more mischievous busybody thanthat notorious giant Manabozho.  He was everywhere, in season and outof season, running about, and putting his hand in whatever was goingforward.To carry on his game he could take almost any shape he pleased.  Hecould be very foolish or very wise, very weak or very strong, very richor very poor-just as happened to suit his humor best.  Whatever anyoneelse could do, he would attempt without a moment's reflection.  He wasa match for any man he met, and there were few manitoes*  (*goodspirits or evil spirits) that could get the better of him.  By turns hewould be very kind or very cruel, an animal or a bird, a man or aspirit, and yet, in spite of all these gifts, Manabozho was alwaysgetting himself involved in all sorts of troubles.  More than once, inthe course of his adventures, was this great maker of mischief drivento his wits' ends to come off with his life.To begin at the beginning, Manabozho, while yet a youngster, was livingwith his grandmother near the edge of a great prairie.  It was on thisprairie that he first saw animals and birds of every kind; he alsothere made first acquaintance with thunder and lightning.  He would sitby the hour watching the clouds as they rolled by, musing on the shadesof light and darkness as the day rose and fell.For a stripling, Manabozho was uncommonly wide-awake.  Every sight hebeheld in the heavens was a subject of remark, every new animal or birdan object of deep interest, and every sound was like a new lesson whichhe was expected to learn.  He often trembled at what he heard and saw.The first sound he heard was that of the owl, at which he was greatlyterrified, and, quickly descending the tree he had climbed, he ran withalarm to the lodge.  "Noko! noko! grandmother!" he cried.  "I haveheard a monedo."She laughed at his fears, and asked him what kind of a noise it made.He answered.  "It makes a noise like this: ko-ko-ko-ho!"His grandmother told him he was young and foolish; that what he heardwas only a bird which derived its name from the peculiar noise it made.He returned to the prairie and continued his watch.  As he stood therelooking at the clouds he thought to himself, "It is singular that I amso simple and my grandmother so wise; and that I have neither fathernor mother.  I have never heard a word about them.  I must ask and findout."He went home and sat down, silent and dejected.  Finding that this didnot attract the notice of his grandmother, he began a loud lamentation,which he kept increasing, louder and louder, till it shook the lodgeand nearly deafened the old grandmother."Manabozho, what is the matter with you?" she said, "you are making agreat deal of noise."Manabozho started off again with his doleful hubbub, but succeeded injerking out between his big sobs, "I haven't got any father nor mother,I haven't."Knowing that he was of a wicked and revengeful nature, his grandmotherdreaded to tell him the story of his parentage, as she knew he wouldmake trouble of it.Manabozho renewed his cries and managed to throw out for a third orfourth time, his sorrowful lament that he was a poor unfortunate whohad no parents or relatives.At last she said to him, to quiet him, "Yes, you have a father andthree brothers living.  Your mother is dead.  She was taken for a wifeby your father, the West, without the consent of her parents.  Yourbrothers are the North, East, and South; and being older than you yourfather has given them great power with the winds, according to theirnames.  You are the youngest of his children.  I have nursed you fromyour infancy, for your mother died when you were born.""I am glad my father is living," said Manabozho, "I shall set out inthe morning to visit him."His grandmother would have discouraged him, saying it was a longdistance to the place where his father, Ningabinn, or the West, lived.This information seemed rather to please than to discourage Manabozho,for by this time he had grown to such a size and strength that he hadbeen compelled to leave the narrow shelter of his grandmother's lodgeand live out of doors.  He was so tall that, if he had been sodisposed, he could have snapped off the heads of the birds roosting onthe topmost branches of the highest trees, as he stood up, withoutbeing at the trouble to climb.  And if he had at any time taken a fancyto one of the same trees for a walking stick, he would have had no moreto do than to pluck it up with his thumb and finger and strip down theleaves and twigs with the palm of his hand.Bidding good-by to his old grandmother, who pulled a very long faceover his departure, Manabozho set out at a great pace, for he was ableto stride from one side of a prairie to the other at a single step.He found his father on a high mountain far in the west.  His fatherespied his approach at a great distance, and bounded down themountainside several miles to give him welcome.  Apparently delightedwith each other, they reached in two or three of their giant paces thelodge of the West which stood high up near the clouds.They spent some days in talking with each other-for these two greatpersons did nothing on a small scale, and a whole day to deliver asingle sentence, such was the immensity of their discourse, was quitean ordinary affair.One evening Manabozho asked his father what he was most afraid of onearth.He replied-"Nothing.""But is there nothing you dread here-nothing that would hurt you if youtook too much of it?  Come, tell me."Manabozho was very urgent, so at last his father said: "Yes, there is ablack stone to be found a couple of hundred miles from here, over thatway," pointing as he spoke.  "It is the only thing on earth I am afraidof, for if it should happen to hit me on any part of my body it wouldhurt me very much."  The West made this important circumstance known toManabozho in the strictest confidence."Now you will not tell anyone, Manabozho, that the black stone is badmedicine for your father, will you?"  he added.  "You are a good son,and I know you will keep it to yourself.  Now tell me, my darling boy,is there not something that you don't like?"Manabozho answered promptly-"Nothing."His father, who was of a steady and persevering nature, put the samequestion to him seventeen times, and each time Manabozho made the sameanswer-' 'Nothing."But the West insisted-"There must be something you are afraid of.""Well, I will tell you," said Manabozho, "what it is."He made an effort to speak, but it seemed to be too much for him."Out with it," said the West, fetching Manabozho such a blow on theback as shook the mountain with its echo."Je-ee, je-ee-it is," said Manabozho, apparently in great pain.  "Yes,yes!  I cannot name it, I tremble so."The West told him to banish his fears, and to speak up; no one wouldhurt him.  Manabozho began again, and he would have gone over the samemake-believe of pain, had not his father, whose strength he knew wasmore than a match for his own, threatened to pitch him into a riverabout five miles off.  At last he cried out:"Father, since you will know, it is the root of the bulrush."  He whocould with perfect ease spin a sentence a whole day long, seemed to beexhausted by the effort of pronouncing that one word, "bulrush."Some time after Manabozho observed: "I will get some of the black rock,merely to see how it looks.""Well," said the father, "I will also get a little of the bulrush root,to learn how it tastes."They were both double-dealing with each other, and in their heartsgetting ready for some desperate work.  They had no sooner separatedfor the evening than Manabozho was striding off the couple of hundredmiles necessary to bring him to the place where the black rock was tobe procured, while down the other side of the mountain hurriedNingabinn, the West.At the break of day they each appeared at the great level on themountain-top, Manabozho with twenty loads, at least, of the blackstone, on one side, and on the other the West, with a whole meadow ofbulrush in his arms.Manabozho was the first to strike-hurling a great piece of the blackrock, which struck the West directly between the eyes, and he returnedthe favor with a blow of bulrush that rung over the shoulders ofManabozho, far and wide, like the long lash of the lightning among theclouds.First one and then the other, Manabozho poured in a tempest of blackrock, while the West discharged a shower of bulrush.  Blow upon blow,thwack upon thwack-they fought hand to hand until black rock andbulrush were all gone.  Then they betook themselves to hurling crags ateach other, cudgeling with huge oak trees, and defying each other fromone mountain top to another; while at times they shot enormous bouldersof granite across at each other's heads, as though they had been merejackstones.  The battle, which had commenced on the mountains, hadextended far west.  The West was forced to give ground.  Manabozhopressing on, drove him across rivers and mountains, ridges and lakes,till at last he got him to the very brink of the world."Hold!" cried the West.  "My son, you know my power, and although Iallow I am now fairly out of breath, it is impossible to kill me.  Stopwhere you are, and I will also portion you out with as much power asyour brothers.  The four quarters of the globe are already occupied,but you can go and do a great deal of good to the people of the earth,which is beset with serpents, beasts and monsters, who make great havocof human life.  Go and do good, and if you put forth half the strengthyou have to-day, you will acquire a name that will last forever.  Whenyou have finished your work I will have a place provided for you.  Youwill then go and sit with your brother, Kabinocca, in the north."Manabozho gave his father his hand upon this agreement.  And partingfrom.  him, he returned to his own grounds, where he lay for some timesore of his wounds.WHY THE WOODPECKER HAS RED HEAD FEATHERSAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftWHEN his wounds had all been cured by his grandmother's skill inmedicine, Manabozho, as big and sturdy as ever, was ripe for newadventures.  He set his thoughts immediately upon a war excursionagainst the Pearl Feather, a wicked old manito, living on the otherside of the great lake, who had killed his grandfather.He began his preparations by making huge bows and arrows withoutnumber, but he had no arrow heads.  At last his grandmother, Noko, toldhim that an old man who lived at some distance could furnish him withsome, and he sent her to get them.  Though she returned with herwrapper full, he told her that he had not enough and sent her again formore.In the meanwhile he thought to himself, "I must find out the way ofmaking these heads."Instead of directly asking how it was done, he preferred-just likeManabozho-to deceive his grandmother, in order to learn what he wantedby a trick.  "Noko," said he, "while I take my drum and rattle, andsing my war songs, do you go and try to get me some larger heads, forthese you have brought me are all of the same size.  Go and see whetherthe old man is not willing to make some a little larger."He followed her at a distance as she went, having left his drum at thelodge, with a great bird tied at the top, whose fluttering wings shouldkeep up the drumbeat, the same as if he were standing there beating thedrum himself.  He saw the old workman busy, and learned how he preparedthe heads; he also beheld the old man's daughter, who was verybeautiful.  Manabozho discovered for the first time that he had a heartof his own, and the sigh he heaved passed through the arrow maker'slodge like a young gale of wind."My how it blows!" said the old man."It must be from the south, though," said the daughter, "it is sofragrant."Manabozho slipped away, and in two strides he was at home, shoutingforth his songs as though he had never left the lodge.  He had justtime to untie the bird which had been beating the drum when hisgrandmother came in and gave him the big arrowheads.In the evening the grandmother said, "My son, you ought to fast beforeyou go to war, as your brothers do, to find out whether you will besuccessful or not."He said he had no objection.  Having privately stored away in a shadyplace in the forest two or three dozen juicy bears, a moose, and twentystrings of the tenderest birds, he would retire from the lodge so faras to be entirely out of view of his grandmother and fall to and enjoyhimself heartily.  At nightfall, having dispatched a dozen birds andhalf a bear or so, he would return, tottering and forlorn, as if quitefamished, so as to make his grandmother feel sorry for him.When he had finished his term of fasting, in the course of which heslyly dispatched twenty fat bears, six dozen birds, and two fine moose,Manabozho sung his war song and embarked in his canoe, fully preparedfor war.Besides his weapons he took along a large supply of oil.He traveled rapidly night and day, for he had only to will or speak,and the canoe went.  At length he arrived in sight of the fieryserpents, and stopped to study them.  He noticed that they were ofenormous length and of a bright color, that they were some distanceapart, and that the flames which poured forth from the mouths reachedacross the pass, so he said good morning and began talking with them ina very friendly way.  They were not to be deceived, however."We know you, Manabozho," they said, "you cannot pass."Turning his canoe as if about to go back, he suddenly cried out with aloud and terrified voice:  "WHAT IS THAT BEHIND YOU?"The serpents thrown off their guard, instantly turned their heads, andin a moment Manabozho glided silently past them."Well," said he, softly, after he had got by, "how about it?"He then took up his bow and arrows, and with deliberate aim shot everyone of them easily, for the serpents were fixed to one spot and couldnot even turn around.Having thus escaped the sentinel serpents, Manabozho pushed on in hiscanoe until he came to a part of the lake called Pitch-Water, aswhatever touched it was sure to stick fast.But Manabozho was prepared with his oil and, rubbing his canoe freelywith it, from end to end, he slipped through with ease-and he was thefirst person who had ever succeeded in passing through the Pitch-Water."Nothing like a little oil," said Manabozho to himself.Having by this time come in view of land, he could see the lodge of theShining Manito, high upon a distant hill.  At the dawn of day he puthis clubs and arrows in order and began his attack, yelling andshouting and beating his drum, and calling out so as to make it appearthat he had many followers:"Surround him! surround him! run up! run up!"He stalked bravely forward, shouting aloud, "It was you that killed mygrandfather," and shot off a whole forest of arrows.The Pearl Feather appeared on the height, blazing like the sun, andpaid back Manabozho with a tempest of bolts which rattled like hail.All day long the fight was kept up, and Manabozho had fired all of hisarrows but three without effect, for the Shining Manito was clothed inpure wampum.  It was only by immense leaps to right and left thatManabozho could save his head from the sturdy blows which fell abouthim on every side, like pine.trees, from the hands of the Manito.  Hewas badly bruised, and at his very wits' end, when a large Woodpeckerflew past and lit on a tree.  It was a bird he had known on theprairie, near his grandmother's lodge."Manabozho," called out the Woodpecker, "your enemy has a weak point;shoot at the lock of hair on the crown of his head."The first arrow he shot only drew a few drops of blood.  The Manitomade one or two unsteady steps, but recovered himself.  He began toparley, but Manabozho, now that he had discovered a way to reach him,was in no humor to trifle, and he let slip another arrow which broughtthe Shining Manito to his knees.  Having the crown of his head withingood range Manabozho shot his third arrow, and the Manito fell forwardupon the ground, dead.Manabozho called the Woodpecker to come and receive a reward for thetimely hint he had given him, and he rubbed the blood of the ShiningManito on the Woodpecker's head, the feathers of which are red to thisday.Full of his victory, Manabozho returned home, beating his war drumfuriously and shouting aloud his song of triumph.  His grandmother wason the shore to welcome him with the war dance, which she performedwith wonderful skill for one so far advanced in years.WHY THE DIVER DUCK HAS SO FEW TAIL FEATHERSAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftHAVING overcome the powerful Pearl Feather, killed his serpents andescaped all is wiles and charms, the heart of Manabozho welled withinhim.  An unconquerable desire for further adventures seized upon him.He had won in a great fight on land, so he determined -his next successshould come to him from the water.He tried his luck as a fisherman and with such success that he capturedan enormous fish, a fish so -rich in fat that with the oil Manabozhowas able to -form a small lake.  Wishing to be generous, and at thesame time having a cunning plan of his own, he invited all the birdsand beasts of his acquaintance to come and feast upon the oil, tellingthem that the order in which they partook of the banquet -would decidehow fat each was to be for all time to -come.As fast as they arrived he told them to plunge in and help themselves.The first to make his appearance was the bear, -who took a long andsteady draft; then came the deer, the opossum, and such others of thefamily as are noted for their comfortable covering.  The moose and thebuffalo were late in arriving on the scene, and the partridge, alwayslean in flesh, looked on till the supply was nearly gone.  There wasnot -a drop left by the time the hare and the marten appeared on theshore of the lake, and they are, in consequence, the slenderest of allcreatures.When this ceremony was over Manabozho suggested to his friends, theassembled birds and animals, that the occasion was proper for a littlemerrymaking; and taking up his drum he cried out:"New songs from the South! Come, brothers, dance!"They all fell in and commenced their rounds.  Whenever Manabozho, as hestood in the circle, saw a fat fowl which he fancied pass him, headroitly wrung its neck and slipped it under his belt, at the same timebeating his drum and singing at the top of his lungs to drown the noiseof the fluttering, crying out in a tone of admiration:"That's the way, my brothers; that's the way."  At last a small duck ofthe diver family, thinking there was something wrong, opened one eyeand saw what Manabozho was doing.  Giving a spring, and crying: "Ha-ha-a! Manabozho is killing us!" he made a dash for the water.Manabozho was so angry that the creature should have played the spythat he gave chase, and just as the Diver Duck was getting into thewater he gave him a kick, which is the reason that the diver's tailfeathers are few, his back flattened, and his legs straightened out, sothat when he is seen walking on land he makes a sorry looking figure.The other birds, having no ambition to be thrust in Manabozho's belt,flew off, and the animals scampered into the woods.MANAIBOZHO IS CHANGED INTO AWOLFAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftONE evening, as Manabozho was walking along the shore of a great lake,weary and hungry, he met a great magician in the form of an Old Wolf,with six young ones, coming toward him.The Wolf no Sooner caught sight of him than he told his whelps, whowere close beside him, to keep out of the way of Manabozho, "For Iknow," he said, "that it is that mischievous fellow whom we seeyonder."The young wolves were in the act of running off when Manabozho criedout, "My grandchildren, where are you going?  Stop and I will go withyou.  I wish to have a little chat with your excellent father."Saying which, he advanced and greeted the Old Wolf, expressing himselfas delighted at seeing him looking so well.  "Whither do you journey?"he asked."We are looking for a good hunting-ground to pass the winter," the OldWolf answered.  "What brings you here?"'I was looking for you," said Manabozho.  "For I have a passion for thechase, brother.  I always admired your family; are you willing tochange me into a wolf?"The Wolf gave him a favorable answer, and he was forthwith changed intoa wolf."Well, that will do," said Manabozho.  "But," he said, looking at histail, "could you oblige me by making my tail a little longer and morebushy, just a little more bushy?""Certainly," said the Old Wolf; and he straightway gave Manabozho sucha length and spread of tail that it was continually getting between hislegs, and it was so heavy that it was as much as he could do to carryit.  But, having asked for it, he was ashamed to say a word, and theyall started off in company, dashing up the ravine.After getting into the woods for some distance they ran across thetracks of moose.  The young ones scampered off in pursuit, the Old Wolfand Manabozho following at their leisure."Well," said the Old Wolf, by way of starting the conversation, "who doyou think is the fastest of the boys?  Can you tell by the jumps theytake?""Why," he replied, "that one that takes such 'long jumps, he is surelythe fastest.""Ha! ha! you are mistaken," said the Old Wolf.  "He makes a good start,but he will be the first to tire out; this one who appears to be behindwill be the one to kill the game."By this time they had come to the spot where the boys had started inchase.  One had dropped what seemed to be a small medicine-sack, whichhe carried for the use of the hunting party."Take that, Manabozho," said the Old Wolf."Why, what will I do with a dirty dog skin?"The Old Wolf took it up; it was a beautiful robe."Oh, I will carry it now," cried Manabozho."Oh, no," said the Wolf, who had used his magical powers, "it is a robeof pearls.  Come along!" And away he sped at a great rate of speed."Not so fast," called Manabozho after him; and then he added to himselfas he panted after, "Oh, this tail!"Coming to a place where the moose had lain down, they saw that theyoung wolves had made a fresh start after their prey.  "'Why," said theOld Wolf, "this moose is thin.  I know by the tracks.  I can alwaystell whether they are fat or not."  A little farther on, one of theyoung wolves, in dashing at the moose, had broken a tooth on a tree."Manabozho," said the Old Wolf, "one of your grandchildren has shot atthe game.  Take his arrow; there it is.""No," replied Manabozho, "what will I do with a dirty dog's tooth?"The Old Wolf took it up, and behold it was a beautiful silver arrow.When they at last overtook them, they found that the youngsters hadkilled a very fat moose.  Manabozho was very hungry, but the Old Wolfjust then again exerted his magical powers, and Manabozho saw nothingbut the bones picked quite clean.  He thought to himself, "Just as Iexpected; dirty, greedy fellows.  If it had not been for this log at myback I should have been in time to have got a mouthful"; and he cursedthe bushy tail which he carried to the bottom of his heart.The Old Wolf finally called out to one of the young ones, "Give somemeat to your grandfather."One of them obeyed, and coming near to Manabozho he presented him theend of his own bushy tail, which was now nicely seasoned with bursgathered in the course of the hunt.  Manabozho jumped up and calledout: "You dog, do you think I am going to eat you?" And he walked offin anger."Come back brother," cried the Wolf.  "You are losing your eyes.  Youdo the child injustice.  Look there I" and behold a heap of fresh meatwas lying on the spot, all prepared.Manabozho turned back, and at the sight of so much good food put on asmiling face.  "Wonderful!" he said, "how fine the meat is !""Yes," replied the Old Wolf, "it is always so with us; we know our workand always get the best.  It is not a long tail that makes the hunter."Manabozho bit his lip.MANABOZHO IS ROBBED BY THE WOLVESAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftSHORTLY after this the Old Wolf suggested to Manabozho that he shouldgo out and try his luck in hunting by himself.  When he chose to puthis mind to it he was quite expert, and this time he succeeded inkilling a fine fat moose which he thought he would take aside slyly anddevour alone.He was very hungry and he sat down to eat, but as he never could go towork in a straightforward way, he immediately fell into great doubts asto the proper point at which to begin."Well," said he, "I do not know where to commence.  At the head?  No,people will laugh, and say, 'He ate him backward.'"He went to the side.  "No," said he, "they will say I ate himsideways."He then went to the hind quarter.  "No, that will not do, either; theywill say I ate him forward.  I will begin here, say what they will."He took a delicate piece from the small of the back, and was just onthe point of putting it to his mouth when a tree close by made acreaking noise.  He seemed vexed at the sound.  He raised the morsel tohis mouth the second time, when the tree creaked again."Why," he exclaimed, "I cannot eat when I hear such a noise. "Stop,stop! " he cried to the tree.  He put down the morsel of meat,exclaiming.  "I CANNOT eat with such a noise," and starting away heclimbed the tree and was actually pulling at the limb which hadbothered him, when his forepaw was caught between the branches so thathe could not free himself.While thus held fast he saw a pack of wolves advancing through the woodin the direction of his meat.  He suspected them to be the Old Wolf andhis cubs, but night was coming on and he could not make them out.  "Gothe other way, go the other Way!" he cried out; "what do you expect toget here?"The Wolves stopped for a while and talked among themselves, and said:"Manabozho must have something there, or he would not tell us to goanother way. ""I begin to know know him," said the Old Wolf, "and all his tricks.Let us go forward and see." They came on and, finding the moose soonmade away with it.Manabozho looked wistfully on while they ate until they were fullysatisfied, when off they scampered in high spirits.  A heavy blast ofwind opened the branches finally, and released him.  The wolves hadleft nothing but bare bones.  He made for home.When he related his mishap, the Old Wolf, taking him by the forepaw,condoled with him deeply on his ill luck.  A tear even started to hiseye as he added: "My brother, this should teach us not to meddle withpoints of ceremony when we have good meat to eat."MANABOZHO AND THE WOODPECKERSAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftMANABOZHO lost the greater part of his magical power through lettinghis young wolf grandson fall through the thin ice and drown.  No oneknew where his grandmother had gone to.  He married the arrow maker'sdaughter, and became the father of several children, but he was verypoor and scarcely able to procure a living.  His lodge was pitched in adistant part of the country, where he could get no game, and it waswinter time.  One day he said to his wife, "I will go out walking andsee if I can find some lodges."After walking some time he finally discovered a lodge at a distance.There were children playing at the door, and when they saw himapproaching they ran in and told their parents Manabozho was coming.It was the home of the large Red-Headed Woodpecker.  He came to thedoor and asked Manabozho to enter, and the invitation was promptlyaccepted.  After some time the Woodpecker, who was a magician, said tohis wife: "Have you nothing to give Manabozho?  he must be hungry."She answered, "No.""He ought not to go without his supper," said the Woodpecker.  "I willsee what I can do."In the center of the lodge stood a large tamarack tree.  Upon this theWoodpecker flew, and commenced going up, turning his head on each sideof the tree, and every now and then driving in his bill.  At last hepulled something out of the tree and threw it down, when, behold, afine fat raccoon lay on the ground.  He drew out six or seven more, andthen came down and told his wife to prepare them."Manabozho," he said, "this is the only thing we eat; what else can wegive you?""It is very good," replied Manabozho.They smoked their pipes and conversed, and after a while Manabozho gotready to go home, so the Woodpecker said to his wife, "Give him theOther raccoons to take home for his children."In the act of leaving the lodge Manabozho on purpose dropped one of hismittens, which was soon after observed upon the ground.  "Run," saidthe Woodpecker to his eldest son, "and give it to him; but mind thatyou do not give it into his hand; throw it at him, for there is noknowing what he may do, he acts so curiously."The boy did as he was directed.  "Grandfather," he said, as he came upto him, "you have left one of your mittens, and here it is.""Yes," he said, making believe he did not know he had dropped it, "so Idid; but don't throw it, you will get it wet on the snow."The lad, however, threw it, and was about to return when Manabozhocried out, "Bakah! Bakah! Stop, stop; is that all you eat?  Do you eatnothing else with your raccoon?  Tell me!""Yes, that is all, answered the Young Woodpecker; "we have nothingelse.""Tell your father," continued Manabozho, "to come and visit me, and lethim bring a sack.  I will give him what he shall eat with his raccoonmeat."When the young one returned and reported this message to his father theOld Woodpecker turned up his nose at the invitation.  "I wonder," hesaid "what he thinks he has got, poor fellow!" He was bound, however,to answer the offer of hospitality, and he went accordingly, takingalong a cedar-sack, to pay a visit to Manabozho.Manabozho received the Old Red-Headed Woodpecker with great ceremony.He had stood at the door awaiting his arrival, and as soon as he camein sight Manabozho commenced, while he was yet far off, bowing andopening wide his arms, in token of welcome; all of which the Woodpeckerreturned in due form, by ducking his bill and hopping to right andleft, extending his wings to their full length and fluttering them backto his breast.When the Woodpecker at last reached the lodge Manabozho made severalremarks upon the weather, the appearance of the country, and especiallyspoke of the scarcity of game.  "But we," he added-"we always haveenough.  Come in, and you shall not go away hungry, my noble birds!"Manabozho had always prided himself on being able to give as good as hehad received; and to be up with the Woodpecker he had shifted his lodgeso as to inclose a large dry tamarack tree."What can I give you?" said he to the Woodpecker; "as we eat so shallyou eat."With this he hopped forward and, jumping on the tamarack tree, heattempted to climb it just as he had seen the Woodpecker do in his ownlodge.  He turned his head first on one side and then on the other, asthe Woodpecker does, striving to go up the tree, but as often slippingdown.  Every now and then he would strike the tree with his nose, as ifit was a bell, and draw back as if to pull something out of the tree,but he pulled out no raccoons.  He dashed his nose so often against thetrunk that at last the blood began to flow, and he tumbled downsenseless on the ground.The Woodpecker started up with his drum and rattle to restore him, andby beating them violently he succeeded in bringing him to.As soon as he came to his senses, Manabozho began to lay the blame ofhis failure upon his wife, saying to his guest: "Nemesho, it is thiswoman relation of yours-she is the cause of my not succeeding.  She hasmade me a worthless fellow.  Before I married her I also could getraccoons.The Woodpecker said nothing, but flying on the tree he drew out severalfine raccoons.  "Here," said he, "this is the way we do" and left himin disdain, carrying his bill high in the air, and stepping over thedoorsill as if it were not worthy to be touched by his toes.THE BOY AND THE WOLVESRetold by Andrew LangONCE upon a time an Indian hunter built himself a house in the middleof a great forest, far away from all his tribe; for his heart wasgentle and kind and he was weary of the treachery and cruel deeds ofthose who had been his friends.  So he left them and took his wife andthree children, and they journeyed on until they found a spot near to aclear stream, where they began to cut down trees and to make readytheir wigwam.  For many years they lived peacefully and happily in thissheltered place, never leaving it except to hunt the wild animals,which served them both for food and clothes.  At last, however, thestrong man fell sick, and before long lie knew he must die.  So hegathered his family round him and said his last words to them."You, my wife, the companion of my days, will follow me ere many moonshave waned to the island of the blessed.  But for you, 0 my children,whose lives are but newly begun, the wickedness, unkindness, andingratitude from which I fled are before you.  Yet I shall go hence inpeace, my children, if you will promise always to love each other andnever to forsake your youngest brother.""Never!" they replied, holding out their hands.  And the hunter diedcontent.Scarcely eight moons had passed when, just as he had said, the wifewent forth and followed her husband; but before leaving her childrenshe bade the two elder ones think of their promise never to forsake theyounger, for he was a child and weak.  And while the snow lay thickupon the ground they tended him and cherished him; but when the earthshowed green again the heart of the young man stirred within him, andhe longed to see the wigwams of the village where his father's youthwas spent.Therefore he opened all his heart to his sister, who answered: "Mybrother, I understand your longing for our fellow-men, whom here wecannot see.  But remember our father's words.  Shall we not seek ourown pleasures and forget the little one?"But he would not listen, and, making no reply, he took his bow andarrows and left the hut.  The snows fell and melted, yet he neverreturned, and at last the heart of the girl grew cold and hard and herlittle boy became a burden in her eyes, till one day she spoke thus tohim: "See, there is food for many days to come.  Stay here within theshelter of the hut.  I go to seek our brother, and when I have foundhim I shall return hither."But when, after hard journeying, she reached the village where herbrother dwelt and saw that he had a wife and was happy, and when she,too, was sought by a young brave, then she also forgot the boy alone inthe forest and thought only of her husband.Now as soon as the little boy had eaten all the food which his sisterhad left him, he went out into the woods and gathered berries and dugup roots, and while the sun shone he was contented and had his fill.But when the snows began and the wind howled, then his stomach feltempty and his limbs cold, and he hid in trees all the night and onlycrept out to eat what the wolves had left behind.  And by and by,having no other friends, he sought their company, and sat by while theydevoured their prey, and they grew to know him and gave him food.  Andwithout them he would have died in the snow.  But at last the snowsmelted and the ice upon the great lake, and as the wolves went down tothe shore the boy went after them.  And it happened one day that hisbig brother was fishing in his canoe near the shore, and he heard thevoice of a child singing in the Indian tone:	"My brother, my brother!	I am becoming a wolf,	I am becoming a wolf!"And when he had so sung he howled as wolves howl.  Then the heart ofthe elder sank and he hastened toward him, crying: "Brother, littlebrother, come to me;" but he, being half a wolf, only continued hissong.  And the louder the elder called him, "Brother, little brother,come to me," the swifter he fled after his brothers the wolves and theheavier grew his skin, till, with a long howl, he vanished into thedepths of the forest.So, with shame and anguish in his soul, the elder brother went back tohis village, and with his sister mourned the little boy and the brokenpromise till the end of his life.THE INDIAN WHO LOST HIS WIFERetold by Andrew LangONCE upon a time there was a man and his wife who lived in the forestfar from the rest of the tribe.  Very often they spent the day inhunting together, but after awhile the wife found that she had so manythings to do that she was obliged to stay at home; so he went alone,though he found that when his wife was not with him he never had anyluck.  One day, when he was away hunting, the woman fell ill, and in afew days she died.  Her husband grieved bitterly and buried her in thehouse where she had passed her life; but as the time went on he felt solonely without her that he made a wooden doll about her height amidsize for company and dressed it in her clothes.  He seated it in frontof the fire and tried to think he had his wife back again.  The nextday he went out to hunt, and when he came home the first thing he didwas to go up to the doll and brush off some of the ashes from the firewhich had fallen on its face.  But he was very busy now, for he had tocook and mend, besides getting food, for there was no one to help him.And so a whole year passed away.At the end of that time he came back from hunting one night and foundsome wood by the door and a fire within.  The next night there was notonly wood and fire, but a piece of meat in the kettle, nearly ready foreating.  He searched all about to see who could have done this, butcould find no one.  The next time he went to hunt he took care not togo far and came in quite early.  And while he was still a long way offhe saw a woman going into the house with wood on her shoulders.  So hemade haste and opened the door quickly, and instead of the wooden dollhis wife sat in front of the fire.  Then she spoke to him and said:"The Great Spirit felt sorry for you because you would not becomforted, so he let me come back to you, but you must not stretch outyour hand to touch me till we have seen the rest of our people.  If youdo I shall die."So the man listened to her words, and the woman dwelt there and broughtthe wood and kindled the fire, till one day her husband said to her:"It is now two years since you died.  Let us now go back to our tribe.Then you will be well and I can touch you."And with that he prepared food for the journey, a string of deer'sflesh for her to carry and one for himself; and so they started.  Now,the camp of the tribe was distant six days' journey, and when they wereyet one day's journey off it began to snow, and they felt weary andlonged for rest.  Therefore they made a fire, cooked some food, andspread out their skins to sleep.Then the heart of the man was greatly stirred and he stretched out hisarms to his wife, but she waved her hands and said:"We have seen no one yet.  It is too soon."But he would not listen to her and caught her to him, and behold! hewas clasping the wooden doll.  And when he saw it was the doll hepushed it from him in his misery and rushed away to the camp and toldthem all his story.  And some doubted, and they went back with him tothe place where he and his wife had stopped to rest, and there lay thedoll, and besides, they saw in time snow the steps of two people, andthe foot of one was like the foot of the doll.  And the man grievedsore all the days of his life.PUNCHKINBy E. FrereONCE upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was moreclever than the rest.  The Raja's wife died when they were quite littlechildren, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother totake care of them.The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinnerevery day, while he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on theaffairs of the nation.About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; andevery day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their father'sdinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg for alittle fire from the hearth.  Then Balna used to say to her sisters,"Send that woman away; send her away.  Let her get the fire at her ownhouse.  What does she want with ours?  If we allow her to come here, weshall suffer for it some day."But the other sisters would answer, "Be quiet, Balna; why must youalways be quarreling with this poor woman?  Let her take some fire ifshe likes."  Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and takea few sticks from it; and while no one was looking, she would quicklythrow some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being preparedfor the Raja's dinner.Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters.  Ever since their mother'sdeath they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order toavoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies.  So, when hefound the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise fromtheir carelessness, as it did not seem likely that anyone should haveput mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like toreprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeatedmany days.At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughterscooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room,and watched them through a hole in the wall.There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice andpreparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by thefire ready to be cooked.  Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come tothe door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinnerwith.  Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, "Why don't you keep fuelin your own house, and not come here every day and take ours?  Sisters,don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself."Then the eldest sister answered, "Balna, let the poor woman take thewood and the fire; she does us no harm."  But Balna replied, "If youlet her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make ussorry for it, some day."The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all hisdinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw alittle mud into each of the dishes.At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized andbrought before him.  But when the widow came, she told him that she hadplayed this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; andshe spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words,that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her hisRanee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace.Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to getthem, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter mighthave all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in theirplace; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her,she did all she could to make them miserable.  She gave them nothingbut bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water todrink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomedto have everything comfortable about them, and good food and goodclothes all their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and theyused to go out every day and sit by their dead mother's tomb and cry-and say:"O mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy weare, and how we are starved by our cruel stepmother?"One day, while they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! abeautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh,ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating someof the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat thebad dinner their stepmother provided for them, they used to go out totheir mother's grave and eat the pommels which grew there on thebeautiful tree.Then the Ranee said to her daughter, "I cannot tell how it is, everyday those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eatany; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better thanyou do.  I cannot tell how it is."   And she bade her watch the sevenPrincesses, and see if anyone gave them anything to eat.So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and wereeating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them,and saw them gathering the fruit.Then Balna said to her sisters, "Do you not see that girl watching us?Let us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tellher mother all about it, and that will be bad for us."But the other sisters said, "Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna.  The girlwould never be so cruel as to tell her mother.  Let us rather inviteher to come and have some of the fruit."  And calling her to them, theygave her one of the pomeloes.No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan's daughter wenthome and said to her mother, "I do not wonder the seven Princesses willnot eat the dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother's gravethere grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day andeat the pomeloes.  I ate one, and it was the nicest I have evertasted."The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day shestayed in her room, and told the Raja that she had a very bad headache.The Raja was deeply grieved, and said to his wife, "What can I do foryou?"   She answered, "There is only one thing that will make myheadache well.  By your dead wife's tomb there grows a fine pomelotree; you must bring that here, and boil it, root and branch, and put alittle of the water in which it has been boiled on my forehead, andthat will cure my headache."   So the Raja sent his servants, and hadthe beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Raneedesired; and when some of the water, in which it had been boiled, wasput on her forehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quitewell.Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of theirmother, the pomelo tree had disappeared.  Then they all began to cryvery bitterly.Now there was by the Ranee's tomb a small tank, and as they were cryingthey saw the tank was filled with a rich cream-like substance, whichquickly hardened into a thick white cake.  At seeing this all thePrincesses were very glad, and they ate some of the cake, and liked it;and next day the same thing happened, and so it went on for many days.Every morning the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and foundthe little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like cake.  Then thecruel stepmother said to her daughter: "I cannot tell how it is, I havehad the pomelo tree which used to grow by the Ranee's grave destroyed,and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor look more sad, though theynever eat the dinner I give them.  I cannot tell how it is!"And her daughter said, "I will watch."Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who shouldcome by but their stepmother's daughter.  Balna saw her first, andsaid, "See, sisters, there comes that girl again.  Let us sit round theedge of the tank and not allow her to see it, for if we give her someof our cake, she will go and tell her mother; and that will be veryunfortunate for us."The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious, andinstead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan's daughter someof the cake, and she went home and told her mother all about it.The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedinglyangry, and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee's tomb, andfill the little tank with the ruins.  And not content with this, shenext day pretended to be very, very ill-in fact, at the point of death-and when the Raja was much grieved, and asked her whether it was in hispower to procure her any remedy, she said to him: "Only one thing cansave my life, but I know you will not do it."  He replied, "Yes,whatever it is, I will do it."  She then said, "To save my life, youmust kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of theirblood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their death willbe my life."  At these words the Raja was very sorrowful; but becausehe feared to break his word, he went out with a heavy heart to find hisdaughters.He found them crying by the ruins of their mother's grave.Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Raja spoke kindly to them,and told them to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made afire and cooked some rice, and gave it to them.  But in the afternoon,it being very hot, the seven Princesses all fell asleep, and when hesaw they were fast asleep, the Raja, their father, stole away and leftthem (for he feared his wife), saying to himself: "It is better my poordaughters should die here, than be killed by their stepmother."He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some of its blood on theforehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he hadreally killed the Princesses, and said she felt quite well.Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves allalone in the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to callout as loud as they could, in hopes of making their father hear; but hewas by that time far away, and would not have been able to hear themeven had their voices been as loud as thunder.It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a neighboringRaja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as they werereturning home, after the day's sport was over, the youngest Princesaid to his brothers: "Stop, I think I hear some one crying and callingout.  Do you not hear voices?  Let us go in the direction of the sound,and find out what it is."So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the placewhere the seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands.  At thesight of them the young Princes were very much astonished, and stillmore so on learning their story; and they settled that each should takeone of these poor forlorn ladies home with him, and marry her.So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him,and married her.And the second took the second; and third took the third; and thefourth took the fourth; and the fifth took the fifth; and the sixthtook the sixth; and the seventh, and the handsomest of all, took thebeautiful Balna.And when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicingthroughout the kingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes toseven such beautiful Princesses.About a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles andaunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathersand seven mothers.  None of the other Princes and Princesses had anychildren, so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was acknowledgedtheir heir by all the rest.They had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day theseventh Prince (Balna's husband) said he would go out hunting, and awayhe went; and they waited long for him, but he never came back.Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become ofhim; and they went away, but they also did not return.And the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they feared that theirkind husbands must have been killed.One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna was rocking herbaby's cradle, and while her sisters were working in the room below,there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress, who saidthat he was a Fakir, and came to beg.  The servant said to him, "Youcannot go into the palace-the Raja's sons have all gone away; we thinkthey must be dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by yourbegging."  But he said, "I am a holy man, you must let me in.  Then thestupid servants let him walk through the palace, but they did not knowthat this was no Fakir, but a wicked Magician named Punchkin.Punchkin Fakir wandered through the palace, and saw many beautifulthings there, till at last he reached the room where Balna sat singingbeside her little boy's cradle.  The Magician thought her morebeautiful than all the other beautiful things he had seen, insomuchthat he asked her to go home with him and to marry him.  But she said,"My husband, I fear, is dead, but my little boy is still quite young; Iwill stay here and teach him to grow up a clever man, and when he isgrown up he shall go out into the world, and try and learn tidings ofhis father.  Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him, or marry yon."At these words the Magician was very angry, and turned her into alittle black dog, and led her away; saying, "Since yon will not comewith me of your own free will, I will make you."  So the poor Princesswas dragged away, without any power of effecting an escape, or ofletting her sisters know what had become of her.  As Punchkin passedthrough the palace gate the servants said to him, "Where did yon getthat pretty little dog?"  And he answered, "One of the Princesses gaveit to me as a present."  At hearing which they let him go withoutfurther questioning.Soon after this, the six elder Princesses heard the little baby, theirnephew, begin to cry, and when they went upstairs they were muchsurprised to find him all alone, and Balna nowhere to be seen.  Thenthey questioned the servants, and when they heard of the Fakir and thelittle black dog, they guessed what had happened, and sent in everydirection seeking them, but neither the Fakir nor the dog were to befound.  What could six poor women do?  They gave up all hopes of everseeing their kind husbands, and their sister, and her husband again,and devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care oftheir little nephew.Thus time went on, till Balna's son was fourteen years old.  Then, oneday, his aunts told him the history of the family; and no sooner did hehear it, than be was seized with a great desire to go in search of hisfather and mother and uncles, and if he could find them alive to bringthem home again.  His aunts, on learning his determination, were muchalarmed and tried to dissuade him, saying, "We have lost our husbands,and our sister and her husband, and you are now our sole hope; if yougo away, what shall we do?"  But he replied, "I pray you not to bediscouraged; I will return soon, and if it is possible bring my fatherand mother and uncles with me."  So he set out on his travels; but forsome months he could learn nothing to help him in his search.At last, after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles, andbecome almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his parents,he one day came to a country that seemed full of stones, and rocks, andtrees, and there he saw a large palace with a tower; hard by was aMalee's little house.As he was looking about, the Malee's wife saw him, and ran out of thehouse and said, "My dear boy, who are you that dare venture to thisdangerous place?"  He answered, "I am a Raja's son, and I come insearch of my father, and my uncles, and my mother whom a wickedenchanter bewitched."Then the Malee's wife said, "This country and this palace belong to agreat enchanter; he is all powerful, and if anyone displeases him, hecan turn them into stones and trees.  All the rocks and trees you seehere were living people once, and the Magician turned them to what theynow are.  Some time ago a Raja's son came here, and shortly afterwardcame his six brothers, and they were all turned into stones and trees;and these are not the only unfortunate ones, for up in that tower livesa beautiful Princess, whom the Magician has kept prisoner there fortwelve years, because she hates him and will not marry him."Then the little Prince thought, "These must be my parents and myuncles.  I have found what I seek at last."  So he told his story tothe Malee's wife, and begged her to help him to remain in that placeawhile and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she mentioned;and she promised to befriend him, and advised his disguising himselflest the Magician should see him, and turn him likewise into stone.  Tothis the Prince agreed.  So the Malee's wife dressed him up in a saree,and pretended that he was her daughter.One day, not long after this, as the Magician was walking in his gardenhe saw the little girl (as he thought) playing about, and asked her whoshe was.  She told him she was the Malee's daughter, and the Magiciansaid, "You are a pretty little girl, and to-morrow you shall take apresent of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in thetower."The young Prince was much delighted at hearing this, and wentimmediately to inform the Malee's wife; after consultation with whom hedetermined that it would be more safe for him to retain his disguise,and trust to the chance of a favorable opportunity for establishingsome communication with his mother, if it were indeed she.Now it happened that at Balna's marriage her husband had given her asmall gold ring on which her name was engraved, and she had put it onher little son's finger when he was a baby, and afterward when he wasolder his aunts had had it enlarged for him, so that he was still ableto wear it.  The Malee's wife advised him to fasten the well-knowntreasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother, and trustto her recognizing it.  This was not to be done without difficulty, assuch a strict watch was kept over the poor Princess (for fear of herever establishing communication with her friends), that though thesupposed Malee's daughter was permitted to take her flowers every day,the Magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the time.At last one day, however, opportunity favored him, and when no one waslooking the boy tied the ring to a nosegay, and threw it at Balna'sfeet.  It fell with a clang on the floor, and Balna, looking to seewhat made the strange sound, found the little ring tied to the flowers.On recognizing it, she at once believed the story her son told her ofhis long search, and begged him to advise her as to what she had betterdo; at the same time entreating him on no account to endanger his lifeby trying to rescue her.  She told him that for twelve long years theMagician had kept her shut up in the tower because she refused to marryhim, and she was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of release.Now Balna's son was a bright, clever boy, so he said, "Do not fear,dear mother; the first thing to do is to discover how far theMagician's power extends, in order that we may be able to liberate myfather and uncles, whom he has imprisoned in the form of the rocks andtrees.  You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years; nowrather speak kindly.  Tell him you have given up all hopes of againseeing the husband you have so long mourned, and say you are willing toharry him.  Then endeavor to find out what his power consists in, andwhether he is immortal, or can be put to death."Balna determined to take her son's advice; and the next day sent forPunchkin, and spoke to him as had been suggested.The Magician greatly delighted, begged her to allow the wedding to takeplace as soon as possible.But she told him that before she married him he must allow her a littlemore time, in which she might make his acquaintance, and that, afterbeing enemies so long, their friendship could but strengthen bydegrees.  "And do tell me," she said, "are you quite immortal?  Candeath never touch you?  And are you too great an enchanter ever to feelhuman suffering?""Why do you ask?" said he."Because," she replied.  "if I am to be your wife, I would fain knowall about you, in order, if any calamity threatens you, to overcome, orif possible to avert it.""It is true," he added, "that I am not as others.  Far, far away,hundreds of thousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate countrycovered with thick jungle.  In the midst of the jungle grows a circleof palm trees, and in the center of the circle stand six chattees fullof water, piled one above another: below the sixth chattee is a smallcage which contains a little green parrot; on the life of the parrotdepends my life; and if the parrot is killed I must die.  It is.however," he added, "impossible that the parrot should sustain anyinjury, both on account of the inaccessibility of the country, andbecause, by my appointment, many thousand genii surround the palmtrees, and kill all who approach the place."Balna told her son what Punchkin had said; but at the same timeimplored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot.The Prince, however, replied, "Mother, unless I can get hold of thatparrot, you, and my father, and uncles, cannot be liberated: be notafraid, I will shortly return.  Do you, meantime, keep the Magician ingood humor-still putting off your marriage with him on variouspretexts; and before he finds out the cause of delay, I will be here."So saying, he went away.Many, many weary miles did he travel, till at last he came to a thickjungle; and, being very tired, sat down under a tree and fell asleep.He was awakened by a soft rustling sound, and looking about him, saw alarge serpent which was making its way to an eagle's nest built in thetree under which he lay, and in the nest were two young eagles.  ThePrince seeing the danger of the young birds, drew his sword, and killedthe serpent; at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in the air,and the two old eagles, who had been out hunting for food for theiryoung ones, returned.  They quickly saw the dead serpent and the youngPrince standing over it; and the old mother eagle said to him, "Dearboy, for many' years all our young ones have been devoured by thatcruel serpent; you have now saved the lives of our children; wheneveryou are in need therefore, send to us and we will help you; and as forthese little eagles, take them, and let them be your servants."At this the Prince was very glad, and the two eaglets crossed theirwings, on which he mounted; and they carried him far, far away over thethick, jungles, until he came to the place where grew the circle ofpalm trees, in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of water.It was the middle of the day, and the heat was very great.  All roundthe trees were the genii fast asleep; nevertheless, there were suchcountless thousands of them, that it would have been quite impossiblefor anyone to walk through their ranks to the place; down swooped thestrong-winged eaglets-down jumped the Prince; in an instant he hadoverthrown the six chattees full of water, and seized the little greenparrot, which he rolled up in his cloak; while, as he mounted againinto the air, all the genii below awoke, and finding their treasuregone, set up a wild and melancholy howl.Away, away flew the little eagles, till they came to their home in thegreat tree; then the Prince said to the old eagles, "Take back yourlittle ones; they have done me good service; if ever again I stand inneed of help, I will not fail to come to you."  He then continued hisjourney on foot till he arrived once more at the Magician's palace,where he sat down at the door and began playing with the Parrot.Punchkin saw him, and came to him quickly, and said, "My boy, where didyon get that parrot?  Give it to me, I pray you."But the Prince answered, "Oh no, I cannot give away my parrot, it is agreat pet of mine; I have had it many years."Then the Magician said, "If it is an old favorite, I can understandyour not caring to give it away; but come, what will you sell it for?""Sir," said the Prince, "I will not sell my parrot."Then Punchkin got frightened, and said, "Anything, anything; name whatprice you will, and it shall be yours."  The Prince answered, "Let theseven Raja's sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantlyliberated.""It is done as you desire," said the Magician, "only give me myparrot."  And With that, by a stroke of his wand, Balna's husband andhis brothers resumed their natural shapes.  "Now, give me my parrot,"repeated Punchkin."Not so fast, my master," rejoined the Prince; "I must first beg thatyou will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned."The Magician immediately waved his wand again; and whilst he cried, inan imploring voice, "Give me my parrot!' the whole garden becamesuddenly alive: where rocks, and stones, and trees had been before,stood Rajas, and Punts, and Sirdars, and mighty men on prancing horses,and jeweled pages, and troops of armed attendants."Give me my parrot!" cried Punchkin.  Then the boy took hold of theparrot, and tore off one of its wings; and as he did so the Magician'sright arm fell off.Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, "Give me my parrot!"The Prince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the Magician's leftarm tumbled off."Give me my parrot!" cried he, and fell on his knees.  The Princepulled off the parrot's right leg, and the Magician's right leg felloff: the Prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell theMagician's left.Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but stillhe rolled his eyes, and cried "Give me my parrot!"  "Take your parrot,then, cried the boy, and with that.  he wrung the bird's neck, andthrew it at the magician; and as he did so, Punchkin's head twistedround and, with a fearful groan, he died!Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the sevenPrinces went to their own country, and lived very happily everafterward.  And as to the rest of the world, everyone went to his ownhouse.HOW SUN, MOON AND WIND WENT OUT TO DINNERBy E. FrereONE day Sun, Moon, and Wind went out to dine with their uncle and auntThunder and Lightning.  Their mother (one of the most distant Stars yousee far up in the sky) waited alone for her children's return.Now both Sun and Wind were greedy and selfish.  They enjoyed the greatfeast that had been prepared for them, without a thought of saving anyof it to take home to their mother-but the gentle Moon did not forgether.  Of every dainty dish that was brought round, she placed a smallportion under one of her beautiful long fingernails, that Star mightalso have a share in the treat.On their return, their mother, Who had kept watch for them all nightlong with her little bright eye, said, "Well, children, what have yonbrought home for me?"  Then Sun (who was eldest) said, "I have broughtnothing home for you.  I went out to enjoy myself with my friends-notto fetch dinner for my mother!"  And Wind said, "Neither have I broughtanything home for you, mother.  You could hardly expect me to bring acollection of good things for you, when I merely went out for my ownpleasure."  But Moon said, "Mother, fetch a plate, see what I havebrought you."  And shaking her hands she showered down such a choicedinner as never was seen before.Then Star turned to Sun and spoke thus, "Because you went out to amuseyourself with your friends, and feasted and enjoyed yourself, withoutany thought of our mother at home-you shall be cursed.  Henceforth,your rays shall ever be hot and scorching, and shall burn all that theytouch.  And men shall hate you, and cover their heads when you appear.(And that is why the Sun is so hot to this day.)Then she turned to Wind and said, "You also who forgot your mother inthe midst of your selfish pleasures-hear your doom.  You shall alwaysblow in the hot, dry weather, and shall parch and shrivel all livingthings.  And men shall detest and avoid you from this very time."(And that is why the Wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable.)But to Moon she said, "Daughter, because you remembered your mother,and kept for her a share in your own enjoyment, from henceforth youshall be ever cool, and calm and bright.  No noxious glare shallaccompany your pure rays, and men shall always call you 'blessed."(And that is why the Moon's light is so soft, and cool, and beautifuleven to this day.)WHY THE FISH LAUGHEDBy Joseph JacobsAs a certain fisherwoman passed by a palace crying her fish, the queenappeared at one of the windows and beckoned her to come near and showwhat she had.  At that moment a very big fish jumped about in thebottom of the basket."Is it a he or a she?"  inquired the queen.  "I wish to purchase a shefish."On hearing this the fish laughed aloud."It's a he," replied the fisherwoman, and proceeded on her rounds.The queen returned to her room in a great rage; and on coming to seeher in the evening, the king noticed that something had disturbed her."Are you indisposed?"  he said."No; but I am very much annoyed at the strange behavior of a fish.  Awoman brought me one to-day, and on my inquiring whether it was a maleor female, the fish laughed most rudely.""A fish laugh! Impossible! You must be dreaming.""I am not a fool.  I speak of what I have seen with my own eyes andheard with my own ears.""Passing strange! Be it so.  I will inquire concerning it."On the morrow the king repeated to his vizier what his wife had toldhim, and bade him investigate the matter, and be ready with asatisfactory answer within six mouths, on pain of death.  The vizierpromised to do his best, though he felt almost certain of failure.  Forlive months he labored indefatigably to find a reason for the laughterof the fish.  He sought everywhere and from everyone.  The wise andlearned, and they who were skilled in magic and in all manner oftrickery, were consulted.  Nobody, however, could explain the matter;and so he returned broken-hearted to his house, and began to arrangehis affairs in prospect of certain death, for he had had sufficientexperience of the king to know that His Majesty would not go back fromhis threat.  Amongst other things, he advised his son to travel for atime, until the king's anger should have somewhat cooled.The young fellow, who was both clever and handsome, started offwhithersoever Kismet might lead him.  He had been gone some days, whenhe fell in with an old farmer, who also was on a journey to a certainvillage.  Finding the old man very pleasant, he asked him if he mightaccompany him, professing to be on a visit to the same place.  The oldfarmer agreed, and they walked along together.  The day was hot, andthe way was long and weary."Don't yon think it would be pleasanter if you and I sometimes gave oneanother a lift?"  said the youth."What a fool the man is!" thought the old farmer.Presently they passed through a field of corn ready for the sickle, andlooking' like a sea of gold as it waved to and fro in the breeze."Is this eaten or not?"  said the young man.Not understanding his meaning, the old man replied, "I don't know."After a little while the two travelers arrived at a big village, wherethe young man gave his companion a clasp knife, and said, "Take this,friend, and get two horses with it; but mind and bring it back, for itis very precious."The old man, looking half amused and half angry, pushed back the knife,muttering something to the effect that his friend was either a foolhimself or else tying to play the fool with him.  The young manpretended not to notice his reply, and remained almost silent till theyreached the city, a short distance outside which was the old farmer'shouse.They walked about the bazaar and went to the mosque, but nobody salutedthem or invited them to come in and rest."What a large cemetery!" exclaimed the young man."What does the man mean," thought the old farmer, "calling this largelypopulated city a cemetery?"On leaving the city their way led through a cemetery where a few peoplewere praying beside a grave and distributing chupatties and kulchas toPassers-by, in the name of their beloved dead.  They beckoned to thetwo travelers and gave them as much as they would."What a splendid city this is!" said the young man."Now, the man must surely be demented!"  thought the old farmer.  "Iwonder what he will do next?  He will be calling the land water, andthe water land; and be speaking of light where there is darkness, andof darkness where it is light."  However, he kept his thoughts tohimself.Presently they had to wade through a stream that ran along the edge ofthe cemetery.  The water was rather deep, so the old farmer took offhis shoes and pajamas and crossed over; but the young man waded throughit with his shoes and pajamas on."Well!  I never did see such a perfect fool, both in word and in deed,said the old man to himself.However, he liked the fellow; and thinking that he would amuse his wifeand daughter, he invited him to come and stay at his house as long ashe had occasion to remain in the village."Thank you very much," the young man replied; "but let me firstinquire, if you please, whether the beam of your house is strong. "The old farmer left him in despair, and entered his house laughing."There is a man in yonder field," he said, after returning theirgreetings.  "He 'has come the greater part of the way with me, and Iwanted him to put up here as long as he had to stay in this village.But the fellow is such a fool that I cannot make anything out of him.He wants to know if the beam of this house is all right.  The man mustbe mad!" and saying this he burst into a fit of laughter."Father," said the farmer's daughter, who was a very sharp and wisegirl, "this man, whosoever he is, is no fool, as you deem him.  He onlywishes to know if you can afford to entertain him.""Oh! of course," replied the farmer.  "I see.  Well perhaps you canhelp me to solve some of his other mysteries.  While we were walkingtogether he asked whether he should carry me or I should carry him, ashe thought that would be a pleasanter mode of proceeding.""Most assuredly," said the girl.  "He meant that one of you should tella story to beguile the time.""Oh, yes.  Well, we were passing through a cornfield, when he asked mewhether it was eaten or not.""And didn't you know the meaning of this, father?  He simply wished toknow if the man was in debt or not; because if the owner of the fieldwas in debt, then the produce of the field was as good as eaten to him;that is, it would have to go to his creditors.""Yes, yes, yes; of course!  Then, on entering a certain village, hebade me take his clasp knife and get two horses with it, and bring backthe knife again to him.""Are not two stout sticks as good as two horses for helping one alongon the road?  He only asked you to cut a couple of sticks and becareful not to lose his knife.""I see," said time farmer.  "While we were walking over the city we didnot see anybody that we knew, and not a soul gave us a scrap ofanything to eat, till we were passing the cemetery; but there somepeople called to us and put into our hands some chupatties and kulchas;so my companion called the city a cemetery, and the cemetery a city.""This also is to be understood, father, if one thinks of the city asthe place where everything is to be obtained, and of inhospitablepeople as worse than the dead.  The city, though crowded with people,was as if dead, as far as you were concerned; while, in the cemetery,which is crowded with time dead, you were saluted by kind friends andprovided with bread.""True, true!" said the astonished farmer.  "Then, just now, when wewere crossing the stream, he waded through it without taking off hisshoes and pajamas.''"I admire his wisdom," replied time girl.  "I have often thought howstupid people were to venture into that swiftly flowing stream and overthose sharp stones with bare feet.  The slightest stumble and theywould fall, and be wetted from head to foot.  This friend of yours is amost wise man.  I should like to see him and speak to him.""Very well," said time farmer; "I will go and find him, and bring himin.""Tell him, father, that our beams are strong enough, and then he willcome in.  I'll send on ahead a present to the man, to show him that wecan afford to have him for our guest."Accordingly she called a servant and sent him to the young man with apresent of a basin of ghee, twelve chupatties, and a jar of milk, andthe following message: "O friend, time moon is full; twelve months makea year, and the sea is overflowing with water."Half-way the bearer of this present and message met his little son,who, seeing what was in the basket, begged his father to give him someof the food.  His father foolishly complied.  Presently he saw theyoung man, and gave him the rest of the present and the message."Give your mistress my salaam," he replied, "and tell her that the moonis new, and that I can only find eleven mouths in the year, and the seais by no means full."Not understanding the meaning of these words, the servant repeated themword for word, as he had heard them, to his mistress; and thus histheft was discovered, and he was severely punished.  After a littlewhile the young man appeared with the old farmer.  Great attention wasshown to him, and he was treated in every way as it he were the son ofa great man, although his humble host knew nothing of his origin.  Atlength be told them everything-about the laughing of the fish, hisfather's threatened execution, and his own banishment-and asked theiradvice as to what he should do."The laughing of the fish,'' said the girl "which seems to have beenthe cause of all this trouble, indicates that there is a man in thepalace who is plotting against the king's life.""Joy, joy!" exclaimed the vizier's son.  "There is yet time for me toreturn and save my father from an ignominious and unjust death, and theking from danger."The following day he hastened back to his own country, taking with himthe farmer's daughter.  Immediately on arrival he ran to the palace andinformed his father of what he had heard.  The poor vizier, now almostdead from the expectation of death, was at once carried to the king, towhom he repeated the news that his son had just brought."Never!" said the king."But it must be so, Your Majesty," replied the vizier; "and in order toprove the truth of what I have heard, I pray you call together all themaids in your palace, and order them to jump over a pit, which must bedug.  We'll soon find out whether there is any man there."The king had time pit dug, and commanded all the maids belonging to thepalace to try to jump it.  All of them tried, but only one succeeded.That one was found to be a man!Thus was the queen satisfied, and the faithful old vizier saved.Afterward, as soon as could be, the vizier's son married the oldfarmer's daughter; and a most happy marriage it was.THE FARMER AND THE MONEY LENDERBy Joseph JacobsTHERE was ounce a farmer who suffered much at time hands of the moneylender.  Good harvests, or bad, the farmer was always poor, the moneylender rich.  At the last, when he hadn't a farthing left, the farmerwent to the money lender's house, and said, "You can't squeeze waterfrom a stone, and as you have nothing to get by me now, you might tellme the secret of becoming rich.""My friend," returned the money lender, piously, "riches come from Ram-ask him.""Thank you, I will!" replied the simple farmer; so he prepared threegriddle cakes to last him on the journey, and set out to find Ram.First he met a Brahman, and to him he gave a cake asking him to pointout the road to Ram; but the Brahman only took the cake and went on hisway without a word.  Next the farmer met a Jogi or devotee, and to himhe gave a cake, without receiving any help in return.  At last, he cameupon a poor man sitting under a tree, and finding out he was hungry,the kindly farmer gave him his last cake, and sitting clown to restbeside him, entered into conversation."And where are you going?"  asked the poor man, at length."Oh, I have a long journey before me, for I am going to find Ram!"replied the farmer.  "I don't suppose you could tell me which way togo?""Perhaps I can," said the poor man, smiling, "for I am Ram! What do youwant of me?"Then the farmer told the whole story, and Rain, taking pity on him,gave him a conch shell, and showed him how to blow it in a particularway, saying, "Remember! whatever you wish for, you have only to blowthe conch that way, and your wish will be fulfilled.  Only have a careof that money lender, for even magic is not proof against their wiles!"The farmer went back to his village rejoicing.  In fact the moneylender noticed his high spirits at once, and said to himself, "Somegood fortune must have befallen the stupid fellow, to make him hold hishead so jauntily."  Therefore he went over to the simple farmer'shouse, and congratulated him on his good fortune, in such cunningwords, pretending to have heard all about it, that before long thefarmer found himself telling the whole story-all except the secret ofblowing the conch, for, with all his simplicity, the farmer was notquite such a fool as to tell that.Nevertheless, the money lender determined to have the conch by hook orby crook, and as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles, hewaited for a favorable opportunity and stole the conch.But, after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in everyconceivable way, he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad job.However, being determined to succeed he went back to the farmer andsaid, coolly, "Look here; I've got your conch, but I can't use it; youhaven't got it, So it's clear you can't use it either.  Business is ata standstill unless we make a bargain.  Now, I promise to give you backyour conch, and never to interfere with your using it, on onecondition, which is this-Whatever you get from it, I am to get double.""Never!" cried the farmer; "that would be the old business all overagain!""Not at all!" replied time wily money lender; "you will have yourshare!  Now, don't be a dog in the manger, for if you get all you want,what can it matter to you if I am rich or poor?"At last, though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefitto a money lender, the farmer was forced to yield, and from that time,no matter what he gained by the power of the couch, time money lendergained double.  And the knowledge that this was so preyed upon thefarmer's mind day and night, so that he had no satisfaction out ofanything.At last, there came a very dry season-so dry that the farmer's cropswithered for want of rain.  Then he blew his conch, and wished for awell to water them, and lo! there was the well, but the money lenderhad two!-two beautiful new wells!  This was too much for any farmer tostand: and our friend brooded over it, and brooded over it, till atlast a bright idea came into his head.  He seized the conch, blew itloudly, and cried out, "Oh Ram!  I wish to be blind of one eye!"  Andso he was in a twinkling, but the money lender of course was blind ofboth, and in trying to steer his way between the two new wells, he fellinto one and was drowned.Now this true story shows that a farmer once got time better of a moneylender-but only by losing one of his eyes.PRIDE GOETH BEFORE A FALLBy Joseph JacobsIN a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants who always wentabout together.  Once upon a time they had traveled far afield, andwere returning home with a great deal of money which they had obtainedby selling their wares.  Now there happened to be a dense forest neartheir village, and this they reached early one morning.  In it therelived three notorious robbers, of whose existence the traders had neverheard, and while they were still in the middle of it the robbers stoodbefore them, with swords and cudgels in their hands, and ordered themto lay down all they had.  The traders had no weapons with them, andso, though they were many more in number, they had to submit themselvesto the robbers, who took away everything from them, even the veryclothes they wore, and gave to each only a small loin cloth a span inbreadth and a cubit in length.The idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all theirproperty now took possession of the robbers' minds.  They seatedthemselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered, andordered them to dance to them before returning home.  The merchants nowmourned their fate.They had lost all they had, except their loin cloth, and still therobbers were not satisfied, but ordered them to dance.There was, among the ten merchants, one who was very clever.  Hepondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends, thedance they would have to perform, and the magnificent manner in whichthe three robbers had seated themselves on the grass.  At the same timehe observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground, inthe assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders, who were nowcommencing to dance.  So he took the lead in the dance, and, as a songis always sung by the leader on such occasions, to which the rest keeptime with hands and feet, he thus began to sing:	We are enty men,	They are erith men:	If each erith man	Surround eno men,	Eno man remains.	Ta, tai, tom, tadingana.The robbers were all uneducated, and thought that the leader was merelysinging a song as usual.  So it was in one sense: for the leadercommenced from a distance, and had sung the song over twice before heand his companions commenced to approach the robbers.  They hadunderstood his meaning, because they had been trained in trade.When two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of apurchaser, they use a riddling sort of language."What is the price of this cloth?"  one trader will ask another."Enty rupees," another will reply, meaning "ten rupees."Thus, there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meantunless he be acquainted with trade language.  By the rules of thissecret language erith means "three," enty means "ten," and eno means"one."  So the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellow-tradersthat they were ten men, the robbers only three, that if three pouncedupon each of the robbers, nine of them could hold them down, while theremaining one bound the robbers' hands and feet.The three thieves, glorying in their victory, and little understandingthe meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers, were proudlyseated chewing betel and tobacco.  Meanwhile the song was sung a thirdtime.  Ta, tai, tom had left the lips of the singer; and, beforetadingana was out of them, the traders separated into parties of three,and each party pounced upon a thief.  The remaining one-the leaderhimself-tore up into long narrow strips a large piece of cloth, sixcubits long, and tied the hands and feet of the robbers.  These wereentirely humbled now, and rolled on the ground like three bags of rice!The ten traders now took back all their property, and armed themselveswith the swords and cudgels of their enemies; and when they reachedtheir village, they often amused their friends and relatives byrelating their adventure.HOW THE WICKED SONS WERE DUPEDBy Joseph JacobsA VERY wealthy old man, imagining that he was on the point of death,sent for his sons and divided his property among them.  However, he didnot die for several years afterward, and miserable years many of themwere.  Besides the weariness of old age, the old fellow had to bearwith much abuse and cruelty from his sons.  Wretched, selfish ingrates!Previously they vied with one another in trying to please their father,hoping thus to receive more money, but now they had received theirpatrimony, they cared not how soon he left them-nay, the sooner thebetter, because he was only a needless trouble and expense.  And theylet the poor old man know what they felt.One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles.  Thefriend sympathized very much with him, and promised to think over thematter, and call in a little while and tell him what to do.  He did so;in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full ofstones and gravel before him."Look here, friend," said he.  "Your sons will get to know of my cominghere to-day, and will inquire about it.  You must pretend that I cameto discharge a long-standing debt with you, and that you are severalthousands of rupees richer than you thought you were.  Keep these bagsin your own hands, and on no account let your sons get to them as longas you are alive.  You will soon find them change their conduct towardyou.  Salaam, I will come again soon to see how you are getting on."When the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth theybegan to be more attentive and pleasing to their father than everbefore.  And thus they continued to the day of the old man's demise,when the bags were greedily opened, and found to contain only stonesand gravel!THE TIGER, THE BRAHMAN, AND THE JACKALBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time a Tiger was caught in a trap.  He tried in vain to getout through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when hefailed.By chance a poor Brahman came by."Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!" cried the Tiger."Nay, my friend," replied the Brahman mildly, you would probably eat meif I did.""Not at all!" swore the Tiger with many oaths; "on the contrary, Ishould be forever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"Now when the Tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the piousBrahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door ofthe cage.  Out popped the Tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried,"What a fool you are!  What is to prevent my eating you now, for afterbeing cooped up so long I am terribly hungry!"In vain the Brahman Pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was apromise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose toquestion as to the justice of the Tiger's action.So the Brahman first asked a Pipal Tree what it thought of the matter,but the Pipal Tree replied coldly, "What have you to complain about?Don't I give shade and shelter to everyone who passes by, and don'tthey in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle?  Don'twhimper-be a. man! "Then the Brahman sad at heart, went farther afield till he saw aBuffalo turning a well wheel; but he fared no better from it, for itanswered, "You are a fool to expect gratitude!  Look at me!  While Igave milk they fed me on cottonseed and oil cake, but now I am dry theyyoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!"The Brahman, still more sad, asked the Road to give him its opinion."My dear sir,'' said the Road, "how foolish you are to expect anythingelse!  Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, greatand small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but theashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!"On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met aJackal, who called out, "Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman?  You lookas miserable as a fish out of water!"The Brahman told him all that had occurred."How very confusing!" said the Jackal, when the recital was ended;"would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixedup?"The Brahman told it all over again, but the Jackal shook his head in adistracted sort of way, and still could not understand."It's very odd," said he, sadly, "but it all seems to go in at one earand out at the other!  I will go to the place where it all happened,and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment. "So they returned to the cage, by which the Tiger was waiting for theBrahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws."You've been away a long time!" growled the savage beast, "but now letus begin our dinner.""Our dinner!" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knockedtogether with fright; "what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!""Give mime five minutes, my lord!" he pleaded, "in order that I mayexplain matters to the Jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."The Tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again,not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible.''Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!" cried the Jackal, wringing itspaws.  "Let me see! how did it all begin?  You were in the cage, andthe Tiger came walking by-""Pooh!" interrupted the Tiger, "what a fool you are!  I was in thecage.""Of course!" cried the Jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; "yesI was in the cage-no I wasn't-dear! dear, where are my wits?  Let mesee-the Tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by-no,that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, forI shall never understand!""Yes, you shall!" returned the Tiger, in a rage at the Jackal'sstupidity; "I'll make you understand!  Look here-I am the Tiger-""Yes, my lord!""And that is the Brahman-""Yes, my lord!""And that is the cage-""Yes, my lord!""And I was in the cage-do you understand?""Yes-no- Please, my lord-""Well?"  cried the Tiger impatiently."Please, my lord !-how did you get in?""How?-why, in the usual way, of course! ""Oh, dear me!-My head is beginning to whirl again! Please don't getangry, my lord, but what is the usual way?"At this the Tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried,"This way!  Now do you understand how it was?""Perfectly!" grinned the Jackal, as he dexterously shut the door.  "Andif you will permit me to say so, I think matters will remain as theywere!"THE LAMBIKINBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about onhis little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly.Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy tothink of all the good things he should get from her, when who should hemeet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said:"Lambikin!  Lambikin!  I'll EAT YOU!"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:	"To Granny's house I go,	Where I shall fatter grow,	Then you can eat me so."The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.By and by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at thetender morsel before him, said: "Lambikin!  Lambikin!  I'll EAT YOU!"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:	"To Granny's house I go,	Where I shall fatter grow,	Then you can eat me so."The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.And by and by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, arid anEagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:"Lambikin!  Lambikin!  I'll EAT YOU!"But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:	"To Granny's house I go,	Where I shall fatter grow,	Then you can eat me so.At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry,"Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought tokeep their promises, please put me into the corn bin at once."So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn bin,and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate,and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny saidhe was fat enough for anything, and must go home.  But cunning littleLambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eathim on the way back, he was so plump and tender."I'll tell you what you must do," said Master Lambikin, "you must makea little drumikin out of the skin of' my little brother who died, andthen I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as adrum myself."So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin,with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm inthe middle, and trundled away gayly.  Soon lie met with the Eagle, whocalled out:	"Drumikin!  Drumikin!	Have you seen Lambikin?"And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:	"Fallen into the fire, and so will you	On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!""How very annoying!" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of thetender morsel he had let slip.Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:	"Tum-pa, tum-too;	Tum-pa, tum-too!"Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:	"Drumikin!  Drumikin!	Have you seen Lambikin?"And to each of them the little slyboots replied:	"Fallen into the fire, and so will you	On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum-too;	Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!"Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had letslip.At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharpas a needle, and he too called out-	"Drumikin!  Drumikin!	Have you seen Lambikin?"And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gayly:	"Fallen into the fire, and so will you	On little Drumikin!  Tum-pa-"But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognized his voice atonce, arid cried: "Hullo!  you've turned yourself inside out, have you?Just you come out of that!"Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.THE RAT'S WEDDINGBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time a fat, sleek Rat was caught in a shower of rain, andbeing far from shelter he set to work and soon dug a nice hole in theground, in which he sat as dry as a bone while the raindrops splashedoutside, making little puddles on the road.Now in the course of digging, he came upon a fine bit of root, quitedry and fit for fuel, which he set aside carefully-for the Rat is aneconomical creature--in order to take it home with him.  So when theshower was over, he set off with the dry root in his mouth.  As he wentalong, daintily picking his way through the puddles, he Saw a Poor Manvainly trying to light a fire, while a little circle of children stoodby, and cried piteously."Goodness gracious!" exclaimed the Rat, who was both soft-hearted andcurious, "What a dreadful noise to make!  What is the matter?""The children are hungry," answered the Man; "they are crying for theirbreakfast, but the sticks are damp, the fire won't burn, and so I can'tbake the cakes.""If that is all your trouble, perhaps I can help you," said the good-natured Rat, "you are welcome to this dry root and I'll warrant it willsoon make a fine blaze."The Poor Man, with a thousand thanks, took the dry root, and in histurn presented the Rat with a morsel of dough, as a reward for hiskindness and generosity."What a remarkably lucky fellow I am!" thought the Rat, as he trottedoff gayly with his prize, "and clever, too!  Fancy making a bargainlike that-food enough to last me five days in return for a rotten oldstick!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  What it is to have brains!"Going along, hugging his good fortune in this way, he came presently toa Potter's yard, where the Potter, leaving his wheel to spin round byitself, was trying to pacify his three little children, who werescreaming arid crying as if they would burst."My gracious!" cried the Rat, stopping his ears, "what a noise!  dotell me what it is all about.""I suppose they are hungry," replied the Potter ruefully; "their motherhas gone to get flour in the bazaar, for there is none in the house.In the meantime I can neither work nor rest because of them.""Is that all?" answered the officious Rat; then I can help you.  Takethis dough, cook it quickly, and stop their mouths with food."The Potter overwhelmed the Rat with thanks for his obliging kindness,and choosing out a nice well-burned pipkin, insisted on his acceptingit as a remembrance.The Rat was delighted at the exchange, and though the pipkin was just atrifle awkward for him to manage, he succeeded, after infinite trouble,in balancing it on his head and went away gingerly, tink-a-tink, tin k-a-tink, down the road, with his tail over his arm for fear he shouldtrip on it.  And all the time he kept saying to himself, "What a luckyfellow I am!  and clever, too!  Such a hand at a bargain!"By and by he came to where some cowherds were herding their cattle.One of them was milking a buffalo, and having no pail, he used hisshoes instead."Oh fie!  oh fie!" cried the cleanly Rat, quite shocked at the sight."What a nasty, dirty trick!  Why don't you use a pail?""For the best of all reasons-we haven't got one!" growled the Cowherd,who did not see why the Rat should put his finger in the pie."If that is all," replied the dainty Rat, "oblige me by using thispipkin, for I cannot bear dirt!"The Cowherd, nothing loath, took the pipkin and milked away until itwas brimming over; then turning to the Rat, who stood looking on, said,"Here, little fellow, You may have a drink, in payment."But if the Rat was good-natured he was also shrewd.  "No, no, myfriend," said he, "that will not do!  As if I could drink the worth ofany pipkin at a draft!  My dear sir, I couldn't hold it!  Besides, Inever make a bad bargain, so I expect you, at least to give me thebuffalo that gave the milk.""Nonsense!" cried the Cowherd; "a buffalo for a pipkin!  Whoever heardof such a price?  And what on earth could you do with a buffalo whenyou got it?  Why, the pipkin was about as much as you could manage."At this the Rat drew himself up with dignity, for he did not likeallusions to his size.  "That is my affair, not yours," he retorted;"your business is to hand over the buffalo."So just for the fun of the thing, and to amuse themselves at the Rat'sexpense, the cowherds loosened the buffalo's halter and began to tie itto the little animal's tail."No!  no!' he called, in a great hurry.  "If the beast pulled, the skinof my tail would come off, and then where should I be?  Tie it aroundmy neck, if you please."So with much laughter the cowherds tied the halter round the Rat'sneck, and he, after a polite leave-taking, set off gayly toward homewith his prize; that is to say, he set off with the rope, for no soonerdid he come to the end of the tether than be was brought up with around turn; the buffalo, nose down, grazing away, would not budge untilit had finished its tuft of grass, and then seeing another in adifferent direction marched off toward it, while the Rat, to avoidbeing dragged, had to trot humbly behind, willy-nilly.  He was tooproud to confess the truth, of course, and, nodding his head knowinglyto the cowherds, said: "Ta-ta, good people!  I am going home this way.It may be a little longer, but it's much shadier."And when the cowherds roared with laughter he took no notice, buttrotted on, looking as dignified as possible.  "After all," he reasonedto himself, "when one keeps a buffalo one has to look after itsgrazing.  A beast must get a good bellyful of grass if it is to giveany milk, and I have plenty of time at my disposal."  So all day longhe trotted about after the buffalo, making believe; but by evening hewas dead tired, and felt truly thankful when the great big beast,having eaten enough, lay down under a tree to chew the cud.Just then a bridal party came by.  The Bridegroom and his friends hadevidently gone on to the next village, leaving the Bride's palanquin tofollow; so the palanquin bearers, being lazy fellows and seeing a niceshady tree, put down their burden, and began to cook some food."What detestable meanness!" grumbled one; "a grand wedding, and nothingbut plain rice to eat!  Not a scrap of meat in it, neither sweet norsalt!  It would serve the skinflints right if we upset the Bride into aditch!""Dear me!" cried the Rat at once, seeing a way out of his difficulty,"that is a shame!  I sympathize with your feelings so entirely that ifyou will allow me, I'll give you my buffalo.  You can kill it, and cookit.""Your buffalo!" returned the discontented bearers.  "What rubbish!Whoever heard of a rat owning a buffalo?""Not often, I admit," replied the Rat with conscious pride; "but lookfor yourselves.  Can you not see that I am leading the beast by astring?""Oh, never mind the string!" cried a great big hungry bearer; master orno master, I mean to have meat for my dinner!"  Whereupon they killedthe buffalo, and cooking its flesh, ate their dinner with a relish;then, offering the remains to the Rat, said carelessly, "Here, littleRat-skin, that is for you!""Now look here!" cried the Rat hotly; "I'll have none of your pottage,or your sauce, either.  You don't suppose I am going to give my bestbuffalo, that gave quarts and quarts of milk-the buffalo I have beenfeeding all day-for a wee bit of rice?  No!  I got a loaf for a bit ofstick; I got a pipkin for a little loaf; I got a buffalo for a pipkin;and now I'll have the Bride for my buffalo-the Bride, and nothingelse!"By this time the servants, having satisfied their hunger, began toreflect on what they had done, and becoming alarmed at theconsequences, arrived at the conclusion it would be wisest to maketheir escape while they could.  So, leaving the Bride in her palanquin,they took to their heels in various directions.The Rat, being as it were left in possession, advanced to thepalanquin, and drawing aside the curtain, with the sweetest of voicesand best of bows begged the Bride to descend.  She hardly knew whetherto laugh or to cry, but as any company, even a Rat's, was better thanbeing quite alone in the wilderness, she did what she was bidden, andfollowed the lead of her guide, who set off as fast as be could for hishole.As he trotted along beside the lovely young Bride, who, by her richdress and glittering jewels, seemed to be some king's daughter, he keptsaying to himself, "How clever I am!  What bargains I do make, to besure!"When they arrived at his hole, the Rat stepped forward with thegreatest politeness, and said, "Welcome, madam, to my humble abode!Pray step in, or if you will allow me, and as the passage is somewhatdark, I will show you the way."Whereupon he ran in first, but after a time, finding the Bride did notfollow, he put his nose out again, saying testily, "Well, madam, whydon't you follow?  Don't you know it's rude to keep your husbandwaiting?""My good sir," laughed the handsome young Bride, "I can't squeeze intothat little hole!"The Rat coughed; then after a moment's thought he replied, "There issome truth in your remark- you are overgrown, and I suppose I shallhave to build you a thatch somewhere, For to-night you can rest underthat wild plum tree.""But I am so hungry!" said the Bride ruefully."Dear, dear!  everybody seems hungry to-day!" returned the Ratpettishly; "however, that's easily settled-I'll fetch you Some supperin a trice."So he ran into his hole, returning immediately with an ear of milletand a dry pea.  "There!" said he, triumphantly, "isn't that a finemeal?""I can't eat that!" whimpered the Bride; "it isn't a mouthful; and Iwant rice pottage, and cakes, and sweet eggs, and sugar drops.  I shalldie if I don't get them!""Oh, dear me!" cried the Rat in a rage, "what a nuisance a bride is, tobe sure!  Why don't you eat the wild plums?""I can't live on wild plums!" retorted the weeping Bride; "nobodycould; besides, they are only half ripe, and I can't reach them.""Rubbish!" cried the Rat; "ripe or unripe, they must do you for to-night, and to-morrow you can gather a basketful, sell them in the city,and buy sugar drops and sweet eggs to your heart's content!"So the next morning the Rat climbed up into the plum tree, and nibbledaway at the stalks till the fruit fell down into the Bride's veil.Then, unripe as they were, she carried them into the city, calling outthrough the streets-	"Green plums I sell!  green plums I sell!	Princess am I, Rat's bride as well!"As she passed by the palace, her mother, the Queen, heard her voice,and running out, recognized her daughter.  Great were the rejoicings,for everyone thought the poor Bride had been eaten by wild beasts.In the midst of the feasting and merriment, the Rat, who had followedthe Princess at a distance, and had become alarmed at her long absence,arrived at the door, against which he beat with a big knobby stick,calling out fiercely, "Give me my wife!  Give me my wife!  She is mineby a fair bargain.  I gave a stick and I got a loaf; I gave a loaf andI got a pipkin; I gave a pipkin and I got a buffalo; I gave a buffaloand I got a bride.  Give me my wife!  Give me my wife!""La!  son-in-law!  What a fuss you do make," said the wily old Queenthrough the door, "and all about nothing!  Who wants to run away withyour wife?  On the contrary, we are proud to see you, and I only keepyou waiting at the door till we can spread the carpets, and receive youin style."Hearing this, the Rat was mollified, and waited patiently outside whilethe cunning old Queen prepared for his reception, which she did bycutting a hole in the very middle of a stool, putting a red hot stoneunderneath, covering it over with a stew-pan lid, and then spreading abeautiful embroidered cloth over all.  Then she went to the door, andreceiving the Rat with the greatest respect, led him to the stool,praying him to be seated."Dear!  dear!  how clever I am!  What bargains I do make, to be sure!"said he to himself as he climbed on to the stool.  "Here I am, son-in-law to a real live Queen!  What will the neighbors say?"At first he sat down on the edge of the stool, but even there it waswarm, and after a while he began to fidget, saying, "Dear me, mother-in-law, how hot your house is!  Everything I touch seems burning!""You are out of the wind there, my son," replied the cunning old Queen;"sit more in the middle of the stool, and then you will feel the breezeand get cooler."But he didn't!  for the stewpan lid by this time had become so hot thatthe Rat fairly frizzled when he sat down on it; and it was not until hehad left all his tail, half his hair, and a large piece of his skinbehind him, that he managed to escape, howling with pain, and vowingthat never, never, never again would he make a bargain!THE JACKAL AND THE PARTRIDGEBy Flora Annie SteelA JACKAL and a partridge swore eternal friendship; but the Jackal wasvery exacting and jealous.  "You don't do half as much for me as I dofor you," he used to say, "and yet you talk a great deal of yourfriendship.  Now my idea of a friend is one who is able to make melaugh or cry, give me a good meal, or save my life if need be.  Youcouldn't do that!""Let us see," answered the Partridge; "follow me at a little distance,and if I don't make you laugh soon you may eat me!"So she flew on till she met two travelers trudging along, one behindthe other.  They were both foot-sore and weary, and the first carriedhis bundle on a stick over his shoulder, while the second had his shoesin his hand.Lightly as a feather the Partridge settled on the first traveler'sstick.  He, none the wiser, trudged on, but the second traveler, seeingthe bird sitting so tamely just in front of his nose, said to himself,"What a chance for a supper!" and immediately flung his shoes at it,they being ready to hand.  Whereupon the Partridge flew away, and theshoes knocked off the first traveler's turban."What a plague do you mean?" cried he, angrily turning on hiscompanion.  "Why did you throw your shoes at my head?""Brother," replied the other mildly, "do not be vexed.  I didn't throwthem at you, but at a Partridge that was sitting on your stick.""On my stick!  Do you take me for a fool?" shouted the injured man, ina great rage.  "Don't tell me such cock-and-bull stories.  First youinsult me, and then you lie like a coward; but I'll teach you manners!"Then he fell upon his fellow traveler without more ado, and they foughtuntil they could not see out of their eyes, till their noses werebleeding, their clothes in rags, and the Jackal had nearly died oflaughing."Are you satisfied?" asked the Partridge of her friend."Well," answered the Jackal, "you have certainly made nine laugh, but Idoubt if you could make me cry.  It is easy enough to be a buffoon; itis more difficult to excite the highest emotions.""Let us see," retorted the Partridge, somewhat piqued; "there is ahuntsman with his dogs coming along the road.  Just creep into thathollow tree and watch me; if you don't weep scalding tears, you musthave no feeling in you!"The Jackal did as he was bid, and watched the Partridge, who beganfluttering about the bushes till the dogs caught sight of her, when sheflew to the hollow tree where the Jackal was hidden.  Of course thedogs smelt him at once, and set up such a yelping and scratching thatthe huntsman came up, and seeing what it was, dragged the Jackal out bythe tail.  Whereupon the dogs worried him to their heart's content, andfinally left him for dead.By and by he opened his eyes-for he was only foxing-and saw thePartridge sitting on a branch above him."Did you cry?" she asked anxiously.  "Did I rouse your high emo---""Be quiet, will you!" snarled the Jackal; half dead with fear!"So there the Jackal lay for some time, getting the better of hisbruises, and meanwhile he became hungry."Now is the time for friendship!" said he to the Partridge.  "Get me agood dinner, and I will acknowledge you a true friend.""Very well!" replied the Partridge; "only watch me, and help yourselfwhen the time comes."Just then a troop of women came by, carrying their husbands dinners tothe harvest field.  The Partridge gave a little plaintive cry, andbegan fluttering along from bush to bush as if she were wounded."A wounded bird!  a wounded bird!" cried the women; "we can easilycatch it."  Whereupon they set off in pursuit, but the cunningPartridge played a thousand tricks, till they became so excited overthe chase that they put their bundles on the ground in order to pursueit more nimbly.  The Jackal, meanwhile, seizing his opportunity, creptup, and made off with a good dinner."Are you satisfied now?" asked the Partridge."Well," returned the Jackal, "I confess you have given me a very gooddinner; you have also made me laugh-and cry-ahem!  But, after all, thegreat test of friendship is beyond you-you couldn't save my life!""Perhaps not," acquiesced the Partridge mournfully, "I am so small andweak.  But it grows late-we should be getting home; and as it is a longway round by the ford, let us go across the river.  My friend theCrocodile will carry us over."Accordingly they set off for the river, and the Crocodile kindlyconsented to carry them across, so they sat on his broad back and heferried them over.  But just as they were in the middle of the streamthe Partridge remarked.  "I believe the Crocodile intends to play us atrick.  How awkward if he were to drop you into the water!""Awkward for you, too!" replied the Jackal, turning pale."Not at all!  not at all!  I have wings, you haven't."On this the Jackal shivered and shook with fear, and when theCrocodile, in a gruesome growl, remarked that he was hungry and wanteda good meal, the wretched creature hadn't a word to say."Pooh!" cried the Partridge airily, "don't try tricks on us-I shouldfly away, and as for my friend, the Jackal, you couldn't hurt him.  Heis not such a fool as to take his life with him on these littleexcursions; he leaves it at home, locked up in the cupboard.""Is that a fact?" asked the Crocodile, surprised. "Certainly!" retortedthe Partridge.  Try to eat him if you like, but you will only tireyourself to no purpose."Dear me!  how very odd!" gasped time Crocodile; and he was so takenaback that he carried the Jackal safe to shore."Well, are you satisfied now?" asked the Partridge."My dear madam!" quoth the Jackal, "you have made me laugh, you havemade me cry, you have given me a good dinner, and you have saved mylife; but, upon my honor, I think you are too clever for a friend sogood-by!"And the Jackal never went near the Partridge again.THE JACKAL AND THE CROCODILEBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time Mr. Jackal was trotting along gayly, when lie caughtsight of a wild plum tree laden with fruit on the other side of abroad, deep stream.  I could not get across anyhow, so he just sat downon the bank and looked at the ripe, luscious fruit until his mouthwatered with desire.Now it so happened that, just then, Miss Crocodile came floating downstream with her nose in the air."Good morning, my dear!" said Mr. Jackal politely; "how beautiful youlook to-day, and how charmingly you swim!  Now, if I could only swimtoo, what a fine feast of plums we two friends might have over theretogether!"  And Mr. Jackal laid his paw on his heart, and sighed.Now Miss Crocodile had a very inflammable heart, and when Mr. Jackallooked at her so admiringly, and spoke so sentimentally, she simperedand blushed, saying, "Oh!  Mr. Jackal!  how can you talk so?  I couldnever dream of going out to dinner with you, unless-unless-""Unless what?" asked the Jackal persuasively."Unless we were going to be married!" simpered Miss Crocodile."And why shouldn't we be married, my charmer?" returned the Jackaleagerly.  "I would go and fetch the barber to begin the betrothal atonce, but I am so faint with hunger just at present that I should neverreach the village.  Now, if the most adorable of her sex would onlytake pity on her slave, and carry me over the stream, I might refreshmyself with those plums, and so gain strength to accomplish the ardentdesire of my heart!"Here the Jackal sighed so piteously, and cast such sheep's eyes at MissCrocodile, that she was unable to withstand him.  So she carried himacross to the plum tree, and then sat on the water's edge to think overher wedding dress, while Mr. Jackal feasted on the plums and enjoyedhimself."Now for the barber, my beauty!" cried the gay Jackal, when he hadeaten as much as he could.  Then the blushing Miss Crocodile carriedhim back again, and bade him be quick about his business, like a deargood creature, for really she felt so flustered at the very idea thatshe didn't know what might happen."Now don't distress yourself, my dear!" quoth the deceitful Mr. Jackal,springing to the bank, "because it's not impossible that I may not findthe barber, and then, you know, you may have to wait some time, aconsiderable time in fact, before I return.  So don't injure yourhealth for my sake, if you please."  With that he blew her a kiss, andtrotted away with his tail up.Of course he never came back, though trusting Miss Crocodile waitedpatiently for him; at last she understood what a gay, deceitful fellowhe was, and determined to have her revenge on him one way or another.So she hid herself in the water, under the roots of a tree, close to aford where the Jackal always came to drink.  By and by,  sure enough,he came lilting along in a self-satisfied way, and went right into thewater for a good long draft.  Whereupon Miss Crocodile seized him bythe right legs and held on.  He guessed at once what had happened, andcalled out, "Oh!  my heart's adored!  I'm drowning!  I'm drowning!  Ifyou love me, leave hold of that old root and get a good grip of my leg-it is just next door!"Hearing this, Miss Crocodile thought she must have made a mistake, and,letting go the Jackal's leg in a hurry, seized an old root close by,and held on.  Whereupon Mr. Jackal jumped nimbly to shore, and ran offwith his tail up, calling out, "Have a little patience, my beauty!  Thebarber will come some day!"But this time Miss Crocodile knew better than to wait, and being nowdreadfully angry, she crawled away to the Jackal's hole, and, slippinginside, lay quiet.By and by Mr. Jackal came lilting along with his tail up.  "Ho!  ho!That is your game, is it?" said he to himself, when he saw the trail ofthe Crocodile in the sandy soil.  So he stood outside, and said aloud,"Bless my stars!  What has happened?  I don't half like to go in, forwhenever I come home my wife always calls out,	'Oh, dearest hubby hub!	What have you brought for grub	to me and the darling cub?'and to-day she doesn't say anything!"Hearing this, Miss Crocodile sang out from inside,	"Oh, dearest hubby hub!	What have you brought for grub	To me and the darling cub?"The Jackal winked a very big wink, and, stealing in softly, stood atthe doorway.  Meanwhile Miss Crocodile, hearing him coming, held herbreath, and lay, shamming dead, like a big log."Bless my stars!" cried Mr. Jackal, taking out his pocket handkerchief,"how very sad!  Here's poor Miss Crocodile stone dead, and all for loveof me!  Dear!  dear!  Yet it is very odd, and I don't think she can bequite dead, you know-for dead folks always wag their tails!"On this, Miss Crocodile began to wag her tail very gently, and Mr.Jackal ran off, roaring with laughter, and saying.  "Oho!  oho!  sodead folks always wag their tails!"THE JACKAL AND THE IGUANABy Flora Annie SteelONE moonlight night a miserable, half-starved Jackal, skulking throughthe village, found a worn-out pair of shoes in the gutter.  They weretoo tough for him to eat, so, determined to make some use of them, hestrung them to his ears like earrings, and, going down to the edge ofthe pond, gathered all the old bones he could find together and built aplatform of them, plastering it over with mud.On this he sat in a dignified attitude, and when any animal came to thepond to drink, he cried out in a loud voice, "Hi!  stop!  You must nottaste a drop till you have done homage to me.  So repeat these verseswhich I have composed in honor of the occasion:	'Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!'"Now, as most of the animals were very thirsty, and in a great hurry todrink, they did not care to dispute the matter, but gabbled off thewords without a second thought.  Even the royal tiger, treating it as ajest, repeated the Jackal's rime, in consequence of which the latterbecame quite a cock-a-hoop, and really began to believe he was apersonage of great importance.By and by an Iguana, or big lizard, came waddling down to the water,looking for all the world like a baby alligator."Hi!  you there!" sang out the Jackal; "you mustn't drink until youhave said-	'Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!'""Pouf!  pouf!  pouf!" gasped the Iguana.  "Mercy on us, how dry mythroat is!  Mightn't I have just a wee sip of water first?  and then Icould do justice to your admirable lines; at present I am as hoarse asa crow!""By all means," replied the Jackal, with a gratified smirk.  "I flattermyself the verses are good, especially when well recited."So the Iguana, nose down in the water, drank away until the Jackalbegan to think he would never leave off, and was quite taken aback whenhe finally came to an end of his draft, and began to move away."Hi!  hi!" cried the Jackal, recovering his presence of mind, "stop abit, and say---	'Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!'""Dear me!" replied the Iguana, politely, "I was very near forgetting!Let me see-I must try my Voice first-do, re, me, fa, sol, la, si-thatis right!  Now, how does it run?"	"Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!"repeated the Jackal, not observing that the Lizard Was carefully edgingfarther and farther away."Exactly so," returned the Iguana; "I think I could say that!"Whereupon he sang out at the top of his voice-	"Bones made up his dais, with mud it's plastered o'er,	Old shoes are his eardrops; a jackal, nothing more!"And turning round, he bolted for his hole as hard as he could.The Jackal could scarcely believe his ears, and sat dumb withastonishment.  Then, rage lending him wings, he flew after the Lizard,who, despite his short legs and scanty breath, put his best footforemost, and scuttled away at a great rate.It was a near race, however, for just as he popped into his hole, theJackal caught him by the tail, and held on.  Then it was a case of"pull, butcher; pull, baker," until the Lizard made certain his tailmust come off, and he felt as if his front teeth would come out.  Stillnot an inch did either budge, one way or the other, and there theymight have remained till the present day, had not the Iguana calledout, in his sweetest tones, "Friend, I give in!  Just leave hold of mytail, will you?  then I can turn round and come out."Whereupon the Jackal let go, and the tail disappeared up the hole in atwinkling; while all the reward the Jackal got for digging away untilhis nails were nearly worn out was hearing the Iguana sing softly-	"Bones made up his dais, with mud it's plastered o'er,	Old shoes are his eardrops; a jackal, nothing moreTHE BEAR'S BAD BARGAINBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time a very old Woodman lived with his very old Wife in atiny hut close to the orchard of a very rich man, so close that theboughs of a pear tree hung right over the cottage yard.  Now it wasagreed between the rich man and the Woodman that if any of the fruitfell into the yard, the old couple were to be allowed to eat it; so youmay imagine with what hungry eyes they watched the pears ripening, andprayed for a storm of wind, or a flock of flying foxes, or anythingwhich would cause the fruit to fall.  But nothing came, and the oldWife, who was a grumbling, scolding old thing, declared they wouldinfallibly become beggars.  So she took to giving her husband nothingbut dry bread to eat, and insisted on his working harder than ever,till the poor soul got quite thin; and all because the pears would notfall down!At last the Woodman turned round and declared he would not work moreunless his Wife gave him Khichri for his dinner; so with a very badgrace the old woman took some rice and pulse, some butter and spices,and began to cook a savory Khichri.  What an appetizing smell it had,to be sure!  The Woodman was for gobbling it up as soon as ever it wasready.  "No, no," cried the greedy old Wife, not till you have broughtme in another load of Wood; and mind it is a good one.  You must workfor your dinner."So the old man set off to the forest and began to hack and to hew withsuch a will that he soon had quite a large bundle, and with everyfaggot he cut he seemed to smell the savory Khichri and think of thefeast that was coming.Just then a Bear came swinging by, with its great black nose tilted inthe air, and its little keen eyes peering about; for bears, though goodenough fellows on the whole, are just dreadfully inquisitive."Peace be with you, friend," said the Bear, "and what may you be goingto do with that remarkably large bundle of wood?""It is for my Wife," returned the Woodman.  "The fact is," he addedconfidentially, smacking his lips, "she has made such a Khichri fordinner!  and if I bring in a good bundle of wood she is pretty sure togive me a plentiful portion.  Oh, my dear fellow, you should just smellthat Khichri."At this the Bear's mouth began to water, for, like all bears, he was adreadful glutton."Do you think your Wife would give mite some, too, if I brought her abundle of wood?" he asked anxiously."Perhaps; if it is a very big load," answered the Woodman craftily."Would-would four hundredweight be enough?" asked the Bear."I'm afraid not," returned the 'Woodman, shaking his head; "you seeKhichri is an expensive dish to make-there is rice in it, and plenty ofbutter, and pulse, and-""Would-would eight hundredweight do?""Say half a ton, and it's a bargain!" quoth the Woodman."Half a ton is a large quantity!" sighed the Bear."There is saffron in the Khichri," remarked the Woodman, casually.The Bear licked his lips, and his little eyes twinkled with greed anddelight."Well it's a bargain!  Go home sharp and tell your Wife to keep theKhichri hot; I'll be with you in a trice."Away went the Woodman in great glee to tell his Wife how the Bear hadagreed to bring half a ton of wood in return for a share of theKhichri.Now the wife could not help allowing that her husband had made a goodbargain, but being by nature a grumbler, she was determined not to bepleased, so she began to scold the old man for not having settledexactly the share the Bear was to have.  "For," said she, "he willgobble up the potful before we have finished our first helping."On this the Woodman became quite pale.  "In that case," he said, "wehad better begin now, and have a fair start." So without more ado theysquatted down on the floor, with the brass pot full of Khichri betweenthem, and began to eat as fast as they could."Remember to leave some for the Bear, Wife," said the Woodman, speakingwith his mouth crammed full."Certainly, certainly," she replied, helping herself to anotherhandful."My dear," cried the old woman in her turn, with her mouth so full shecould hardly speak, "remember the poor Bear!""Certainly, certainly, my love!" returned the old man, taking anothermouthful.So it went on, till there was not a single grain left in the pot."What's to be done now?" said the Woodman; "it is all your fault, Wife,for eating so much.""My fault!" retorted his Wife scornfully, "why, you ate twice as muchas I did!""No, I didn't!""Yes, you did! Men always eat more than women."No, they don't!""Yes, they do!""Well, it's no use quarreling about it now," said the Woodman, "theKhichri's gone, and the Bear will be furious.""That wouldn't matter much if we could get the wood," said the greedyold woman.  "I'll tell you what we must do-we must lock up everythingthere is to eat in the house, leave the Khichri pot by the fire, andhide in the garret.  When the Bear comes he will think we have gone outand left his dinner for him.  Then he will throw down his bundle andcome in.  Of course he will rampage a little when he finds the pot isempty, but he can't do much mischief, and I don't think he will takethe trouble of carrying the wood away."So they made haste to lock up all the food and hide themselves in thegarret.Meanwhile the Bear had been toiling and moiling away at his bundle ofwood, which took him much longer to collect than he expected; however,at last he arrived quite exhausted at the woodcutter's cottage.  Seeingthe brass Khichri pot by the fire, he threw down his load and went in.And then-mercy!  wasn't he angry when he found nothing in it-not even agrain of rice, nor a tiny wee bit of pulse, but only a smell that wasso uncommonly nice that he actually cried with rage and disappointment.He flew into the most dreadful temper, but though he turned the housetopsy-turvy, he could not find a morsel of food.  Finally, he declaredhe would take the wood away again, but, as the crafty old woman hadimagined, when he came to the task, he did not care, even for the sakeof revenge, to carry so heavy a burden."I won't go away empty-handed," said he to himself, seizing the Khichripot; "if I can't get the taste I'll have the smell!"Now, as he left the cottage, he caught sight of the beautiful goldenpears hanging over into the yard.  His mouth began to water at once,for he was desperately hungry, and the pears were the best of theseason.  In a trice he was on the wall, up the tree, and gathering thebiggest and ripest one he could find, was just putting it into hismouth when a thought struck him."If I take these pears home I shall be able to sell them for ever somuch to the other bears, and then with the money I shall be able to buysome Khichri.  Ha, ha!  I shall have the best of the bargain afterall!"So saying, he began to gather the ripe pears as fast as he could andput them in the Khichri pot, but whenever he came to an unripe one hewould shake his head and say, "No one would buy that, yet it is a pityto waste it."  So he would pop it into his mouth and eat it, making wryfaces if it was very sour.Now all this time the Woodman's Wife had been watching the Bear througha crevice, and holding her breath for fear of discovery; but, at last,what with being asthmatic, and having a cold in her head, she couldhold it no longer, and just as the Khichri pot was quite full of goldenripe pears, out she came with the most tremendous sneeze you everheard-"A-h-che-u !"The Bear, thinking some one had fired a gun at him, dropped the Khichripot into the cottage yard, and fled into the forest as fast as his legswould carry him.So the Woodrnan and his Wife got the Khichri, the wood, and the covetedpears, but the poor bear got nothing but a very bad stomachache fromeating unripe fruit.THE THIEF AND THE FOXBy Ramaswarni RajuA MAN tied his horse to a tree and went into an inn.  A Thief hid thehorse in a wood, and stood near the tree as if he had not done it."Did you see my horse?" said the man."Yes," said the Thief, "I saw the tree eat up your horse.''"How could the tree eat up my horse?" said the man."Why it did so," said the Thief.The two went to a Fox and told him of the case.  The Fox said.  "I amdull.  All last night the sea was on fire; I had to throw a great dealof hay into it to quench the flames; so come to-morrow, and I shallhear your case."Oh, you lie," said the Thief. "How could the sea burn?  How could hayquench the flames?""Oh, you lie," said the Fox, with a loud laugh; "how could a tree eatup a horse?"The Thief saw his lie had no legs, and gave the man his horse.THE FARMER AND THE FOXBy Ramaswami RajuA FARMER was returning from a fair which he had attended the previousday at a neighboring market town.  He had a quantity of poultry whichhe had purchased.  A Fox observed this, and approaching the Farmer,said, "Good morning, my friend.""What cheer, old fellow?" said the Farmer."I am just coming from the wood, through which you mean to go with yourpoultry.  A band of highwaymen has been tarrying there since daybreak.""Then what shall I do?" said the Farmer."Why," said the Fox, "if I were you I should stay here a while, andafter breakfast enter the wood, for by that time the robbers will haveleft the place.""So be it," said the Farmer, and had a hearty breakfast, with Reynardfor his guest.They kept drinking for a long time.  Reynard appeared to have lost hiswits; he stood up and played the drunkard to perfection.  The Farmer,who highly admired the pranks of his guest, roared with laughter, andgradually fell into a deep slumber.  It was some time after noon whenhe awoke.  To his dismay he found that the Fox was gone, and that thepoultry had all disappeared!"Alas!" said the Farmer, as he trudged on his way home with a heavyheart, "I thought the old rogue was quite drowned in liquor, but I nowsee it was all a pretense.  One must indeed be very sober to play thedrunkard to perfection."THE FOOLS AND THE DRUMBy Ramaswami RajuTWO FOOLS heard a Drum sounding, and said to themselves, There is someone inside it who makes the noise."So, watching a moment, when the drummer was out, they pierced a hole ineach side of it, and pushed their hands in.  Each felt the hand of theother within the Drum, and exclaimed, "I have caught him!"Then one said to the other, "Brother, the fellow seems to be a stubbornknave; come what will, we should not give in.""Not an inch, brother," said the other.So they kept pulling each other's hand, fancying it was the man in theDrum.  The drummer came up, and finding them in such an awkward plightshowed them with his fist who the man in the Drum really was.  But ashis fine Drum was ruined, he said, with a sigh, "Alas!  Fools havefancies with a triple wing!"THE LION AND THE GOATBy Ramaswami RajuA LION was eating up one after another the animals of a certaincountry.  One day an old Goat said, "We must put a stop to this.  Ihave a plan by which he may be sent away from this part of thecountry.""Pray act up to it at once," said the other animals.The old Goat laid himself down in a cave on the roadside, with hisflowing beard and long curved horns.  The Lion, on his way to thevillage, saw him, and stopped at the mouth of the cave."So you have come, after all," said the Goat."What do you mean?" said the Lion."Why, I have long been lying in this cave.  I have eaten up one hundredelephants, a hundred tigers, a thousand wolves, and ninety-nine lions.One more lion has been wanting.  I have waited long and patiently.Heaven has, after all, been kind to me," said the Goat, and shook hishorns and his beard, and made a start as if he were about to springupon the Lion.The latter said to himself, "This animal looks like a Goat, but it doesnot talk like one.  So it is very likely some wicked spirit in thisshape.  Prudence often serves us better than valor, so for the presentI shall return to the wood," and he turned back.The Goat rose up, and, advancing to the mouth of the cave, said, "Willyou come back tomorrow?""Never again," said the Lion."Do you think I shall be able to see you, at least, in the wood to-morrow?""Neither in the wood nor in this neighborhood any more," said the Lion,and running to the forest, soon left it with his kindred.The animals in the country, not hearing him roar any more, gatheredround the Goat, and said, "The wisdom of one doth save a host."THE GLOWWORM AND THE JAC KDAWBy Ramaswami RajuJACKDAW once ran up to a Glowworm and was about to seize him.  "Wait amoment, good friend," said the Worm, "and you shall hear something toyour advantage.""Ah!  what is it?" said the Daw."I am but one of the many glowworms that live in this forest.  If youwish to have them all, follow me," said the Glowworm."Certainly!" said the Daw.Then the Glowworm led him to a place in the wood where a fire had beenkindled by some woodmen, and pointing to the sparks flying about, said,"There you find the glowworms warming themselves round a fire.  Whenyou have done with them I shall show you some more, at a distance fromthis place."The Daw darted at the sparks and tried to swallow some of them, but hismouth being burned by the attempt, he ran away exclaiming, "Ah, theGlowworm is a dangerous little creature!"THE CAMEL AND THE PIGBy Ramaswami RajuA CAMEL said, "Nothing like being tall!  Look how tall I am!"A Pig, who heard these words, said, "Nothing like being short!  Lookhow short I am!"The Camel said, "Well, if I fail to prove the truth of what I said.  Ishall give up my hump."The Pig said, "If I fail to prove the truth of what I have said, Ishall give up my snout.""Agreed!" said the Camel."Just so!" said the Pig.They came to a garden, inclosed by a low wall without any opening.  TheCamel stood on this side of the wall, and reaching the plants within bymeans of his long neck, made a breakfast on them.  Then he turned,jeeringly to the Pig, who had been standing at the bottom of the wall,without even having a look at the good things in the garden, and said,"Now, would you be tall or short?"Next they came to a garden, inclosed by a high wall, with a wicket gateat one end.  The Pig entered by the gate, and, after having eaten hisfill of the vegetables within, came out, laughing at the poor Camel,who had had to stay outside because he was too tall to enter the gardenby the gate, and said, "Now, would you be tall or short?"Then they thought the matter over and came to the conclusion that theCamel should keep his hump and the Pig his snout, observing, "Tall isgood, where tall would do; of short, again, 'tis also true!"THE DOG AND.  THE DOG DEALERBy Ramaswami RajuA DOG was standing by the cottage of a peasant.  A man who dealt indogs passed by the way.  The Dog said, "Will you buy me?"The man said, "Oh, you ugly little thing!  I would not give a quarterof a penny for you!"Then the Dog went to the palace of the king and stood by the portal.The sentinel caressed it, and said, "You are a charming littlecreature!"Just then the Dog Dealer came by.  The Dog said, "Will you buy me?""Oh," said the man, "you guard the palace of the king, who must havepaid a high price for you.  I cannot afford to pay the amount, else Iwould willingly take you.""Ah!" said the Dog, "how place and position affect people!"THE TIGER, THE FOX, AND THE HUNTERSBy Ramaswami RajuA FOX was once caught in a trap.  A hungry Tiger saw him and said, "Soyou are here!""Only on your account," said the Fox in a whisper."How so?" said the Tiger."Why, you were complaining you could not get men to eat, so I got intothis net to-day, that you may have the men when they come to take me,"said the Fox, and gave a hint that if he would wait a while in athicket close by he would point out the men to him."May I depend upon your word?" said the Tiger."Certainly," said the Fox.The Hunters came, and seeing the Fox in the net, said, "So you arehere!""Only on your account," said the Fox, in a whisper."How so?" said the men."Why, you were complaining you could not get at the Tiger that has beendevouring your cattle; I got into this net to-day that you may havehim.  As I expected, he came to eat me up, and is in yonder thicket, "said the Fox, and gave a hint that if they would take him out of thetrap he would point out the Tiger."May we depend upon your word?" said the men."Certainly," said the Fox, while the men went with him in a circle tosee that he did not escape.Then the Fox said to the Tiger and the men, "Sir Tiger, here are themen; gentlemen, here is the Tiger."The men left the Fox and turned to the Tiger.  The former beat a hastyretreat to the wood, saying, "I have kept my promise to both; now youmay settle it between yourselves."The Tiger exclaimed, when it was too late, "Alas!  what art for adouble part!"THE SEA, THE FOX, AND THE WOLFBy Ramaswami RajuA FOX that lived by the seashore once met a 'Wolf that had never seenthe Sea.  The Wolf said, "What is the Sea?""It is a great piece of water by my dwelling," said the Fox."Is it under your control?" said the Wolf."Certainly," said the Fox."Will you show me the Sea, then?" said the Wolf."With pleasure," said the Fox.  So the Fox led the Wolf to the Sea andsaid to the waves, "Now go back"-they went back!  "Now come up"- andthey came up!  Then the Fox said to the waves, "My friend, the Wolf,has come to see you, so you will come up and go back till I bid youstop; and the Wolf saw with wonder the waves coming up and going back.He said to the Fox, "May I go into the Sea?""As far as you like.  Don't be afraid, for at a word, the Sea would goor come as I bid, and as you have already seen."The Wolf believed the Fox, and followed the waves rather far from theshore.  A great wave soon upset him, and threw his carcass on theshore.  The Fox made a hearty breakfast on it.THE FOX IN THE WELLBy Ramaswami RajuA FOX fell into a well and was holding hard to some roots at the sideof it, just above the water.  A Wolf, who was passing by, saw him, andsaid, "Hello, Reynard, after all you have fallen into a well!""But not without a purpose, and not without the means of getting out ofit," said the Fox."What do you mean?" said the Wolf."Why," said the Fox, "there is a drought all over the country now, andthe water in this well is the only means of appeasing the thirst of thethousands that live in this neighborhood.  They held a meeting, andrequested me to keep the water from going down lower; so I am holdingit up for the public good.""What will be your reward?" said the 'Wolf."They will give me a pension, and save me the trouble of going aboutevery day in quest of food, not to speak of innumerable otherprivileges that will be granted me.  Further, I am not to stay here allday.  I have asked a kinsman of mine, to whom I have communicated thesecret of holding up the water, to relieve me from time to time.  Ofcourse he will also get a pension, and have other privileges.  I expecthim here shortly.""Ah, Reynard, may I relieve you, then?  May I hope to get a pension andother privileges?  You know what a sad lot is mine, especially inwinter.""Certainly," said the Fox; "but you must get a long rope, that I maycome up and let you in.So the Wolf got a rope.  Up came the Fox and down went the wo1f, whenthe former observed, with a laugh, "My dear sir, you may remain theretill doomsday, or till the owner of the well throws up your carcass,"and left the place.ASHIEPATTLE AND HIS GOODLY CREWBy P. C. AsbjörnsenONCE upon a time there was a king, and this king had heard about a shipwhich went just as fast by land as by water; and as he wished to haveone like it, he promised his daughter and half the kingdom to anyonewho could build one for him.  And this was given out at every churchall over the country.  There were many who tried, as you can imagine;for they thought it would be a nice thing to have half the kingdom, andthe princess wouldn't be a bad thing into the bargain.  But they allfared badly.Now there were three brothers, who lived far away on the borders of aforest; the eldest was called Peter, the second Paul, and the youngestEspen Ashiepattle, because he always sat in the hearth, raking anddigging in the ashes.It so happened that Ashiepattle was at church on the Sunday when theproclamation about the ship, which the king wanted, was read.  When hecame home amid told his family, Peter, the eldest, asked his mother toget some food ready for him, for now he was going away to try if hecould build the ship and win the princess and half the kingdom.  Whenthe bag was ready lie set out.  On the way he met an old man who wasvery crooked and decrepit."Where are you going?" said the man."I'm going into the forest to make a trough for my father.  He doesn'tlike to eat at table in our company," said Peter."Trough it shall he!" said the man.  "What have you got in that bag ofyours?" he added."Stones," said Peter."Stones it shall be," said the man.  Peter then went into the forestand began to cut and chop away at the trees and work away as hard as hecould, but in spite of all his cutting and chopping he could only turnout troughs.  Toward dinner time he wanted something to eat and openedhis bag.  But there was not a crumb of food in it.  As he had nothingto live upon, and as he did not turn out anything but troughs, hebecame tired of the work, took his ax and bag on his shoulder, and wenthome to his mother.Paul then wanted to set out to try his luck at building the ship andwinning the princess and half the kingdom.  He asked his mother forprovisions, and when the bag was ready he threw it over his shoulderand went on his way to the forest.  On the road he met the old man, whowas very crooked and decrepit."Where are you going?" said the man."Oh, I am going into the forest to make a trough for our sucking pig,"said Paul."Pig trough it shall be," said the man.  "What have you got in that bagof yours?" added the man."Stones," said Paul. "Stones it shall be," said the man.Paul then began felling trees and working away as hard as he could, butno matter how he cut and how he worked he could only turn out pigtroughs.  He did not give in, however, but worked away till far intothe afternoon before he thought of taking any food; then all at once hebecame hungry and opened his bag, but not a crumb could he find.  Paulbecame so angry he turned the bag inside out and struck it against thestump of a tree; then lie took his ax, went out of the forest, and setoff homeward.As soon as Paul returned, Ashiepattle wanted to set out and asked hismother for a bag of food."Perhaps I can manage to build the ship and win the princess and halfthe kingdom," said he."Well, I never heard the like," said his mother.  "Are you likely towin the princess, you, who never do anything but root and dig in theashes?  No, you shan't have any bag with food!"Ashiepattle did not give in, however, but he prayed and begged till hegot leave to go.  He did not get any food, not he; but he stole acouple of oatmeal cakes and some flat beer and set out.When he had walked a while he met the same old man, who was so crookedand tattered and decrepit."'Where are you going?" said the man."Oh, I was going into the forest to try if it were possible to build aship which can go as fast by land as by water," said Ashiepattle, "forthe king has given out that anyone who can build such a ship shall havethe princess and half the kingdom.""What have you got in that bag of yours?" said the man."Not much worth talking about; there ought to be a little food in it,"answered Ashiepattle."If you'll give me a little of it I'll help you, said the man."With all my heart," said Ashiepattle, "but there is nothing but someoatmeal cakes and a drop of flat beer."It didn't matter what it was, the man said; if he only got some of ithe would be sure to help Ashiepattle.When they came up to an old oak in the wood the man said to the lad,"Now you must cut off a chip and then put it back again in exactly thesame place, and when you have done that you can lie down and go tosleep."Ashiepattle did as he was told and then lay down to sleep, and in hissleep lie thought he heard somebody cutting and hammering and sawingand carpentering, but he could not wake up till the man called him;then the ship stood quite finished by the side of the oak."Now you must go on board and everyone you meet you must take withyou," said the man.  Espen Ashiepattle thanked him for the ship, saidhe would do so, and then sailed away.When he had sailed some distance he came to a long, thin tramp, who waslying near some rocks, eating stones."What sort of a fellow are you, that you lie there eating stones?"asked Ashiepattle.  The tramp said he was so fond of meat he couldnever get enough, therefore he was obliged to eat stones.  And then heasked if he might go with him in the ship."If you want to go with us, you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would, but he must take with him some large stones forfood.When they had sailed some distance they met one who was lying on theside of a sunny hill, sucking at a bung."Who are you," said Ashiepattle, "and what is the good of lying theresucking that bung?""Oh, when one hasn't got the barrel, one must be satisfied with thebung," said the man.  "I'm always so thirsty, I can never get enoughbeer and wine."  And then he asked for leave to go with him in theship."If you want to go with me you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would.  And so he went on board and took the bung with himto allay his thirst.When they had sailed a while again they met one who was lying with hisear to the ground, listening."Who are you, and what is the good of lying there on the groundlistening?" said Ashiepattle."I'm listening to the grass, for I have such good ears that I can hearthe grass growing," said the man.  And then he asked leave to go withhim in the ship.  Ashiepattle could not say nay to that, so he said:"If you want to go with me, you must make haste and get on board."Yes, the man would.  And he also went on board.When they had sailed some distance they came to one who was standingtaking aim with a gun."Who are you, and what is the good of standing there aiming like that?"asked Ashiepattle.So the man said: "I have such good eyes that I can hit anything, rightto the end of the world." And then he asked for leave to go with him inthe ship."If you want to go with me, you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would.  And he went on board.When they had sailed some distance again they came to one who washopping and limping about on one leg, and on the other he had seven tonweights."Who are you, said Ashiepattle, "and what is the good of hopping andlimping about on one leg with seven ton weights on the other?""I am so light," said the man, "that if I walked on both my legs Ishould get to the end of the world in less than five minutes." And thenhe asked for leave to go with him in the ship."If you want to go with us, you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would.  And so he joined Ashiepattle and his crew on theship.When they had sailed on some distance they met one who was standingholding his hand to his mouth."Who are you?" said Ashiepattle, "and what is the good of standingthere, holding your mouth like that?""Oh, I have seven summers and fifteen winters in my body," said theman; "so I think I ought to keep my mouth shut, for if they get out allat the same time they would finish off the world altogether."  And thenhe asked for leave to go with him in the ship."If you want to go with us you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would, and then he joined the others on the ship.When they had sailed a long time they came to the king's palace.Ashiepattle went straight in to the king and said the ship stood readyin the courtyard outside; and now he wanted the princess, as the kinghad promised.The king did not like this very much, for Ashiepattle did not cut avery fine figure; he was black and sooty, and the king did not care togive his daughter to such a tramp, so he told Ashiepattle that he wouldhave to wait a little."But you can have her all the same, if by this time to-morrow you canempty my storehouse of three hundred barrels of meat," said the king."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle; "but perhaps you don't mindmy taking one of my crew with me?""Yes, you can do that, and take all six if you like," said the king,for he was quite sure that even if Ashiepattle took six hundred withhim, it would be impossible.  So Ashiepattle took with him the one whoate stones and always hungered after meat.When they came next morning and opened the storehouse they found he hadeaten all the meat, except six small legs of mutton, one for each ofhis companions.  Ashiepattle then went to the king and said thestorehouse was empty, and he supposed he could now have the princess.The king went into the storehouse and, sure enough, it was quite empty;but Ashiepattle was still black and sooty, and the king thought it wasreally too bad that such a tramp should have his daughter.  So he saidhe had a cellar full of beer and old wine, three hundred barrels ofeach kind, which he would have him drink first."I don't mind your having my daughter if you can drink them up by thistime to-morrow," said the king."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle, "but perhaps you don't mindmy taking one of my crew with me?""Yes, you may do that," said the king, for he was quite sure there wastoo much beer and wine even for all seven of them.  Ashiepattle tookwith him the one who was always sucking the bung and was alwaysthirsty; and the king then shut them down in the cellar.There the thirsty one drank barrel after barrel, as long as there wasany left, but in the last barrel he left a couple of pints to each ofhis companions.In the morning the cellar was opened and Ashiepattle went at once tothe king and said he had finished the beer and wine, and now hesupposed he could have the princess as the king had promised."Well, I must first go down to the cellar and see," said the king, forhe could not believe it; but when he got there he found nothing butempty barrels.But Ashiepattle was both black and sooty and the king thought itwouldn't do for him to have such a son in law.  So he said that ifAshiepattle could get water from the end of the world in ten minutesfor the princess's tea, he could have both her and half the kingdom;for he thought that task would be quite impossible."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle, and sent for the one of hiscrew who jumped about on one leg and had seven ton weights on theother, and told him he must take off the weights and use his legs asquickly as he could, for he must have water from the end of the worldfor the princess's tea in ten minutes.So he took off the weights, got a bucket, and set off, and the nextmoment he was out of sight.  But they waited and waited and still hedid not return.  At last it wanted but three minutes to the time andthe king became as pleased as if he had won a big wager.Then Ashiepattle called the one who could hear the grass grow and toldhim to listen and find out what had become of their companion."He has fallen asleep at the well"," said he who could hear the grassgrow; "I can hear him snoring, and a troll is scratching his head."Ashiepattle then called the one who could shoot to the end of the worldand told him to send a bullet into the troll; he did so and hit thetroll right in the eye.  The troll gave such a yell that he woke theman who had come to fetch the water for the tea, and when he returnedto the palace there was still one minute left out of the ten.Ashiepattle went straight to the king and said:  "Here is the water;"and now he supposed he could have the princess, for surely the kingwould not make any more fuss about it now.  But the king thought thatAshiepattle was just as black and sooty as ever, and did not like tohave him for a son-in-law; so he said he had three hundred fathoms ofwood with which he was going to dry corn in the bakehouse, and hewouldn't mind Ashiepattle having his daughter if he would first sit inthe bakehouse and burn all the wood; he should then have the princess,and that without fail."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle; "but perhaps you don't mindmy taking one of my crew with me?""Oh, no, you can take all six," said the king, for he thought it wouldbe warm enough for all of them.Ashiepattle took with him the one who had fifteen winters and sevensummers in his body, and in the evening he went across to thebakehouse: but the king had piled up so much wood on the fire that youmight almost have melted iron in the room.  They could not get out ofit, for no sooner were they inside than the king fastened the bolt andput a couple of padlocks on the door besides.  Ashiepattle then said tohis companion:"You had better let out six or seven winters, so that we may getsomething like summer weather here."They were then just able to exist, but during the night it got coldagain and Ashiepattle then told the man to let out a couple of summers,and so they slept far into the next day.  But when they heard the kingoutside Ashiepattle said:"You must let out a couple more winters, but you must manage it so thatthe last winter you let out strikes the king right in the face."He did so, and when the king opened the door, expecting to findAshiepattle and his companion burned to cinders, he saw them huddlingtogether and shivering with cold till their teeth chattered.  The sameinstant Ashiepattle's companion with the fifteen winters in his bodylet loose the last one right in the king's face, which swelled up intoa big chilblain."Can I have the princess now?" asked Ashiepattle"Yes, take her and keep her and the kingdom into the bargain," said theking, who dared not refuse any longer.  And so the wedding took placeand they feasted and made merry and fired off guns and powder.While the people were running about searching for wadding for theirguns, they took me instead, gave me some porridge in a bottle and somemilk in a basket, and fired me right across here, so that I could tellyou how it all happened.THE SQUIRE'S BRIDEBy P.  C.  AsbjörnsenONCE UPON a time there was a rich squire who owned a large farm, andhad plenty of silver at the bottom of his chest and money in the bankbesides; but he felt there was something wanting, for he was a widower.One day the daughter of a neighboring farmer was working for him in thehayfield.  The squire saw her and liked her very much, and as she wasthe child of poor parents he thought if he only hinted that he wantedher she would be ready to marry him at once.So he told her he had been thinking of getting married again."Aye!  one may think of many things," said the girl, laughing slyly.In her opinion the old fellow ought to be thinking of something thatbehooved him better than getting married."Well, you see, I thought that you should be my wife!""No, thank you all the same," said she, "that's not at all likely."The squire was not accustomed to be gainsaid, and the more she refusedhim the more determined he was to get her.But as he made no progress in her favor he sent for her father and toldhim that if he could arrange the matter with his daughter he wouldforgive him the money he had lent him, and he would also give him thepiece of land which lay close to his meadow into the bargain."Yes, you may be sure I'll bring my daughter to her senses," said thefather.  "She is only a child, and she doesn't know what's best forher."  But all his coaxing and talking did not help matters.  She wouldnot have the squire, she said, if he sat buried in gold up to his ears.The squire waited day after day, but at last he became so angry andimpatient that he told the father, if he expected him to stand by hispromise, he would have to put his foot down and settle the matter now,for he would not wait any longer.The man knew no other way out of it but to let the squire geteverything ready for the wedding; and when the parson and the weddingguests had arrived the squire should send for the girl as if she werewanted for some work on the farm.  When she arrived she would have tobe married right away, so that she would have no time to think it over.The squire thought this was well and good, and so he began brewing andbaking and getting ready for the wedding in grand style.  When theguests had arrived the squire called one of his farm lads and told himto run down to his neighbor and ask him to send him what he hadpromised."But if you are not back in a twinkling," he said, shaking his fist athim, "I'll-"He did not say more, for the lad ran off as if he had been shot at."My master has sent me to ask for that you promised him," said the lad,when he got to the neighbor, "but there is no time to be lost, for heis terribly busy to-day.""Yes, yes!  Run down into the meadow and take her with you.  There shegoes!" answered the neighbor.The lad ran off and when he came to the meadow he found the daughterthere raking the hay."I am to fetch what your father has promised my master," said the lad."Ah, ha!" thought she.  "Is that what they are up to?""Ah, indeed!" she said.  "I suppose it's that little bay mare of ours.You had better go and take her.  She stands there tethered on the otherside of the pea field," said the girl.The boy jumped on the back of the bay mare and rode home at fullgallop."Have you got her with you?" asked the squire."She is down at the door," said the lad."Take her up to the room my mother had," said the squire."But master, how can that be managed?" said the lad."You must just do as I tell you," said the squire.  "If you cannotmanage her alone you must get the men to help you," for he thought thegirl might turn obstreperous.When the lad saw his master's face he knew it would be no use togainsay him.  So he went and got all the farm tenants who were there tohelp him.  Some pulled at the head and the forelegs of the mare andothers pushed from behind, and at last they got her up the stairs andinto the room.  There lay all the wedding finery ready."Now, that's done master!" said the lad; "but it was a terrible job.It was the worst I have ever had here on the farm."Never mind, you shall not have done it for nothing," said his master."Now send the women up to dress her.""But I say master-!" said the lad."None of your talk!" said the squire.  "Tell them they must dress herand mind and not forget either wreath or crown.The lad ran into the kitchen."Look here, lasses," he said; "you must go upstairs and dress up thebay mare as bride.  I expect the master wants to give the guests alaugh."The women dressed the bay mare in everything that was there, and thenthe lad went and told his master that now she was ready dressed, withwreath and crown and all."Very well, bring her down!" said the squire.  "I will receive hermyself at the door," said he.There was a terrible clatter on the stairs; for that bride, you know,had no silken shoes on.When the door was opened and the squire's bride entered the parlor youcan imagine there was a good deal of tittering and grinning.And as for the squire you may he sure line had had enough of thatbride, and they say he never went courting again.THE DOLL IN THE GRASSBy P.  C.  AsbjörnsenONCE upon a time there was a king who had twelve sons.  When they weregrown up he told them they must go out into the world and findthemselves wives, who must all be able to spin and weave and make ashirt in one day, else he would not have them for daughters-in-law.  Hegave each of his sons a horse and a new suit of armor, and so they setout in the world to look for wives.When they had traveled a bit on the way they said they would not takeAshiepattle with them, for he was good for nothing.  Ashiepattle muststop behind; there was no help for it.  He did not know what he shoulddo or which way he should turn; he became so sad that he got off thehorse and sat down on the grass and began to cry.When he had sat a while one of the tussocks among the grass began tomove, and out of it came a small white figure; as it came nearerAshiepattle saw that it was a beautiful little girl, but she was sotiny, so very, very tiny.She went up to him and asked him if he would come below and pay a visitto the doll in the grass.Yes, that he would; and so he did.  When he came down below, the dollin the grass was sitting in a chair dressed very finely and lookingstill more beautiful.  She asked Ashiepattle where he was going andwhat was his errand.He told her they were twelve brothers, and that the king had given themeach a horse and a suit of armor, and told them to go out in the worldand find themselves wives, but they must all be able to spin and weaveand make a shirt in a day."If you can do that and will become my wife, I will not travel anyfarther," said Ashiepattle to the doll in the grass.Yes, that she would, and she set to work at once to get the shirt spun,woven, and made; but it was so tiny, so very, very tiny, no biggerthan-so!Ashiepattle then returned home, taking the shirt with him; but when hebrought it out he felt very shy because it was so small.  But the kingsaid he could have her for all that, and you can imagine how happy andjoyful Ashiepattle became.The road did not seem long to him as he set out to fetch his littlesweetheart.  When he came to the doll in the grass he wanted her to sitwith him on his horse; but no, that she wouldn't; she said she wouldsit and drive in a silver spoon, and she had two small while horseswhich would draw her.  So they set out, he on his horse and she in thesilver spoon; and the horses which drew her were two small white mice.Ashiepattle always kept to one side of the road, for he was so afraidhe should ride over her; she was so very, very tiny.When they had traveled a bit on the way they came to a large lake;there Ashiepattle's horse took fright and shied over to the other sideof the road, and upset the spoon, so that the doll in the grass fellinto the water.  Ashiepattle became very sad, for he did not know howhe should get her out again; but after a while a merman brought her up.But now she had become just as big as any other grown-up being and wasmuch more beautiful than she was before.  So he placed her in front ofhim on the horse and rode home.When Ashiepattle got there all his brothers had also returned, eachwith a sweetheart; but they were so ugly and ill-favored and bad-tempered that they had come to blows with their sweethearts on theirway home.  On their heads they had hats which were painted with tar andsoot, and this had run from their hats down their faces, so that theywere still uglier and more ill-favored to behold.When the brothers saw Ashiepattle's sweetheart they all became enviousof him, but the king was so pleased with Ashiepattle and his sweetheartthat he drove all the others away, and so Ashiepattle was married tothe doll in the grass; and afterward they lived happy and comfortablefor a long, long while; and if they are not dead, they must be stillalive.THE BEAR AND THE FOXBy P.  C.  AsbjörnsenOnce upon a time there was a bear, who sat on a sunny hillside taking anap.  Just then a fox came slinking by and saw him."Aha!  have I caught you napping, grandfather?  See if I don't play youa trick this time!" said Reynard to himself.He then found three wood mice and laid them on a stump of a tree justunder the bear's nose."Boo!  Bruin!  Peter the hunter is just behind that stump!" shouted thefox right into the bear's ear, and then took to his heels and made offinto the wood.The bear woke at once, and when he saw the three mice he became soangry that he lifted his paw and was just going to strike them, for hethought it was they who had shouted in his ear.But just then he saw Reynard's tail between the bushes and he set offat such a speed that the branches crackled under him, and Bruin wassoon so close upon Reynard that he caught him by the right hind legjust as be was running into a hole under a pine tree.Reynard was now in a fix; but he was not to be outwitted, and he cried:"Slip pine root, grip fox foot," and so the bear let go his hold; butthe fox laughed far down in the hole and said:"I sold you that time, also, grandfather!""Out of sight is not out of mind!" said the bear, who was in a finefury.The other morning, when Bruin came trudging across the moor with a fatpig, Master Reynard was lying on a stone by the moorside."Good-day, grandfather!" said the fox.  "What nice thing have you gotthere?""Pork," said the bear."I have got something tasty as well," said the fox."What's that?" said the bear."It's the biggest bees' nest I ever found," said Reynard."Ah, indeed," said the bear, grinning, and his mouth began to water, hethought a little honey would be so nice.  "Shall we change victuals?"he said."No, I won't do that," said Reynard.  But they made a wager aboutnaming three kinds of trees.  If the fox could say them quicker thanthe bear he was to have one bite at the pig; but if the bear could saythem quicker he was to have one suck at the bee's nest.  The bearthought he would be able to suck all the honey up at one gulp."Well said the fox, "that's all well and good but if I win you mustpromise to tear off the bristles where I want to have a bite," he said."Well, I suppose I must, since you are too lazy yourself," said thebear.Then they began to name the trees."Spruce, fir, pine," growled the bear.  His voice was very gruff.  Butall these were only different names of one kind of tree."Ash, aspen, oak," screeched the fox, so that the forest resounded.  Hehad thus won the bet, and so he jumped down, took the heart out of thepig at one bite, and tried to run off.  But the bear was angry, becausehe had taken the best bit of the whole pig, and seized hold of him byhis tail and held him fast."Just wait a bit," said the bear, who was furious."Never mind, grandfather; if you'll let me go you shall have a taste ofmy honey," said the fox.When the bear heard this he let go his hold and the fox jumped up onthe stone after the honey."Over this nest," said Reynard, "I'll put a leaf, and in the leaf thereis a hole, through which you can suck the honey."  He then put the nestright up under the bear's nose, pulled away the leaf, jumped on to thestone, and began grinning and laughing; for there was neither honey norhoneycomb in the nest.  It was a wasp's nest as big as a man's head,full of wasps, and out they swarmed and stung the bear in his eyes andears and on his mouth and snout.  He had so much to do with scratchingthem off him that he had no the to think of Reynard.Ever since the bear has been afraid of wasps.Once the fox and the bear made up their minds to have a field incommon.  They found a small clearing far away in the forest, where theysowed rye the first year."Now we must share and share alike," said Reynard; "if you will havethe roots I will have the tops," he said.Yes, Bruin was quite willing; but when they had thrashed the crop thefox got all the corn, while the bear got nothing but the roots andtares.Bruin didn't like this, but the fox said it was only as they hadagreed."This year I am the gainer," said the fox; "another year it will beyour turn; you can then have the tops and I will be satisfied with theroots."Next spring the fox asked the bear if he didn't think turnips would bethe right thing for that year."Yes, that's better food than corn," said the bear; and the fox thoughtthe same.When the autumn came the fox took the turnips, but the bear only gotthe tops.The bear then became so angry that he parted company then and therewith Reynard.One day the bear was lying eating a horse which he had killed.  Reynardwas about again and came slinking along, his mouth watering for a tastybit of the horseflesh.He sneaked in and out and round about till he came up behind the bear,when he made a spring to the other side of the carcass, snatching apiece as he jumped across.The bear was not slow either; he made a dash after Reynard and caughtthe tip of his red tail in his paw.  Since that time the fox has alwayshad a white tip to his tail."Wait a bit Reynard, and come here," said the bear, "and I'll teach youhow to catch horses."Yes, Reynard was quite willing to learn that, but he didn't trusthimself too near the bear."When you see a horse lying asleep in a sunny place," said the bear,"you must tie yourself fast with the hair of his tail to your brush,and then fasten your teeth in his thigh," he said.Before long the fox found a horse lying asleep on a sunny hillside; andso he did as the bear had told him; he knotted and tied himself well tothe horse with the hair of the tail and then fastened his teeth intohis thigh.Up jumped the horse and began to kick and gallop so that Reynard wasdashed against stock and stone, and was so bruised and battered that henearly lost his senses.All at once a hare rushed by.  "Where are you off to in such a hurry,Reynard?" said the hare."I'm having a ride, Bunny!" said the fox.The hare sat up on his hind legs and laughed till the sides of hismouth split right up to his ears, at the thought of Reynard having sucha grand ride; but since then the fox has never thought of catchinghorses again.That time it was Bruin who for once had the better of Reynard;otherwise they say the bear is as simple-minded as the trolls.THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WINDBy Sir George Webbe DasentOnce upon a time there was an old widow who had one son, and she waspoorly and weak, her son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal forcooking; but when he got outside the safe, and was just going down thesteps, there came the North Wind, puffing and blowing, caught up themeal, and so away with it through the air.  Then the lad went back intothe safe for more; but when he came out again on the steps, if theNorth Wind didn't come again and carry off the meal with a puff; andmore than that, he did so the third time.  At this the lad got veryangry; and as he thought it hard that the North Wind should behave so,he thought he'd just look him up and ask him to give up his meal.So off he went, but the way was long, and he walked and walked; but atlast he came to the North Wind's house."Good day!" said the lad, and "thank you for coming to see usyesterday.""GOOD DAY!" answered the North Wind, for his voice was loud and gruff,"AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME.  WHAT DO YOU WANT?""Oh!" answered the lad, "I only wished to ask you to be so good as tolet me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps, for wehaven't much to live on; and if you're to go on snapping up the morselwe have there'll be nothing for it but to starve.""I haven't got your meal," said the North Wind; "but if you are in suchneed, I'll give you a cloth which will get you everything you want, ifyou only say, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of gooddishes!'"With this the lad was well content.  But, as the way was so long hecouldn't get home in one day, he stopped at an inn on the way; and whenthey were going to sit down to supper, he laid the cloth on a tablewhich stood in the corner and said:"Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid; and all whostood by thought it a fine thing, but most of all the landlady.  So,when all were fast asleep, at dead of night, she took the lad's cloth,and put another in its stead, just like the one he had got from theNorth Wind, but which couldn't so much as serve up a bit of dry bread.So when the lad awoke, he took his cloth and went off with it, and thatday he got home to his mother."Now," said he, "I've been to the North Wind's house, and a good fellowhe is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, 'Cloth,spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes,' I get any sortof food I please.""All very true, I dare say," said his mother, "but seeing is believing,and I shan't believe it till I see it."So the lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, andsaid- "Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve"Well," said the lad, "there's no help for it but to go to the NorthWind again;" and away he went.So late in the afternoon he came to where the North Wind lived."Good evening!" said the lad."Good evening!" said the North Wind.  "I want my rights for that mealof ours which you took," said the lad; "for, as for that cloth I got,it isn't worth a penny.""I've got no meal," said the North Wind; "but yonder you have a ramwhich coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it-"'Ram, ram!  Make money!'"So the lad thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get homethat day, he stopped for the night at the same inn where he had sleptbefore.Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the NorthWind had said of the ram, and found it all right; but when the landlordsaw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when the lad had fallenasleep, he took another which couldn't coin gold ducats, and changedthe two.Next morning off went the lad; and when he got home to his mother, hesaid-"After all, the North Wind is a jolly fellow; for now he has givenme a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say, 'Ram, ram!  Makemoney!'""All very true, I dare say," said his mother; "but I shan't believe anysuch stuff until I see the ducats made.""Ram, ram!  Make money!" said the lad; but the ram made no money.So the lad went back again to the North Wind, and blew him up, and saidthe ram was worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal."Well," said the North Wind, "I've nothing else to give you but thatold stick in the corner yonder; but it's a stick of that kind that ifyou say- 'Stick, stick!  lay on!' it lays on till you say, 'Stick,stick!  now stop!'So, as the way was long the lad turned in this night, too, to thelandlord; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to thecloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore,as if he were asleep.Now the landlord, who easily saw that the stick must be worthsomething, hunted up one which was like it, and when he heard the ladsnore, was going to change the two, but just as the landlord was aboutto take it, the lad bawled out- "Stick, stick!  lay on!"So the stick began to beat the landlord till he jumped over chairs, andtables, and benches, and yelled and roared,- "Oh my!  oh my!  bid thestick be still, else it will beat me to death, and you shall have backyour cloth and your ram,When the lad thought the landlord had got enough, he said- "Stick,stick!  now stop!"Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket, and went home withhis stick in his hand, leading the ram by a cord round its horns; andso he got his rights for the meal he had lost.THE HUSBAND WHO WAS TO MIND THE HOUSEBy Sir George Webbe DasentONCE upon a time there was a man, so surly and cross, he never thoughthis wife did anything right in the house.  So one evening in haymakingtime, he came home, scolding and swearing, and showing his teeth andmaking a dust."Dear love, don't be so angry; there's a good man," said his goody;"to-morrow let's change our work.  I'll go out with the mowers and mow,and you shall mind the house at home."Yes, the husband thought that would do very well.  He was quitewilling, he said.So early next morning his goody took a scythe over her neck, and wentout into the hayfield with the mowers and began to mow; but the man wasto mind the house, and do the work at home.First of all he wanted to churn the butter; but when he had churned awhile, he got thirsty, and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel ofale.  So, just when he had knocked in the bung, and was putting the tapinto the cask, he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen.  Thenoff he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, as fast as hecould, to look after the pig, lest it should upset the churn; but whenhe got up, and saw that the pig had already knocked the churn over, andstood there, routing and grunting amid the cream which was running allover the floor, he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot his alebarrel and ran at the pig as hard as he could.  He caught it, too, justas it ran out of doors, and gave it such a kick that piggy lay for deadon the spot.  Then all at once he remembered he had the tap in hishand, but when he got down to the cellar, every drop of ale had run outof the cask.Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill thechurn again, and so he began to churn, for butter they must have fordinner.  When he had churned a bit, he remembered that their milkingcow was still shut up in the brye, and hadn't had a bit to eat or adrop to drink all the morning, though the sun was high.  Then all atonce he thought 'twas too far to take her down to the meadow, so he'djust get her up on the housetop-for the house, you must know, wasthatched with sods, and a fine crop of grass was growing there.Now their house lay close up against a steep down, and he thought if helaid a plank across to the thatch at the back he'd easily get the cowup.But still he couldn't leave the churn, for there was his little babecrawling about the floor, and "if I leave it," he thought, "the childis sure to upset it!"  So he took the churn on his back, and went outwith it; but then he thought he'd better first water the cow before heturned her out on the thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw water outof the well; but, as he stooped down at the well's brink, all the creamran out of the churn over his shoulders, and so down into the well.Now it was near dinner time, and he hadn't even got the butter yet; sohe thought he'd best boil the porridge, and filled the pot with water,and hung it over the fire.  When he had done that, he thought the cowmight perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck.  Sohe got up on the house to tie her up.  One end of the rope he made fastto the cow's neck, and the other he slipped down the chimney and tiedround his own thigh; and he had to make haste, for the water now beganto boil in the pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal.So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at it, down fell thecow off the housetop after all, and as she fell, she dragged the man upthe chimney by the rope.  There he stuck fast; and as for the cow, shehung halfway down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth, for shecould neither get down nor up.And now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for herhusband to come and call them home to dinner; but never a call theyhad.  At last she thought she'd waited long enough, and went home.  Butwhen she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place, sheran up and cut the rope in two with her scythe.  But as she did this,down came her husband out of the chimney; and so when his old dame cameinside the kitchen, there she found him standing on his head in theporridge pot.HOW ONE WENT OUT TO WOOBy Sir George Webbe DasentO NCE upon a time there was a lad who went out to woo him a wife.Among other places he came to a farmhouse, where the household werelittle better than beggars; but when the wooer came in they wanted tomake out that they were well to do, as you may guess.  Now the husbandhad got a new arm to his coat."Pray, take a seat," he said to the wooer; "but there's a shocking dustin the house."So he went about rubbing and wiping all the benches and tables with hisnew arm, but he kept the other all the while behind his back.The wife she had got one new shoe, and she went stamping and slidingwith it up against the stools and chairs saying, "How untidy it ishere!  Everything is out of place!"Then they called out to their daughter to come down and put things torights; but the daughter she had got a new cap; so she put her head inat the door, and kept nodding and nodding, first to this side and thento that."Well!  For my part, She said, I can't be everywhere at once."Aye!  Aye! That was a well-to-do household the wooer had come to.WHY THE BEAR IS STUMPY-TAILEDBy Sir George Webbe DasentONE day the Bear met the Fox, who came slinking along with a string offish he had stolen."Whence did you get these from?" asked the Bear."Oh! My Lord Bruin, I've been out fishing and caught them," said theFox.So the Bear had a mind to learn to fish too, and bade the Fox tell himhow he was to set about it."Oh! It's an easy craft for you", answered the Fox, "and soon learned.You've only got to go upon the ice, and cut a hole and stick your taildown into it; and so you must go on holding it there as long as youcan.  You're not to mind if your tail smarts a little; that's when thefish bite.  The longer you hold it there the more fish you'll get; andthen all at once out with it, with a cross pull sideways, and with astrong pull too."Yes; the Bear did as the Fox had said, and held his tail a long, longthe down in the hole, till it was fast frozen in.  Then he pulled itout with a cross pull, and it snapped short off.  That's why Bruin goesabout with a stumpy tail this very day.BOOTS WHO MADE THE PRINCESS SAY "THAT'S A STORY"By Sir George Webbe DasentONCE upon a time there was a King who had a daughter, and she was sucha dreadful storyteller that the like of her was not to be found far ornear.  So the King gave out, that if anyone could tell such a string oflies as would get her to say, "That's a story," he should have her towife, and half the kingdom besides.  Well, many came, as you may fancy,to try their luck, for everyone would have been very glad to have thePrincess, to say nothing of the kingdom; but they all cut a sorryfigure, for the Princess was so given to storytelling, that all theirlies went in at one ear and out of the other.  Among the rest camethree brothers to try their luck, and the two elder went first, butthey fared no better than those that had gone before them.  Last ofall, the third, Boots, set off and found the Princess in the farmyard."Good morning," he said, "and thank you for nothing."  "Good morning,"said she, "and the same to you."  Then she went on-"You haven't such a fine farmyard as ours, I'll be bound; for when twoshepherds stand, one at each end of it, and blow their ram's horns, theone can't hear the other.""Haven't we though!" answered Boots; "ours is far bigger; for when acalf starts to cross a field, it is a full-grown cow when it reachesthe other end.""I dare say," said the Princess.  "Well, but you haven't such a big ox,after all, as ours yonder; for when two men sit, one on each horn, theycan't touch each other with a tweny-foot rule.""Stuff!" said Boots; "is that all?  Why, we have an ox who is so big,that when two men sit, one on each horn, and each blows his greatmountain-trumpet, they can't hear one another.""I dare say," said the Princess; "but you haven't so much milk as we,I'll be bound; for we milk our cows into great pails, and carry themindoors, and empty them into great tubs, and so we make great, greatcheeses.""Oh!  you do, do you?" said Boots.  "Well, we milk ours into greattubs, and then we put them in carts and drive them indoors, and then weturn them out into great brewing vats, and so we make cheeses as big asa great house.  We had, too, a dun mare to tread the cheese welltogether when it was making; but once she tumbled down into the cheese,and we lost her; and after we had eaten at this cheese seven years, wecame upon a great dun mare, alive and kicking.  Well, once after that Iwas going to drive this mare to the mill, and her backbone snapped intwo; but I wasn't put out, not I; for I took a spruce sapling, and putit into her for a backbone, and she had no other backbone all the whilewe had her.  But the sapling grew up into such a tall tree, that Iclimbed right up to the sky by it, and when I got there I saw a ladysitting and spinning the foam of the sea into pigs'-bristle ropes; butjust then the spruce-fir broke short off, and I couldn't get downagain; so the lady let me down by one of the ropes, and down I slippedstraight into a fox's hole, and who should sit there but my mother andyour father cobbling shoes; and just as I stepped in, my mother gaveyour father such a box on the ear that it made his whiskers curl.""That's a story!" said the Princess, "my father never did any suchthing in all his born days!"So Boots got the Princess to wife, and half the kingdom besides.THE WITCH IN THE STONE BOATRetold by Andrew LangTHERE was once a king and queen, and they had a son called Sigurd, whowas very strong and active and good-looking.  When the king came to bebowed down with the weight of years he spoke to his son, and said thatnow it was time for him to look out for a fitting match for himself,for he did not know how long he might last now, and he would like tosee him married before he died.Sigurd was not averse to this and asked his father where he thought itbest to look for a wife.  The king answered that in a certain countrythere was a king who had a beautiful daughter, and he thought it wouldbe most desirable if Sigurd could get her.  So the two parted, andSigurd prepared for the journey and went to where his father haddirected him.He came to the king and asked his daughters hand, which was readilygranted him, but only on the condition that he should remain there aslong as he could, for the king himself was not strong and not very ableto govern his kingdom.  Sigurd accepted this condition, but added thathe would have to get leave to go home again to his own country when heheard news of his father's death.  After that Sigurd married theprincess and helped his father-in-law to govern the kingdom.  He andthe princess loved each other dearly, and after a year a son came tothem, who was two years old when word came to Sigurd that his fatherwas dead.  Sigurd now prepared to return home with his wife and childand went on board ship to go by sea.They had sailed for several days, when the breeze suddenly fell andthere came a dead calm at a time when they needed only one day's voyageto reach home.  Sigurd and his queen were one day on deck when most ofthe others on the ship had fallen asleep.  There they sat and talkedfor a while, and had their little son along with them.  After a timeSigurd became so heavy with sleep that he could no longer keep awake,so he went below and lay down, leaving the queen alone on the deckplaying with her son.A good while after Sigurd had gone below the queen saw something blackon the sea which seemed to be coming nearer.  As it approached shecould make out that it was a boat and could see the figure of some onesitting in it and rowing it.  At last the boat came alongside the ship,and now the queen saw that it was a stone boat, out of which there cameon board the ship a fearfully ugly witch.  The queen was morefrightened than words can describe, and could neither speak a word normove from the place so as to awaken the king or the sailors.  The witchcame right up to the queen, took the child from her, and laid it on thedeck; then she took the queen and stripped her of all her fine clothes,which she proceeded to put on herself and looked then like a humanbeing.  Last of all she took the queen, put her into the boat and said:"This spell I lay upon you, that you slacken not your course until youcome to my brother in the under world."The queen sat stunned and motionless, but the boat at once shot awayfrom the ship with her, and before long she was out of sight.When the boat could no longer be seen the child began to cry, andthough the witch tried to quiet it she could not manage it; so, withthe child on her arm, she went below to where the king was sleeping,and awakened him, scolding him for leaving them alone on deck while heand all the crew were asleep.  It was great carelessness of him, shesaid, to leave no one to watch the ship with her.Sigurd was greatly surprised to hear his queen scold him so much, forshe had never said an angry word to him before; but he thought it wasquite excusable in this case, and tried to quiet the child along withher but it was no use.  Then he went and wakened the sailors and badethem hoist the sails, for a breeze had sprung up and was blowingstraight toward the harbor.They soon reached the land which Sigurd was to rule over, and found allthe people sorrowful for the old king's death, but they became gladwhen they got Sigurd back to the court, and made him king over them.The king's son, however, hardly ever stopped crying from the time hehad been taken from his mother on the deck of the ship, although he hadalways been such a good child before, so that at last the king had toget a nurse for him-one of the maids of the court.  As soon as thechild got into her charge he stopped crying and behaved as well asbefore.After the sea voyage it seemed to the king that the queen had alteredvery much in many ways, and not for the better.  He thought her muchmore haughty and stubborn and difficult to deal with than she used tobe.  Before long others began to notice this as well as the king.  Inthe court there were two young fellows, one of eighteen years old, theother of nineteen, who were very fond of playing chess and often satlong inside playing at it.  Their room was next the queen's, and oftenduring the day they heard the queen talking.One day they paid more attention than usual when they heard her talk,and put their ears close to a crack in the wall between the rooms, andheard the queen say quite plainly: 'When I yawn a little, then I am anice little maiden: when I yawn halfway, then I am half a troll; andwhen I yawn fully then I am a troll altogether."As she said this she yawned tremendously, and in a moment had put onthe appearance of a fearfully ugly troll.  Then there came up throughthe floor of the room a three-headed giant with a trough full of meat,who saluted her as his sister and set down the trough before her.  Shebegan to eat out of it and never stopped till she had finished it.  Theyoung fellows saw all this going on, but did not hear the two of themsay anything to each other.  They were astonished, though, at howgreedily the queen devoured the meat and how much she ate of it, andwere no longer surprised that she took so little when she sat at tablewith the king.  As soon as she had finished it the giant disappearedwith the trough by the same way as he had come, and the queen returnedto her human shape.Now we must go back to the king's son after he had been put in chargeof the nurse.  One evening. after she had lit a candle and was holdingthe child, several planks sprang up in the floor of the room, and outat the opening came a beautiful woman dressed in white, with an ironbelt round her waist, to which was fastened an iron chain that wentdown into the ground.  The woman came up to the nurse, took the childfrom her, and pressed it to her breast; then she gave it back to thenurse and returned by the same way as she had come, and the floorclosed over her again.  Although the woman had not spoken a single wordto her, the nurse was very much frightened, but told no one about it.Next evening the same thing happened again, just as before, but as thewoman was going away she said in a sad tone, "Two are gone and one onlyis left," and then disappeared as before.  The nurse was still morefrightened when she heard the woman say this, and thought that perhapssome danger was hanging over the child, though she had no ill opinionof the unknown woman, who, indeed, had behaved toward the child as ifit were her own.  The most mysterious thing was the woman saying "andonly one is left"; but the nurse guessed that this must mean that onlyone day was left, since she had come for two days already.At last the nurse made up her mind to go to the king.  She told him thewhole story and asked him to be present in person the next day aboutthe time when the woman usually came.  The king promised to do so, andcame to the nurse's room a little before the time and sat down on achair with his drawn sword in his hand.  Soon after the planks in thefloor sprang up as before, and the woman came up, dressed in white,with the iron belt and chain.  The king saw at once that it was his ownqueen, and immediately hewed asunder the iron chain that was fastenedto the belt.  This was followed by such noises and crashings down inthe earth that all the king's palace shook, so that no one expectedanything else than to see every bit of it shaken to pieces.  At lastthe noises and shaking stopped, and they began to come to themselvesagain.The king and queen embraced each other, and she told him the wholestory-how the witch came to the ship when they were all asleep and senther off in the boat.  After she had gone so far that she could not seethe ship, she sailed on through darkness until she landed beside athree-headed giant.  The giant wished her to marry him, but sherefused; whereupon he shut her up by herself and told her she wouldnever get free until she consented.  After a time she began to plan howto get her freedom, and at last told him that she would consent if hewould allow her to visit her son on earth three days on end.  This heagreed to, but put on her this iron belt and chain, the other end ofwhich he fastened around his, own waist, and the great noises that wereheard when the king cut the chain must have been caused by the giant'sfalling down the underground passage when the chain gave way sosuddenly.  The giant's dwelling, indeed, was right under the palace,and the terrible shakings must have been caused by him in his deaththroes.The king now understood how the queen he had had for some time past hadbeen so ill-tempered.  He at once had a sack drawn over her head andmade her be stoned to death, and after that torn in pieces by untamedhorses.  The two young fellows also told now what they had heard andseen in the queen's room, for before this they had been afraid to sayanything about it, on account of the Queen's power.The real queen was now restored to all her dignity and was beloved byall.  The nurse was married to a nobleman and the king and queen gaveher splendid presents.THE SNUFFIBOXBy Paul SébillotAs often happens in this world, there was once a young man who spentall his time in traveling.  One day, as he was walking along, he pickedup a snuffbox.  He opened it, and the snuffbox said to him in theSpanish language:  "What do you want?"  He was very much frightened,but, luckily, instead of throwing the box away he only shut it tightand put it in his pocket.  Then he went on, away, away, away, and as hewent he said to himself, "if it says to me again, 'What do you want?' Ishall know better what to say this time."  So he took out the snuffboxand opened it, and again it asked: "What do you want?"  "My hat full ofgold," answered the youth, and immediately it was full.Our young man was enchanted.  Henceforth he should never be in need ofanything.  So on he traveled, away, away, away, through thick forests,till at last he came to a beautiful castle.  In the castle there liveda king.  The young man walked round and round the castle, not caringwho saw him, till the king noticed him and asked what he was doingthere.  "I was just looking at your castle."  "You would like to haveone like it, wouldn't you?"  The young man did not reply, but when itgrew dark he took out his snuffbox and opened the lid."  What do youwant?"  "Build me a castle with laths of gold and tiles of diamond andthe furniture all of silver and gold."  He had scarcely finishedspeaking when there stood in front of him, exactly opposite the king'spalace, a castle built precisely as he had ordered.  When the kingawoke he was struck dumb at the sight of the magnificent house shiningin the rays of the sun.  The servants could not do their work forstopping to stare at it.  Then the king dressed himself and went to seethe young man.  And he told him plainly that he was a very powerfulprince, and that he hoped that they might all live together in onehouse or the other, and that the king would give him his daughter towife.  So it all turned out just as the king wished.  The young manmarried the princess and they lived happily in the palace of gold.But the king's wife was jealous both of the young man and of her owndaughter.  The princess had told her mother about the snuffbox, whichgave them everything they wanted, and the queen bribed a servant tosteal the snuffbox.  They noticed carefully where it was put away everynight, and one evening, when the whole world was asleep, the womanstole it and brought it to her old mistress.  Oh, how happy the queenwas!  She opened the lid and the snuffbox said to her: "What do youwant?"  And she answered at once: "I want you to take me and my husbandand my servants and this beautiful house and set us down on the otherside of the Red Sea, but my daughter and her husband are to staybehind."When the young couple woke up they found themselves back in the oldcastle, without their snuffbox.  They hunted for it high and low, butquite vainly.  The young man felt that no time was to be lost, and hemounted his horse and filled his pockets with as much gold as he couldcarry.  On he went, away, away, away, but he sought the snuffbox invain all up and down the neighboring countries, and very soon he cameto the end of all his money.  But still he went on, as fast as thestrength of his horse would let him, begging his way.Some one told him that he ought to consult the moon, for the moontraveled far and might be able to tell him something.  So he went away,away, away, and ended, somehow or other, by reaching the land of themoon.  There he found a little old woman who said to him: "What are youdoing here?  My son eats all living things he sees, and if you are wiseyou will go away without coming any farther."  But the young man toldher all his sad tale, and how he possessed a wonderful snuffbox, andhow it had been stolen from him, and how he had nothing left now thathe was parted from his wife and was in need of everything.  And he saidthat perhaps her son, who traveled so far, might have seen a palacewith laths of gold and tiles of diamond and furnished all in silver andgold.  As he spoke these last words the moon came in and said hesmelled mortal flesh and blood.  But his mother told him that it was anunhappy man who had lost everything and had come all this way toconsult him, and bade the young man not to be afraid, but to comeforward and show himself.  So he went boldly up to the moon, and askedif by any accident he had seen a palace with the laths of gold and thetiles of diamond and all the furniture of silver and gold.  Once thishouse belonged to him, but now it was stolen.  And the moon said no,but that the sun traveled farther than he did, and that the young manhad better go and ask him.So the young man departed and went away, away, away, as well as hishorse would take him, begging his living as he rode along, and somehowor other at last he got to the land of the sun.  There he found alittle old woman, who asked him:  "What are you doing here?  Go away.Have you not heard that my son feeds upon Christians?"  But he said noand that he would not go, for he was so miserable that it was all oneto him whether he died or not; that he had lost everything, andespecially a splendid palace like none other in the whole world, for ithad laths of gold and tiles of diamond and all the furniture was ofsilver and gold; and that he had sought it far and long, and in all theearth there was no man more unhappy.  So the old woman's heart meltedand she agreed to hide him.When the sun arrived he declared that he smelled Christian flesh and hemeant to have it for his dinner.  But his mother told him such apitiful story of the miserable wretch who had lost everything and hadcome from far to ask his help that at last he promised to see him.So the young man came out from his hiding-place and begged the sun totell him if in the course of his travels he had not seen somewhere apalace that had not its like in the whole world, for its laths were ofgold and its tiles of diamond and all the furniture in silver and gold.And the sun said no, but that perhaps the wind had seen it, for heentered everywhere and saw things that no one else ever saw, and ifanyone knew where it was it was certainly the wind.Then the poor young man again set forth as well as his horse could takehim, begging his living as he went, and somehow or other he ended byreaching the home of the wind.  He found there a little old womanbusily occupied in filling great barrels with water.  She asked himwhat had put it into his head to come there, for her son ate everythinghe saw, and that he would shortly arrive quite mad, and that the youngman had better look out.  But he answered that he was so unhappy thathe had ceased to mind anything, even being eaten, and then he told herthat he had been robbed of a palace that had not its equal in all theworld, and of all that was in it, and that he had even left his wifeand was wandering over the world until he found it.  And that it wasthe sun who had sent him to consult the wind.  So she hid him under thestaircase, and soon they heard the south wind arrive, shaking the houseto its foundations.  Thirsty as he was, he did not wait to drink, buthe told his mother that he smelled the blood of a Christian man, andthat she had better bring him out at once and make him ready to beeaten.  But she bade her son eat and drink what was before him, andsaid that the poor young man was much to be pitied, and that the sunhad granted him his life in order that he might consult the Wind.  Thenshe brought out the young man, who explained how he was seeking for hispalace, and that no man had been able to tell him where it was, so hehad come to the Wind.  And he added that he had been shamefully robbed,and that the laths were of gold and the tiles of diamond, and all thefurniture in silver and gold, and he inquired if the Wind had not seensuch a palace during his wanderings.And the Wind said yes, and that all that day he had been blowingbackward and forward over it without being able to move one singletile.  "Oh, do tell me where it is," cried the young man."  "It is along way off," replied the Wind, "on the other side of the Red Sea."But our traveler was not discouraged-he had already journeyed too far.So he set forth at once, and somehow or other he managed to reach thatdistant land.  And he inquired if any one wanted a gardener.  He wastold that the head gardener at the castle had just left, and perhaps hemight have a chance of getting the place.  The young man lost no time,but walked up to the castle and asked if they were in want of agardener; and how happy he was when they agreed to take him!  Now hepassed most of his day in gossiping with the servants about the wealthof their masters and the wonderful things in the house.  He madefriends with one of the maids, who told him the history of thesnuffbox, and he coaxed her to let him see it.  One evening she managedto get hold of it, and the young man watched carefully where she hid itaway in a secret place in the bedchamber of her mistress.The following night, when everyone was fast asleep, he crept in andtook the snuffbox.  Think of his joy as he opened the lid!  When itasked him, as of yore, "What do you want?"  he replied: "What do Iwant?  What do I want?  Why, I want to go with my palace to the oldplace, and for the king and the queen and all their servants to bedrowned in the Red Sea."He had hardly finished speaking when he found himself back again withhis wife, while all the other inhabitants of the palace were lying atthe bottom of the Red Sea.THE GOLDEN BLACKBIRDBy Paul SébillotONCE upon a time there was a great lord who had three sons.  He fellvery ill, sent for doctors of every kind, even bonesetters, but theynone of them could find out what was the matter with him or even givehim any relief.  At last there came a foreign doctor, who declared thatthe golden blackbird alone could cure the sick man.So the old lord dispatched his eldest son to look for the wonderfulbird, and promised him great riches if he managed to find it and bringit back.The young man began his journey and soon arrived at a place where fourroads met.  He did not know which to choose, and tossed his cap in theair, determining that the direction of its fall should decide him.After traveling for two or three days he grew tired of walking withoutknowing where or for how long, and .he stopped at an inn which wasfilled with merrymakers and ordered something to eat and drink."My faith," said he, "it is sheer folly to waste more time hunting forthis bird.  My father is old, and if he dies I shall inherit hisgoods."The old man, after waiting patiently for some time, sent his second sonto seek the golden blackbird.  The youth took the same direction as hisbrother, and when he came to the crossroads he too tossed up which roadhe should take.  The cap fell in the same place as before, and hewalked on till he came to the spot where his brother had halted.  Thelatter, who was leaning out of the window of the inn, called to him tostay where he was and amuse himself."You are right," replied the youth.  "Who knows if I should ever findthe golden blackbird, even if I sought the whole world through for it?At the worst, if the old man dies we shall have his property."He entered the inn and the two brothers made merry and feasted, tillvery soon their money was all spent.  They even owed something to theirlandlord, who kept them as hostages till they could pay their debts.The youngest son set forth in his turn, and he arrived at the placewhere his brothers where still prisoners.  They called to him to stopand did all they could to prevent his going further."No," he replied, "my father trusted me, and I will go all over theworld till I find the golden blackbird.""Bah," said his brothers, "you will never succeed any better than wedid.  Let him die if he wants to.  We will divide the property."As he went his way he met a little hare, who stopped to looked at himand asked:"Where are you going, my friend ?""I really don't quite know," answered he.  "My father is ill, and hecannot be cured unless I bring him back the golden blackbird.  It is along time since I set out, but no one can tell me where to find it.""Ah," said the hare, "you have a long way to go yet.  You will have towalk at least seven hundred miles before you get to it.""And how am I to travel such a distance?""Mount on my back," said the little hare, "and I will conduct you."The young man obeyed.  At each bound the little hare went seven miles,and it was not long before they reached a castle that was as large andbeautiful as a castle could be."The golden blackbird is in a little cabin near by," said the littlehare, "and you will easily find it.  It lives in a little cage, withanother cage beside it made all of gold.  But whatever you do, be surenot to put it in the beautiful cage, or everybody in the castle willknow that you have stolen it."The youth found the golden blackbird standing on a wooden perch, but asstiff and rigid as if he was dead.  And beside, was the beautiful cage,the cage of gold."Perhaps he would revive if I were to put him in that lovely cage,"thought the youth.The moment the golden blackbird had touched the bars of the splendidcage he awoke and began to whistle, so that all the servants of thecastle ran to see what was the matter, saying that he was a thief andmust be put in prison."No," he answered, "I am not a thief.  If I have taken the goldenblackbird, it is only that it may cure my father, who is ill, and Ihave traveled more than seven hundred miles in order to find it.""Well," they replied, "we will let you go, and will even give you thegolden blackbird if you are able to bring us the porcelain maiden."The youth departed, weeping, and met the little hare, who was munchingwild thyme."What are you crying for, my friend?"  asked the hare."It is because," he answered, "the castle people will not allow me tocarry off the golden blackbird without giving them the porcelain maidenin exchange.""You have not followed my advice," said the little hare.  "And you haveput the golden blackbird into the fine cage.""Alas!  yes!""Don't despair.  The porcelain maiden is a young girl, beautiful asVenus, who dwells two hundred miles from here.  Jump on my back and Iwill take you there."The little hare, who took seven miles in a stride, was there in no timeat all, and he stopped on the borders of a lake."The porcelain maiden," said the hare to the youth, "will come here tobathe with her friends.  Keep yourself out of sight behind the thicket,while I just eat a mouthful of thyme to refresh me.  When she is in thelake be sure you hide her clothes, which are of dazzling whiteness, anddo not give them back to her unless she consents to follow you."The little hare left him, and almost immediately the porcelain maidenarrived with her friends.  She undressed herself and got into thewater.  Then the young man glided up noiselessly and laid hold of herclothes, which he hid under a rock at some distance.When the porcelain maiden was tired of playing in the water she cameout to dress herself, but though she hunted for her clothes high andlow she could find them nowhere.  Her friends helped her in the search,but, seeing at last that it was of no use, they left her alone on thebank, weeping bitterly."Why do you cry?"  said the young man, approaching her."Alas!"  answered she, "while I was bathing some one stole my clothes,and my friends have abandoned me.""I will find your clothes if you will only come with me."And the porcelain maiden agreed to follow him, and after having givenup her clothes the young man bought a small horse for her which wentlike the wind.  The little hare brought them both back to seek for thegolden blackbird, and when they drew near the castle where it lived thelittle hare said to the young man:"Now, do be a little sharper than you were before, and you will manageto carry off both the golden blackbird and the porcelain maiden.  Takethe golden cage in one hand and leave the bird in the old cage where heis, and bring that away too."The little hare then vanished.  The youth did as he was bid, and thecastle servants never noticed that he was carrying off the goldenblackbird.  When he reached the inn where his brothers were detained hedelivered them by paying their debt.  They set out all together, but asthe two elder brothers were jealous of the success of the youngest,they took the opportunity as they were passing by the shores of a laketo throw themselves upon him, seize the golden blackbird, and fling himin the water.  Then they continued their journey, taking with them theporcelain maiden, in the firm belief that their brother was drowned.But happily he had snatched in falling at a tuft of rushes and calledloudly for help.  The little hare came running to him and said: "Takehold of my leg and pull yourself out of the water."When he was safe on shore the little hare said to him:"Now, this is what you have to do: dress yourself like a Breton seekinga place as stableboy, and go and offer your services to your father.Once there, you will easily be able to make him understand the truth."The young man did as the little hare bade him, and he went to hisfather's castle and inquired if they were not in want of a stableboy."Yes," replied his father, "very much indeed.  But it is not an easyplace.  There is a little horse in the stable which will not let anyonego near it, and it has already kicked to death several people who havetried to groom it.""I will undertake to groom it," said the youth.  "I never saw the horseI was afraid of yet."The little horse allowed itself to be rubbed down without a toss of itshead and without a kick."Good gracious!"  exclaimed the master.  "How is it that he lets youtouch him when no one else can go near him?""Perhaps he knows me," answered the stableboy.Two or three days later the master said to him: "The porcelain maidenis here; but though she is as lovely as the dawn, she is so wicked thatshe scratches every one that approaches her.  Try if she will acceptyour services."When the youth entered the room where she was the golden blackbirdbroke forth into a joyful song, and the porcelain maiden sang too andjumped for joy."Good gracious!"  cried the master."  The porcelain maiden and thegolden blackbird know you too?""Yes," replied the youth, "and the porcelain maiden can tell you thewhole truth if she only will."Then she told all that had happened, and how she had consented tofollow the young man who had captured the golden blackbird."Yes," added the youth, "I delivered my brothers, who were keptprisoners in an inn, and as a reward they threw me into a lake.  So Idisguised myself and came here in order to prove the truth to you.So the old lord embraced his son and promised that he should inheritall his possessions, and he put to death the two elder ones, who haddeceived him and had tried to slay their own brother.The young man married the porcelain maiden and had a splendid weddingfeastTHE HALF-CHICKRetold by Andrew LangONCE upon a time there was a handsome black Spanish hen who had a largebrood of chickens.  They were all fine, plump little birds except theyoungest, who was quite unlike his brothers and sisters.  Indeed, hewas such a strange, queer-looking creature that when he first clippedhis shell his mother could scarcely believe her eyes, he was sodifferent from the twelve other fluffy, downy, soft little chicks whonestled under her wings.  This one looked just as if he had been cut intwo.  He had only one leg, and one wing, and one eye, and he had half ahead and half a beak.  His mother shook her head sadly as she looked athim and said:"My youngest born is only a half-chick.  He can never grow up a tall,handsome cock like his brothers.  They will go out into the world andrule over poultry yards of their own; but this poor little fellow willalways have to stay at home with his mother."  And she called him MedioPollito, which is Spanish for half-chick.Now, though Medio Pollito was such an odd, helpless-looking littlething, his mother soon found that he was not at all willing to remainunder her wing and protection.  Indeed, in character he was as unlikehis brothers and sisters as he was in appearance.  They were good,obedient chickens, and when the old hen chicked after them they chirpedand ran back to her side.  But Medio Pollito had a roving spirit inspite of his one leg, and when his mother called to him to return tothe coop, he pretended that he could not hear, because he had only oneear.When she took the whole family out for a walk in the fields, MedioPollito would hop away by himself and hide among the corn.  Many ananxious minute his brothers and sisters had looking for him, while hismother ran to and fro cackling in fear and dismay.As he grew older he became more self-willed and disobedient, and hismanner to his mother was often very rude and his temper to the otherchickens very disagreeable.One day he had been out for a longer expedition than usual in thefields.  On his return he strutted up to his mother with the peculiarlittle hop and kick which was his way of walking, and cocking his oneeye at her in a very bold way, he said:"Mother, I am tired of this life in a dull f farmyard, with nothing buta dreary maize-field to look at.  I'm off to Madrid to see the king.""To Madrid, Medio Pollito!" exclaimed his mother.  "Why, you sillychick, it would be a long Journey for a grown-up cock, and a poorlittle thing like you would be tired out before you had gone half thedistance.  No, no, stay at home with your mother, and some day, whenyou are bigger, we will go a little journey together."But Medio Pollito had made up his mind, and he would not listen to hismother's advice nor to the prayers and entreaties of his brothers andsisters."What is the use of our all crowding each other up in this poky littleplace?"  he said.  "When I have a fine courtyard of my own at theking's palace, I shall perhaps ask some of you to come and pay me ashort visit."And scarcely waiting to say good-by to his family, away he stumped downthe high road that led to Madrid."Be sure that you are kind and civil to every one you meet," called hismother, running after him; but he was in such a hurry to be off that hedid not wait to answer her or even to look back.A little later in the day, as he was taking a short cut through afield, he passed a stream.  Now, the stream was all choked up andovergrown with weeds and water-plants, so that its waters could notflow freely."Oh!  Medio Pollito," it cried as the half-chick hopped along itsbanks, "do come and help me by clearing away these weeds.""Help you, indeed!" exclaimed Medio Pollito, tossing his head andshaking the few feathers in his tail.  "Do you think I have nothing todo but to waste my time on such trifles?  Help yourself and don'ttrouble busy travelers.  I am off to Madrid to see the king," andhoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, away stumped Medio Pollito.A little later he came to a fire that had been left by some gypsies ina wood.  It was burning very low and would soon be out."Oh!  Medio Pollito," cried the fire in a weak, wavering voice as thehalf-chick approached, "in a few minutes I shall go quite out unlessyou put some sticks and dry leaves upon me.  Do help me or I shalldie!""Help you, indeed!"  answered Medio Pollito.  "I have other things todo.  Gather sticks for yourself and don't trouble me.  I am off toMadrid to see the king," and hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, away stumpedMedio Pollito.The next morning, as he was getting near Madrid, he passed a largechestnut tree, in whose branches the wind was caught and entangled."Oh!  Medio Pollito," called the wind, "do hop up here and help me toget free of these branches.  I cannot come away and it is souncomfortable.""It is your own fault for going there," answered Medio Pollito.  "Ican't waste all my morning stopping here to help you.  Just shakeyourself off, and don't hinder me, for I am off to Madrid to see theking," and hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, away stumped Medio Pollito ingreat glee, for the towers and roofs of Madrid were now in sight.  Whenhe entered the town he saw before him a great, splendid house, withsoldiers standing before the gates.  This he knew must be the king'spalace, and he determined to hop up to the front gate and wait thereuntil the king came out.  But as he was hopping past one of the backwindows the king's cook saw him."Here is the very thing I want," he exclaimed, "for the king has justsent a message to say that he must have chicken broth for his dinner."Opening the window he stretched out his arm, caught Medio Pollito, andpopped him into the broth pot that was standing near the fire.  Oh!how wet and clammy the water felt as it went over Medio Pollito's head,making his feathers cling to him."Water!  water!" he cried in his despair, "do have pity upon me and donot wet me like this.""Ah! Medio Pollito," replied the water, "you would not help me when Iwas a little stream away on the fields.  Now you must be punished."Then the fire began to burn and scald Medio Pollito, and he danced andhopped from one side of the pot to the other, trying to get away fromthe heat and crying out in pain:"Fire!  fire!  do not scorch me like this; you can't think how ithurts.""Ah! Medio Pollito," answered the fire, "you would not help me when Iwas dying away in the wood.  You are being punished."At last, just when the pain was so great that Medio Pollito thought hemust die, the cook lifted up the lid of the pot to see if the broth wasready for the king's dinner."Look here!" he cried in horror, "this chicken is quite useless.  It isburned to a cinder.  I can't send it up to the royal table."  Andopening the window he threw Medio Pollito out in the street.  But thewind caught him up and whirled him through the air so quickly thatMedio Pollito could scarcely breathe, and his heart beat against hisside till he thought it would break."Oh, wind I" at last he gasped out, "if you hurry me along like thisyou will kill me.  Do let me rest a moment, or-"But he was so breathless that he could not finish his sentence."Ah! Medio Pollito," replied the wind, "when I was caught in thebranches of the chestnut tree you would not help me.  Now you arepunished."  And he swirled Medio Pollito over the roofs of the housestill they reached the highest church in the town, and there he left himfastened to the top of the steeple.And there stands Medio Pollito to this day.  And if you go to Madridand walk through the streets till you come to the highest church, youwill see Medio Pollito perched on his one leg on the steeple, with hisone wing drooping at his side and gazing sadly out of his one eye overthe town.THE THREE BROTHERSBy Hermann R. KletkeTHERE was once upon a time a witch who in the shape of a hawk usedevery night to break the windows of a certain village church.  In thesame village there lived three brothers, who were all determined tokill the mischievous hawk.  But in vain did the two eldest mount guardin the church with their guns; as soon as the bird appeared high abovetheir heads sleep overpowered them, and they only awoke to hear thewindows crashing in.Then the younger brother took his turn of guarding the windows, and toprevent his being overcome by sleep he placed a lot of thorns under hischin, so that if he felt drowsy and nodded his head they would prickhim and keep him awake.The moon was already risen and it was as light as day, when suddenly heheard a fearful noise, and at the same time a terrible desire to sleepoverpowered him.His eyelids closed and his head sank on his shoulders, but the thornsran into him and were so painful that he awoke at once.  He saw thehawk swooping down upon the church, and in a moment he had seized hisgun and shot at the bird.  The hawk fell heavily under a big stone,severely wounded in its right wing.  The youth ran to look at it andsaw that a huge abyss had opened below the stone.  He went at once tofetch his brothers, and with their help dragged a lot of pine wood andropes to the spot.  They fastened some of the burning pine wood to theend of the rope and let it slowly down to the bottom of the abyss.  Atfirst it was quite dark, and the flaming torch only lit up dirty graystone walls.  But the youngest brother determined to explore the abyss,and letting himself down by the rope he soon reached the bottom.  Herehe found a lovely meadow full of green trees and exquisite flowers.In the middle of the meadow stood a huge stone castle, with an irongate leading to it, which was wide open.  Everything in the castleseemed to be made of copper, and the only inhabitant he could discoverwas a lovely girl, who was combing her golden hair; and he noticed thatwhenever one of her hairs fell on the ground it rang out like puremetal.  The youth looked at her more closely, and saw that her skin wassmooth and fair, her blue eyes bright and sparkling, and her hair asgolden as the sun.  He fell in love with her on the spot, and kneelingat her feet he implored her to become his wife.The lovely girl accepted his proposal gladly; but at the same time shewarned him that she could never come up to the world above till hermother, the old witch, was dead.  And she went on to tell him that theonly way in which the old creature could be killed was with the swordthat hung up in the castle; but the sword was so heavy that no onecould lift it.Then the youth went into a room in the castle where everything was madeof silver, and here he found another beautiful girl, the sister of hisbride.  She was combing her silver hair, and every hair that fell onthe ground rang out like pure metal.  The second girl handed him thesword, but though he tried with all his strength he could not lift it.At last a third sister came to him and gave him a drop of something todrink, which she said would give him the needful strength.  He drankone drop, but still he could not lift the sword; then he drank a secondand the sword began to move; but only after he had drunk a third dropwas he able to swing the sword over his head.Then he hid himself in the castle and awaited the old witch's arrival.At last as it was beginning to grow dark she appeared.  She swoopeddown upon a big apple tree, and after shaking some golden apples fromit she pounced down upon the earth.  As soon as her feet touched theground she became transformed from a hawk into a woman.  This was themoment the youth was waiting for, and he swung his mighty sword in theair with all his strength and the witch's head fell off, and her bloodspurted upon the walls.Without fear of any further danger, he packed up all the treasures ofthe castle into great chests and gave his brothers a signal to pullthem up out of the abyss.  First the treasures were attached to therope and then the three lovely girls.  And now everything was up aboveand only he himself remained below.  But as he was a little suspiciousof his brothers, he fastened a heavy stone on to the rope and let thempull it up.  At first they heaved with a will, but when the stone washalfway up they let it drop suddenly, and it fell to the bottom brokeninto a hundred pieces."So that's what would have happened to my bones had I trusted myself tothem," said the youth sadly; and he cried bitterly, not because of thetreasures, but because of the lovely girl with her swanlike neck andgolden hair.For a long time he wandered sadly all through the beautiful underworld,and one day he met a magician who asked him the cause of his tears.The youth told him all that had befallen him, and the magician said:"Do not grieve, young man!  If you will guard the children who arehidden in the golden apple tree I will bring you at once up to theearth.  Another magician who lives in this land always eats my childrenup.  It is in vain that I have hidden them under the earth and lockedthem into the castle.  Now I have hidden them in the apple tree; hideyourself there, too, and at midnight you will see my enemy."The youth climbed up the tree and picked some of the beautiful goldenapples, which he ate for his supper.  At midnight the wind began torise and a rustling sound was heard at the foot of the tree.  The youthlooked down and beheld a long thick serpent beginning to crawl up thetree.  It wound itself round the stem and gradually got higher andhigher.  It stretched its huge head, in which the eyes glitteredfiercely, among the branches, searching for the nest in which thelittle children lay.  They trembled with terror when they saw thehideous creature and hid themselves beneath the leaves.Then the youth swung his mighty sword in the air, and with one blow cutoff the serpent's head.  He cut up the rest of the body into littlebits and strewed them to the four winds.The father of the rescued children was so delighted over the death ofhis enemy that he told the youth to get on his back, and thus hecarried him up to the world above.With what joy did he hurry now to his brothers' house!  He burst into aroom where they were all assembled, but no one knew who he was.  Onlyhis bride, who was serving as cook to her sisters, recognized her loverat once.His brothers, who had quite believed he was dead, yielded him up histreasures at once and flew into the woods in terror.  But the goodyouth forgave them all they had done and divided his treasures withthem.  Then he built himself a big castle with golden windows, andthere he lived happily with his golden-haired wife till the end oftheir lives.THE GLASS MOUNTAINBy Hermann R. KletkeONCE upon a time there was a glass mountain at the top of which stood acastle made of pure gold, and in front of the castle there grew anapple tree on which there were golden apples.Anyone who picked an apple gained admittance into the golden castle,and there in a silver room sat an enchanted princess of surpassingfairness and beauty.  She was as rich, too, as she was beautiful, forthe cellars of the castle were full of precious stones, and greatchests of the finest gold stood round the walls of all the rooms.Many knights had come from afar to try their luck, but it was in vainthey attempted to climb the mountain.  In spite of having their horsesshod with sharp nails, no one managed to get more than halfway up, andthen they all fell back right down to the bottom of the steep, slipperyhill.  Sometimes they broke an arm, sometimes a leg, and many a braveman had broken his neck even.The beautiful princess sat at her window and watched the bold knightstrying to reach her on their splendid horses.  The sight of her alwaysgave men fresh courage, and they flocked from the four quarters of theglobe to attempt the work of rescuing her.  But all in vain, and forseven years the princess had sat now and waited for some one to scalethe glass mountain.A heap of corpses both of riders and horses lay round the mountain, andmany dying men lay groaning there unable to go any further with theirwounded limbs.  The whole neighborhood had the appearance of a vastchurchyard.  In three more days the seven years would be at an end,when a knight in golden armor and mounted on a spirited steed was seenmaking his way toward the fatal hill.Sticking his spurs into his horse he made a rush at the mountain andgot up halfway, then he calmly turned his horse's head and came downagain without a slip or stumble.  The following day he started in thesame way; the horse trod on the glass as if it had been level earth,and sparks of fire flew from its hoofs.  All the other knights gazed inastonishment, for he had almost gained the summit, and in anothermoment he would have reached the apple tree; but of a sudden a hugeeagle rose up and spread its mighty wings, hitting as it did so theknight's horse in the eye.  The beast shied, opened its wide nostrils,and tossed its mane, then rearing high up in the air, its hind feetslipped and it fell with its rider down the steep mountain side.Nothing was left of either of them except their bones, which rattled inthe battered, golden armor like dry peas in a pod.And now there was only one more day before the close of the sevenyears.  Then there arrived on the scene a mere school boy-a merry,happy-hearted youth, but at the same time strong and well grown.  Hesaw how many knights had broken their necks in vain, but undaunted heapproached the steep mountain on foot and began the ascent.For long he had heard his parents speak of the beautiful princess whosat in the golden castle at the top of the glass mountain.  He listenedto all he heard and determined that he too would try his luck.  Butfirst he went to the forest and caught a lynx, and cutting off thecreature's sharp claws, he fastened them on to his own hands and feet.Armed with these weapons he boldly started up the glass mountain.  Thesun was nearly going down, and the youth had not got more than halfwayup.  He could hardly draw breath he was so worn out, and his mouth wasparched by thirst.  A huge black cloud passed over his head, but invain did he beg and beseech her to let a drop of water fall on him.  Heopened his mouth, but the black cloud sailed past and not as much as adrop of dew moistened his dry lips.His feet were torn and bleeding, and he could only hold on now with hishands.  Evening closed in, and he strained his eyes to see if he couldbehold the top of the mountain.  Then he gazed beneath him, and what asight met his eyes!  A yawning abyss, with certain and terrible deathat the bottom, reeking with half-decayed bodies of horses and riders!And this had been the end of all the other brave men who like himselfhad attempted the ascent.It was almost pitch dark now, and only the stars lit up the glassmountain.  The poor boy still clung on as if glued to the glass by hisblood-stained hands.  He made no struggle to get higher, for all hisstrength had left him, and seeing no hope he calmly awaited death.Then all of a sudden he fell into a deep sleep, and forgetful of hisdangerous position he slumbered sweetly.  But all the same, although heslept, he had stuck his sharp claws so firmly into the glass that hewas quite safe not to fall.Now, the golden apple tree was guarded by the eagle which hadoverthrown the golden knight and his horse.  Every night it flew roundthe glass mountain keeping a careful lookout, and no sooner had themoon emerged from the clouds than the bird rose up from the apple tree,and circling round in the air caught sight of the sleeping youth.Greedy for carrion, and sure that this must be a fresh corpse, the birdswooped down upon the boy.  But he was awake now, and perceiving theeagle, he determined by its help to save himself.The eagle dug its sharp claws into the tender flesh of the youth, buthe bore the pain without a sound and seized the bird's two feet withhis hands.  The creature in terror lifted him high up into the air andbegan to circle round the tower of the castle.  The youth held onbravely.  He saw the glittering palace, which by the pale rays of themoon looked like a dim lamp; and he saw the high windows, and round oneof them a balcony in which the beautiful princess sat lost in sadthoughts.  Then the boy saw that he was close to the apple tree, anddrawing a small knife from his belt he cut off both the eagle's feet.The bird rose up in the air in its agony and vanished into the clouds,and the youth fell on to the broad branches of the apple tree.Then he drew out the claws of the eagle's feet that had remained in hisflesh and put the peel of one of the golden apples on the wound, and inone moment it was healed and well again.  He pulled several of thebeautiful apples and put them in his pocket; then he entered thecastle.  The door was guarded by a great dragon, but as soon as hethrew an apple at it the beast vanished.At the same moment a gate opened, and the youth perceived a courtyardfull of flowers and beautiful trees, and on a balcony sat the lovelyenchanted princess with her retinue.As soon as she saw the youth she ran toward him and greeted him as herhusband and master.  She gave him all her treasures, and the youthbecame a rich and mighty ruler.  But he never returned to the earth,for only the mighty eagle, who had been the guardian of the princessand of the castle, could have carried on his wings the enormoustreasure down to the world.  But as the eagle had lost its feet, itdied, and its body was found in a wood on the glass mountain.One day when the youth was strolling about the palace garden with theprincess, his wife, he looked down over the edge of the glass mountainand saw to his astonishment a great number of people gathered there.He blew his silver whistle, and the swallow who acted as messenger inthe golden castle flew past."Fly down and ask what the matter is," he said to the little bird, whosped off like lightning and soon returned saying:"The blood of the eagle has restored all the people below to life.  Allthose who have perished on this mountain are awakening up to-day, as itwere from a sleep, and are mounting their horses, and the wholepopulation are gazing on this unheard-of wonder with joy andamazement."HUNTSMAN THE UNLUCKYBy John T. NaakéONCE upon a time there lived a huntsman.  He would go every day insearch of game, but it often happened that he killed nothing, and sowas obliged to return home with his bag empty.  On that account he wasnicknamed "Huntsman the Unlucky."  At last he was reduced by his illfortune to such extremities that he had not a piece of bread nor akopek left.  The wretched man wandered about the forest, cold andhungry; he had eaten nothing for three days, and was nearly dying ofstarvation.  He lay down on the grass determined to put an end to hisexistence; happily better thoughts came into his mind; he crossedhimself, and threw away the gun.  Suddenly he heard a rustling noisenear him.  It seemed to issue from some thick grass close at hand.  Thehunter got up and approached the spot.  He then observed that the grasspartly hid a gloomy abyss, from the bottom of which there rose a stone,and on it lay a small jar.  As he looked and listened the hunter hearda small voice crying-"Dear, kind traveler, release me!"The voice seemed to proceed from the little jar.  The courageoushunter, walking carefully from one stone to another, approached thespot where the jar lay, took it up gently, and heard a voice cryingfrom within like the chirping of a grasshopper-"Release me, and I will be of service to you.""Who are you, my little friend?" asked Huntsman the Unlucky."I have no name, and cannot be seen by human eyes," answered a softvoice.  "If you want me, call 'Murza!'  A wicked magician put me inthis jar, sealed it with the seal of King Solomon, and then threw meinto this fearful place, where I have lain for seventy years.""Very good," said Huntsman the Unlucky; "I will give you your liberty,and then we shall see how you will keep your word."  He broke the sealand opened the little jar-there was nothing in it!"Halloa!  where are you, my friend?" cried the hunter."By your side," a voice answered.The hunter looked about him, but could see no one."Murza!""Ready!  I await your orders.  I am your servant for the next threedays, and will do whatever you desire.  You have only to say, 'Gothere, I know not where; bring something, I know not what.'""Very well," said the hunter.  "'You will doubtless know best what iswanted: Go there, I know not where; bring something, I know not what."As soon as the hunter had uttered these words there appeared before hima table covered with dishes, each filled with the most deliciousviands, as if they had come direct from a banquet of the czar.  Thehunter sat down at the table, and ate and drank till he was satisfied.He then rose, crossed himself, and, bowing on all sides, exclaimed-"Thank you!  thank you!"Instantly the table, and everything else with it, disappeared, and thehunter continued his journey.After walking some distance he sat down by the roadside to rest.  It sohappened that while the hunter was resting himself, there passedthrough the forest a gypsy thief, leading a horse which he wanted tosell."I wish I had the money to buy the horse with," thought the hunter;"what a pity my pockets are empty!  However, I will ask my invisiblefriend.  Murza!""Ready!""Go there, I know not where; bring something, I know not what."In less than a minute the hunter heard the money chinking in hispocket; gold poured into them, he knew not how nor whence."Thanks!  you have kept your word," said the hunter.He then began to bargain with the gypsy for the horse.  Having agreedupon the price, he paid the man in gold, who, staring at the hunterwith his mouth wide open, wondered where Huntsman the Unlucky had gotso much money from.  Parting from the hunter, the gypsy thief ran withall his speed to the farther end of the forest, and whistled.  Therewas no answer.  "They are asleep," thought the gypsy, and entered acavern where some robbers, lying on the skins of animals, were restingthemselves."Halloa, comrades!  Are you asleep?" cried the gypsy.  "Get up, quick!or you will lose a fine bird.  He is alone in the forest, and hispockets are full of gold.  Make haste!"The robbers sprang up, mounted their horses, and galloped after thehunter.The hunter heard the clatter, and seeing himself suddenly surrounded byrobbers, cried out- "Murza!""Ready!"  answered a voice near him.  "Go there, I know not where;bring something, I know not what."There was a rustling noise heard in the forest, and then something frombehind the trees fell upon the robbers.  They were knocked from theirhorses, and scattered on all sides; yet no hand was seen to touch them.The robbers, thrown upon the ground, could not raise themselves, andthe hunter, thankful and rejoicing at his deliverance, rode on, andsoon found his way out of the dark forest, and came upon a town.Near this town there were pitched tents full of soldiers.  Huntsman theUnlucky was told that an enormous army of Tartars had come, under thecommand of their khan, who, angry at being refused the hand of thebeautiful Princess Milovzora, the daughter of the czar, had declaredwar against him.  The hunter had seen the Princess Milovzora when shewas out hunting in the forest.  She used to ride a beautiful horse, andcarry a golden lance in her hand; a magnificent quiver of arrows hungfrom her shoulder.  When her veil was lifted up she appeared like thespring sunlight, to give light to the eyes and warmth to the heart.The hunter reflected for a little while, and then cried, "Murza!"In an instant he found himself dressed in splendid attire; his jacketwas embroidered with gold, he wore a beautiful mantle on his shoulders,and ostrich feathers hung gracefully down from the top of his helmet,fastened by a brooch of a ruby surrounded by pearls.  The hunter wentinto the castle, presented himself before the czar, and offered todrive away the forces of the enemy on condition that the czar gave himthe beautiful Princess Milovzora for his wife.The czar was greatly surprised, but did not like to refuse such anoffer at once; he first asked the hunter his name, his birth and hispossessions."I am called Huntsman the Unlucky, Master of Murza the Invisible."The czar thought the young stranger was mad; the courtiers, however,who had seen him before, assured the czar that the stranger exactlyresembled Huntsman the Unlucky, whom they knew; but how he had got thatsplendid dress they could not tell.Then the czar demanded:"Do you hear what they say?  If you are telling lies, you will loseyour head.  Let us see, then, how you will overcome the enemy with theforces of your invisible Murza?""Be of good hope, czar," answered the hunter; "as soon as I say theword, everything will be completed.""Good," said the czar.  "If you have spoken the truth you shall have mydaughter for your wife; if not, your head will be the forfeit."The hunter said to himself, "I shall either become a prince, or I am alost man."He then whispered, "Murza, go there, I know not where; do this, I knownot what."A few minutes passed, and there was nothing to be heard or seen.Huntsman the Unlucky turned pale; the czar, enraged, ordered him to beseized and put in irons, when suddenly the firing of guns was heard inthe distance.  The czar and his courtiers ran out on the steps leadingto the castle, and saw bodies of men approaching from both right andleft, their standards waving gracefully in the air; the soldiers weresplendidly equipped.  The czar could hardly believe his eyes, for hehimself had no troops so fine as these."This is no delusion!" cried Huntsman the Unlucky.  "These are theforces of my invisible friend.""Let them drive away the enemy then, if they can," said the czar.The hunter waved his handkerchief.  The army wheeled into position;music burst forth in a martial strain, and then a great cloud of dustarose.  When the dust had cleared away, the army was gone.The czar invited Huntsman the Unlucky to dinner, and asked him numerousquestions about Murza the Invisible.  At the second course the newscame that the enemy was flying in every direction, completely routed.The terrified Tartars had left all their tents and baggage behind them.The czar thanked the hunter for his assistance, and informed hisdaughter that he had found a husband for her.  Princess Milovzorablushed upon receiving this intelligence, then turned pale, and beganto shed tears.  The hunter whispered something to Murza, and theprincess's tears changed into precious stones as they fell.  Thecourtiers hastened to pick them up-they were pearls and diamonds.  Theprincess smiled at this, and overcome with pleasure gave her hand toHuntsman the Unlucky-unlucky no longer.  Then began the feast.  Buthere the story must end.STORY OF LITTLE SIMPLETONBy John T. NaakéONCE there lived a peasant and his wife who had three daughters.  Thetwo elder girls were cunning and selfish; the youngest was simple andopen-hearted, and on that account came to be called, first by hersisters and afterward by her father and mother, "Little Simpleton."Little Simpleton was pushed about, had to fetch everything that waswanted, and was always kept at work; but she was ever ready to do whatshe was told, and never uttered a word of complaint.  She would waterthe garden, prepare pine splinters, milk the cows, and feed the ducks;she had to wait upon everybody-in a word, she was the drudge of thefamily.One day, as the peasant was going with the hay to market, he asked hisdaughters what they would like him to buy for them."Buy me some kumach (Red wool stuff from Bucharest) for a sarafan (Along dress worn by the Russian peasant women) father," answered theeldest daughter."And me some nankeen," said the second.  The youngest daughter alonedid not ask for a present.  The peasant was moved with compassion forthe girl; although a simpleton she was still his daughter.Turning to her he asked "Well, Little Simpleton, what shall I buy foryou?"Little Simpleton smiled and replied-"Buy me, dearest father, a little silver plate and a little apple.""What do you want them for?" asked her sisters."I will make the little apple roll round the plate, and will say somewords to it which an old woman taught me because I gave her a cake."The peasant promised to buy his daughters what they asked of him, andthen started for market.  He sold his hay, and bought the presents:some nankeen for one of his daughters, for another some kumach, and forLittle Simpleton a little silver plate and a little apple.  Then hereturned home and gave these things to his daughters.The girls were delighted; the two elder ones made themselves sarafans,and laughed at Little Simpleton, wondering what she would do with thesilver plate and the apple.Little Simpleton did not eat the apple, but sat down in a corner andcried-"Roll, roll, little apple on the silver plate, and show me towns andfields, forests and seas, lofty mountains and beautiful skies."And the apple began to roll on the plate, and there appeared on it townafter town; ships sailing on the seas, and people in the fields;mountains and beautiful skies; suns and stars.  All these things lookedso beautiful, and were so wonderful, that it would be impossible totell of them in a story, or describe them with the pen.At first the elder sisters looked at the little plate with delight;soon, however, their hearts were filled with envy, and they began totry to get it from their younger sister.  But the girl would not partwith it on any account.  Then the wicked girls said- "Dearest sister,let us go into the forest to gather blackberries."Little Simpleton got up, gave the plate and apple to her father, andwent with them into the forest.  They walked about and gatheredblackberries.  All at once they saw a spade lying upon the ground.  Thewicked sisters killed Little Simpleton with it, and buried her under abirch tree.They returned home late, and told their father, "The Simpleton is lost;she ran away from us in the forest; we searched, but could not find heranywhere.  The wolves must have eaten her."The peasant regretted the loss of his daughter bitterly; for althoughso simple she was still his child.  The wicked sisters also shed tears.Her father put the little silver plate and the little apple into a box,and locked them up.Next morning a shepherd was tending his sheep near the place, playingon his pipe, and searching in the forest for one of his flock that wasmissing.  He observed the little grave under the birch tree; it wascovered by the most lovely flowers, and out of the middle of the gravethere grew a reed.  The shepherd cut off the reed, and made a pipe ofit.  As soon as the pipe was prepared, oh, wonderful!  It began to playof itself, and say-"Play, oh pipe, play!  and comfort my poor parents and sisters.  I waskilled for the sake of my little silver plate and my little apple."When the people heard of this they ran out of their huts, and all cameround the shepherd and began to ask him who was killed."Good people," answered the shepherd, "I don't know who it is.  Whilesearching for one of my sheep in the forest, I came upon a gravecovered with flowers.  Above them all stood a reed.  I cut off the reedand made this pipe of it.  It plays of itself, and you have heard whatit says."The father of Little Simpleton happened to be present.  He took thepipe into his own hand, and it began to play:"Play, oh pipe, play!  Comfort my poor father and mother.  I was killedfor the sake of my little silver plate and my little apple."  Thepeasant asked the shepherd to take him to the place where he had cutthe reed.  They all went into the forest, saw the grave, and wereastonished at the sight of the lovely flowers which grew there.  Theyopened the grave, and there discovered the body of a girl, which thepoor man recognized as that of his youngest daughter.  There she lay,murdered-but by whom no one could tell.  The people asked one anotherwho it was that had killed the poor girl.  Suddenly the pipe began toplay-"Oh, my dearest father; my sisters brought me to this forest, and herekilled me for the sake of my little plate and my little apple.  Youwill not bring me to life until you fetch some of the water from theczar's well."Then the wicked sisters confessed it all.  They were seized and castinto a dark prison, to await the pleasure of the czar.  The peasant setout for the capital.  As soon as he arrived at the city, he went to thepalace, saw the czar, told his story, and begged permission to takesome water from the well.  The czar said, "You may take some water oflife from my well, and as soon as you have restored your daughter tolife, bring her here with her little plate and the little apple; bringyour other two daughters also."The peasant bowed to the ground, and returned home with a bottle fullof the water of life.  He hastened to the grave in the forest, liftedup the body of his daughter, and as soon as he had sprinkled it withthe water the girl came to life again, and threw herself into his arms.All who were present were moved to tears.Then the peasant started again for the capital, and arriving there wentat once to the czar's palace.  The czar came out, and saw the peasantwith his three daughters, two of them with their arms bound, the third,as beautiful as the spring flowers, stood near, the tears like diamondsfalling down her cheeks.  The czar was very angry with the two wickedsisters; then he asked the youngest for her little plate and apple.The girl took the box from her father's hands, and said-"Sire, what would you like to see?  Your towns or your armies; theships at sea, or the beautiful stars in the sky?"Then she made the little apple roll round the plate, and there appearedon it many towns, one after the other, with bodies of soldiers nearthem, with their standards and artillery.  Then the soldiers made readyfor the fight, and the officers stood in their places.  The firingcommenced, the smoke arose, and hid it all from view.  The little applebegan again to roll on the plate, and there appeared the sea coveredwith ships, their flags streaming in the wind.  The guns began to fire,the smoke arose, and again all disappeared from their sight.  The appleagain began to roll on the plate, and there appeared on it thebeautiful sky with suns and stars.The czar was astonished.  The girl fell down on her knees before him,and cried-"Oh, Sire, take my little plate and my little apple, and forgive mysisters!"The czar was moved by her tears and entreaties and forgave the wickedsisters; the delighted girl sprang up and began to embrace and kissthem.  The czar smiled, took her by the hand and said, "I honor thegoodness of your heart, and admire your beauty.  Would you like tobecome my wife?""Sire," answered the beautiful girl, "I obey your royal command; butallow me first to ask my parents' permission."The delighted peasant at once gave his consent; they sent for themother, and she, too, gladly bestowed her blessing."One favor more," said the beautiful girl to the czar.  "Permit myparents and sisters to remain with me."On hearing this the sisters fell down on their knees before her, andcried-"We are not worthy of so much favor!""Dearest sisters," said the beautiful girl, "all is forgotten andforgiven.  They who remember the past with malice deserve to lose theirsight."She then tried to lift them up from the ground, but they, sheddingbitter tears, would not rise.  Then the czar, looking at them with afrown, bade them get up; he allowed them, however, to stay in thepalace.A magnificent entertainment then began: the palace was splendidlylighted up, and looked like the sun among the clouds.  The czar andczarina rode out in an open chariot and showed themselves to thepeople, who cried joyfully-"Long live czar and czarina!  May they shine upon us like the glorioussun for years and years to come!"THE GOLDEN FISHBy L. M. GaskUPON a certain island in the middle of the sea dwelt an old man and hiswife.  They were so poor that they often went short of bread, for thefish he caught were their only means of livelihood.One day when the man had been fishing for many hours without success,he hooked a small Gold Fish, whose eyes were bright as diamonds."Let me go, kind man," the little creature cried.  "I should not make amouthful either for yourself or your wife, and my own mate waits for medown in the waters."The old man was so moved by his pleadings that he took him off the hookand threw him back into the sea.  Before he swam off to rejoin hismate, the Gold Fish promised that in return for his kindness he wouldcome to the fisherman's help if ever he wanted him.  Laughing merrilyat this, for he did not believe that a fish could help him except byproviding him with food, the old man went home and told his wife."What!" she cried, "you actually let him go when you had caught him?It was just like your stupidity.  We have not a scrap of bread in thehouse, and now, I suppose, we must starve!"Her reproaches continued for so long that though he scarcely believedwhat the fish had said, the poor old man thought that at least it woulddo no harm to put him to the test.  He therefore hastened back to theshore, and stood at the very edge of the waves."Golden Fish, Golden Fish!" he called.  "Come to me, I pray, with yourtail in the water, and your head lifted up toward me!"As the last word was uttered the Gold Fish popped up his head."You see I have kept my promise," he said.  "What can I do for you, mygood friend?""There is not a scrap of bread in the house," quavered the old man,"and my wife is very angry with me for letting you go."Don't trouble about that!" said the Gold Fish in an off-hand manner;"you will find bread, and to spare, when you go home."  And the old manhurried away to see if his little friend had spoken truly.Surely enough, he found that the pan was full of fine white loaves."I did not do so badly for you after all, good wife!"  he said, as theyate their supper; but his wife was anything but satisfied.  The moreshe had, the more she wanted, and she lay awake planning what theyshould demand from the Gold Fish next."Wake up, you lazy man!" she cried to her husband, early next morning."Go down to the sea and tell your fish that I must have a new washtub."The old man did as his wife bade him, and the moment he called the GoldFish reappeared.  He seemed quite willing to grant the new request, andon his return home the old man found a beautiful new washtub in thesmall yard at the back of their cabin."Why didn't you ask for a new cabin too?"  his wife said angrily.  "Ifyou had had a grain of sense you would have done this without beingtold.  Go back at once, and say that we must have one.The old man was rather ashamed to trouble his friend again so soon; butthe Gold Fish was as obliging as ever."Very well," he said, "a new cabin you shall have."  And the old martfound one so spick-and-span that he hardly dare cross the floor forfear of soiling it.  It would have pleased him greatly had his wifebeen contented, but she, good woman, did nothing but grumble still."Tell your Gold Fish," she said next day, "that I want to be a duchess,with many servants at my beck and call, and a splendid carriage todrive in.Once more her wish was granted, but now her husband's plight was hardindeed.  She would not let him share her palace, but ordered him off tothe stables, where he was forced to keep company with her grooms.  In afew days, however, he grew reconciled to his lot, for here he couldlive in peace, while he learned that she was leading those around her aterrible life, it was not long before she sent for him again."Summon the Gold Fish," she commanded haughtily, "and tell him I wishto be Queen of the Waters, and to rule over all the fish."The poor old man felt sorry for the fish if they had to be under herrule, for prosperity had quite spoiled her.  However, he dared notdisobey, and once more summoned his powerful friend."Make your wife the Queen of the Waters?" exclaimed the Gold Fish."That is the last thing I should do.  She is unfit to reign, for shecannot rule herself or her desires.  I shall make her once more a poorold woman.  Adieu!  You will see me no more."The old man returned sorrowfully with this unpleasant message, to findthe palace transformed into a humble cabin, and his wife in a skirt ofthreadbare stuff in place of the rich brocade which she had worn oflate.  She was sad and humble, and much more easy to live with than shehad been before.  Her husband therefore had occasion many times tothink gratefully of the Gold Fish, and sometimes when drawing up hisnet the glint of the sun upon the scales of his captives would give hima moment's hope-which, alas!  was as often disappointed-that once againhe was to see his benefactor.THE WONDERFUL HAIRBy W. S. KarajichTHERE once lived a man who was very poor, and who had many children; somany that he was unable to support them.  As he could not endure theidea of their perishing of hunger, he was often tempted to destroythem; his wife alone prevented him.  One night, as he lay asleep, thereappeared to him a lovely child in a vision.  The child said-"Oh, man!  I see your soul is in danger, in the thought of killing yourhelpless children.  But I know you are poor, and am come here to helpyou.  You will find under your pillow in the morning a looking-glass, ared handkerchief, and an embroidered scarf.  Take these three things,but show them to no one, and go to the forest.  In that forest you willfind a rivulet.  Walk by the side of this rivulet until you come to itssource; there you will see a girl, as bright as the sun, with long hairstreaming down her shoulders.  Take care that she does you no harm.Say not a word to her; for if you utter a single syllable, she willchange you into a fish or some other creature, and eat you.  Should sheask you to comb her hair, obey her.  As you comb it, you will find onehair as red as blood; pull it out, and run away with it.  Be swift, forshe will follow you.  Then throw on the ground, first the embroideredscarf, then the red handkerchief, and last of all the looking-glass;they will delay her pursuit of you.  Sell the hair to some rich man;but see that you do not allow yourself to be cheated, for it is ofboundless worth.  Its produce will make you rich and thus you will beable to feed your children."Next morning, when the poor man awoke, he found under his pillowexactly the things the child mad told him of in his dream.  He wentimmediately into the forest, and when he had discovered the rivulet hewalked by the side of it, on and on, until he reached its source.There he saw a girl sitting on the bank, threading a needle with therays of the sun.  She was embroidering a net made of the hair ofheroes, spread on a frame before her.  He approached and bowed to her.The girl got up and demanded-"Where did you come from, strange knight?"The man remained silent.  Again she asked him-"Who are you, and why do you come here?"  And many other questions.But he remained silent as a stone, indicating with his hands only thathe was dumb and in need of help.  She told him to sit at her feet, andwhen he had gladly done so, she inclined her head toward him, that hemight comb her hair.  He began to arrange her hair as if to comb it,but as soon as he had found the red one, he separated it from the rest,plucked it out, leaped up, and ran from her with his utmost speed.The girl sprang after him, and was soon at his heels.  The man, turninground as he ran, and seeing that his pursuer would soon overtake him,threw the embroidered scarf on the ground, as he had been told.  Whenthe girl saw it, she stopped and began to examine it; turning it overon both sides, and admiring the embroidery.  Meanwhile the man gained aconsiderable distance in advance.  The girl tied the scarf round herbosom and recommenced the pursuit.  When the man saw that she was againabout to overtake him, he threw down the red handkerchief.  At thesight of it, the girl again stopped, examined, and wondered at it; thepeasant, in the meantime, was again enabled to increase the distancebetween them.  When the girl perceived this, she became furious, andthrowing away both scarf and handkerchief began to run with increasedspeed after him.  She was just upon the point of catching the poorpeasant, when he threw the looking-glass at her feet.  At the sight ofthe looking-glass, the like of which she had never seen before, thegirl checked herself, picked it up, and looked in it.  Seeing her ownface, she fancied there was another girl looking at her.  While she wasthus occupied the man ran so far that she could not possibly overtakehim.  When the girl saw that further pursuit was useless, she turnedback, and the peasant, joyful and unhurt, reached his home.  Oncewithin doors he showed the hair to his wife and children, and told themall that had happened to him; but his wife only laughed at the Story.The peasant, however, took no heed of her ridicule, but went to aneighboring town to sell the hair.  He was soon surrounded by a crowdof people, and some merchants began to bid for his prize.  One merchantoffered him one gold piece, another two, for the single hair, and soon, until the price rose to a hundred gold pieces.  Meanwhile the king,hearing of the wonderful red hair, ordered the peasant to be called in,and offered him a thousand gold pieces for it.  The man joyfully soldit for that sum.What wonderful kind of hair was this after all?  The king split itcarefully open from end to end, and in it was found the story of manymarvelous secrets of nature, and of things that had happened since thecreation of the world.Thus the peasant became rich, and henceforth lived happily with hiswife and children.  The child he had seen in his dream, was an angelsent down from heaven to succor him, and to reveal to mankind theknowledge of many wonderful things which had hitherto remainedunexplained.THE LANGUAGE OF ANIMALSBy W. S. KarajichA CERTAIN man had a shepherd who had served him faithfully and honestlyfor many years.  One day, as the Shepherd was tending his sheep, heheard a hissing noise in the forest, and wondered what it could he.  Hewent, therefore, into the wood in the direction of the sound, to learnwhat it was.  There he saw that the dry grass and leaves had caughtfire, and in the middle of a burning circle a Snake was hissing.  TheShepherd stopped to see what the Snake would do, for the fire wasburning all around it, and the flames approached it nearer and nearerevery moment.  Then the Snake cried from amid the fire-"Oh, Shepherd!  for heaven's sake save me from this fire!"The Shepherd stretched out his crook over the flames to the Snake, andthe Snake passed along it on to his hand, and from his hand it crawledto his neck, where it twisted itself round.When the Shepherd perceived this, he was greatly alarmed, and said tothe Snake-"What have I done in an evil hour?  Have I saved you to my owndestruction?"The Snake answered him, "Fear not, but carry me to my father's house.My father is the King of the snakes."The Shepherd, however, began to beg the Snake to excuse him, sayingthat he could not leave the sheep; but the Snake answered-"Be not troubled about the sheep; no harm shall happen to them; only goas fast as you can."The Shepherd then walked through the forest with the Snake until hecame to a gate which was entirely made of snakes knotted together.There the Snake on the Shepherd's neck gave a whistle, and all theother snakes untwisted themselves.  Then the Snake said to theShepherd-"When we come to my father's palace he will give you whatever you askfor: silver, gold, and precious stones.  Do you, however, take nothingof these, but beg to know the language of the brutes and othercreatures.  He will refuse you this for a long time, but at last hewill grant your request."Meanwhile they came to the palace, to the father, who, shedding manytears, cried-"For heaven's sake!  my dearest daughter, where have you been?"And she told him in due order how she had been surrounded by the forestfire, and how the Shepherd had rescued her.  Then the King of thesnakes turned to the Shepherd and said to him-"What would you have me give you for the deliverance of my daughter?"The Shepherd answered, "Only let me understand the language of animals;I want nothing else."Then the King said, "That is not good for you; for if I were to bestowupon you the gift of the knowledge of the tongue of animals, and youwere to tell anyone of it, you would instantly die.  Ask, therefore,for something else; whatever you desire to possess, I will give toyou."To which the Shepherd replied-"If you wish to give me anything, then grant me the knowledge of thelanguage of brute creatures; but if you do not care to give me that-farewell, and God protect you!  I want nothing else."  And the Shepherdturned to leave the place.Then the King called him back, saying-"Stay!  come here to me, since you will have it at all hazards.  Openyour mouth."The Shepherd opened his mouth, and the King of the snakes breathed intoit, and said-"Do you now breathe into my mouth."The Shepherd breathed into his mouth, and the Snake King breathed againinto that of the Shepherd.  After they had breathed each three timesinto the other's mouth, the King said-"Now you understand the language of animals, and of all created things.Go in peace, and God be with you!  but for the life of you, tell no oneof this; if you do, you will die on the instant!"The Shepherd returned home through the forest.  As he walked he heardand understood all that the birds said, and the grass and all the otherthings that are upon the earth.  When he came to his sheep and foundthem all together and quite safe, he laid himself down to rest.Scarcely had he lain down when there flew two ravens toward him, whotook their perch upon a tree, and began to talk together in their ownlanguage."What if that Shepherd only knew that underneath the place where theblack lamb lies there is a cellar full of silver and gold!'When the Shepherd heard this, he went to his master, and told him ofit.  The master took a cart with him, and they dug down to a doorleading to the cave, and removed the treasure to his house.  But themaster was an honest man, and gave all the treasure to the Shepherd,saying-"My son, all this treasure is yours, for heaven has given it to you.Buy yourself a house with it, marry, and live happily in it."The Shepherd took the treasure, built himself a house, and, havingmarried, lived a happy life.  Soon he became known as the richest man,not only in his own village, but so rich that there was not his equalin the whole neighborhood.  He had his own shepherd, cow keeper,hostler, and swineherd; plenty of goods and chattels, and great riches.One day, just before Christmas, he said to his wife, "Get some wine,and some brandy, and all things necessary; to-morrow we will go to thefarmyard and take the good things to the shepherds that they may alsoenjoy themselves."The wife followed his directions and prepared all that he had told her.When they arrived on the following day at the farmhouse, the mastersaid to the shepherds in the evening--"Come here, all of you; eat, drink, and be merry.  I will watch overthe flocks for you to-night."  And he went, in very deed, and remainedwith the flocks.About midnight the wolves began to howl and the dogs to bark, and thewolves said in their language-"May we come in and do what mischief we like?  Then you, too, shallhave your share."And the dogs answered in their language, "Come in; and we will eat ourfill with you."But among the dogs there was an old one, who had but two teeth in hishead, and he said to the wolves-"That will not do.  So long as I have my two teeth in my head you shalldo no harm to my master nor his."The master heard it all, and understood what was said.  On thefollowing morning he ordered all the dogs to be killed save only theold one.  The hinds said, "Heaven forbid, sir; that would be a greatpity!"  But the master answered, "Do what I have told you."Then he prepared to return home with his wife, and they both mountedtheir horses.  And as they rode on, the husband got a little ahead,while the wife fell behind.  At last the husband's horse neighed, andcalled to the mare-"Come on!  make haste!  Why do you lag behind!"And the mare answered him, "Ah yes, it is all very easy for you: youhave only one to carry, the master; while I have to carry two, themistress and her baby."The husband turned round and laughed, and his wife seeing this, urgedthe mare forward, overtook her husband, and asked him what he had beenlaughing at."Nothing; I do not know; just something that came into my mind,"answered the husband.But the wife was not satisfied with this answer, and she pressed himagain and again to tell her why he had laughed.But he excused himself, and said-"Let me alone, wife!  What is the matter with you?  I do not knowmyself why I laughed."But the more he denied her the more she insisted upon his telling herwhat he had been laughing at.  At last the husband said to her-"Know then, that if I tell you the reason, I shall instantly die."The woman, however, did not care for that, but urged him to tell hernotwithstanding.Meanwhile they had reached home.  The husband ordered a coffin to bemade immediately, and when it was ready he had it placed before thehouse, and said to his wife-"See now, I now lay me down in this coffin, and then tell you why Ilaughed; but as soon as I have told you I shall die."The husband lay down in the coffin, and looked around him for the lasttime.  And there came the old Dog from the farmyard, and sat down athis head and whined.  The husband seeing this, said to his wife-"Bring a piece of bread and give it to this Dog."The wife brought out a piece of bread, and threw it down to the Dog;but the Dog would not even look at it.  Then the House Cock ran up, andbegan to pick at the bread; and the Dog said to it-"You miserable greedy thing, you!  You can eat, and yet you see thatthe master is going to die!"The Cock answered the Dog, "And let him die since he is such a fool.  Ihave a hundred wives, and I call them all together whenever I find agrain of corn, and as soon as they have come round me, I swallow itmyself.  And if any one of them got angry, I should be at her directlywith my beak.  The master has only one wife, and he cannot even manageher."When the husband heard this he quickly sprang out of the coffin, tookup a stick, and called his wife into the room."Come, wife," he said, "I will tell you what you so much want to hear."Then as he beat her with the stick he cried, "This is it, wife!  Thisis it."In this way he quieted his wife, and she never asked him again what hehad been laughing at.THE EMPEROR TROJAN'S GOAT'S EARSBy W. S. KarajichTHERE once lived an emperor whose name was Trojan.  This emperor hadgoat's ears, and he used to call in barber after barber to shave him.But whoever went in never came out again; for while the barber wasshaving him, the emperor would ask what he observed uncommon in him,and when the barber would answer that he observed his goat's ears, theEmperor would immediately cut him into pieces.At last it came to the turn of a certain barber to go who feignedillness, and sent his apprentice instead.  When the apprentice appearedbefore the emperor he was asked why his master did not come, and heanswered, "Because he is ill."  Then the emperor sat down, and allowedthe youth to shave him.As he shaved him the apprentice noticed the emperor's goat's ears, butwhen Trojan asked him what he had observed, he answered, "I haveobserved nothing."Then the emperor gave him twelve ducats, and said to him-"From this time forth you shall always come and shave me.When the apprentice came home, his master asked him how he got on atthe emperor's, and the youth answered--"All well; and the emperor has told me that I am to shave him infuture."Then he showed the twelve ducats he had received; but as to theemperor's goat's ears, of that he said nothing.>From this time forth the apprentice went regularly to Trojan to shavehim, and for each shaving he received twelve ducats; but he told no onethat the emperor had goat's ears.At last it began to worry and torment him that he dare tell no one hissecret; and he became sick and began to pine away.  His master, whocould not fail to observe this, asked him what ailed him, and aftermuch pressing the apprentice confessed that he had something on hisheart which he dared not confide to anyone, and he added, "If I couldonly tell it to somebody, I should feel better at once."Then said the master-"Tell it to me, and I will faithfully keep it from everybody else; orif you fear to trust me with it, then go to the confessor and confideit to him; but if you will not do even that, then go into the fieldsoutside the town, there dig a hole, thrust your head into it, and tellthe earth three times what you know, then throw the mold in again andfill up the hole."The apprentice chose the last course; went into the field outside thecity, dug a hole, into which he thrust his head, and called out threetimes-"The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears."Then he filled up the hole again, and with his mind quite relieved wenthome.When some time had passed by, there sprang an elder tree out of thisvery hole, and three slender sterns grew up, beautiful and straight astapers.  Some shepherds found this elder, cut off one of the stems, andmade a pipe of it.  But as soon as they began to blow into the newpipe, out burst the words:"The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears!"The news of this strange occurrence spread immediately through thewhole city, and at last the Emperor Trojan himself heard the childrenblowing on a pipe:"The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears!"He sent instantly for the barber's apprentice, and shouted to him-"Heh!  what is this you have been telling the people about me."The poor youth began at once to explain that he had indeed noticed theemperor's ears, but had never told a soul of it.  The emperor tore hissaber out of its sheath to hew the apprentice down, at which the youthwas so frightened that he told the whole story in its order: how he hadconfessed himself to the earth; how an elder tree had sprang up on thevery spot; and how, when a pipe was made of one of its sterns, the talewas sounded in every direction.Then the emperor took the apprentice with him in a carriage to theplace, to convince himself of the truth of the story; and when theyarrived there they found there was only a single stem left.  TheEmperor Trojan ordered a pipe to be made out of this stem, that hemight hear how it sounded.  As soon as the pipe was ready, and one ofthem blew into it, out poured the words:"The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears!"Then the emperor was convinced that nothing on this earth could behidden, spared the barber apprentices life, and henceforth allowed anybarber, without exception, to come and shave him.THE MAIDEN WHO WAS WISER THAN THE KINGBy W. S. KarajichTHERE once lived a poor man in a miserable hovel, who had no one withhim save an only daughter.  But she was very wise, and went abouteverywhere seeking alms, and taught her father also to speak in abecoming manner when he begged.  It happened once that the poor mancame to the king and asked for a gift.  The king demanded whence hecame, and who had taught him to speak so well.  The man said whence hecame, and that it was his daughter who had taught him."And who taught your daughter?"  asked the king.The poor man answered: "God, and our great poverty.''Then the king gave him thirty eggs, saying-"Take these eggs to your daughter, and tell her to hatch chickens outof them, and I will reward her handsomely; but if she cannot hatchthem, it will go ill with you."The poor man went crying back to his hovel, and related to his daughterwhat had passed.  The maiden saw at once that the eggs had been boiled,but she told her father to go to rest, and assured him that she wouldsee that all went well.  The father followed her advice, and went tosleep; the maiden took a pot, filled it with water and beans, and setit on the fire.  On the following morning, the beans being quiteboiled, she told her father to take a plow and oxen, and to plow alongthe road where the king would pass."And," she added, "when you see the king, take the beans, sow them, andcry, 'Hi!  go on, oxen mine!  Heaven be with me, and make my boiledbeans take root and grow!'  And when the king asks you how it ispossible for boiled beans to grow, answer him, that it is quite aspossible as for boiled eggs to yield chickens."The poor man hearkened to his daughter, went away, and began to plow.When he saw the king coming he began to cry-"Hi, go on, oxen mine!  God help me, and make my boiled beans take rootand grow!"The king, hearing these words, stopped on the road, and said to thepoor man-"Here, fellow!  how is it possible for boiled beans to grow?"And the poor man answered him-"Heaven prosper you, king!  just as possible as for boiled eggs toyield chickens."The king guessed at once that it was the poor man's daughter who hadtaught him this answer.  He ordered his servants to seize him and bringhim into his presence.  Then he gave him a bundle of flax, and said tohim-"Take this flax and make out of it ropes and sails and all that iswanted on shipboard; if you do not, you shall lose your head."The poor man took the bundle in great fear, and went crying home to hisdaughter, to whom he related all that had passed.  But the maiden senthim again to rest with the promise that all should go well.  On thefollowing day she took a small piece of wood, awoke her father, andsaid to him-"Take this wood, and carry it to the king; let him cut a spinningwheel, a spindle, and a loom out of it, and I will do all that hedemands of me."The poor man again followed the directions of his daughter; he went tothe king and delivered the maiden's message.  The king was astonishedat hearing this, and began to think what he should do next.  At last hetook up a small cup, and said as he gave it to the father-"Take this cup to your daughter, and let her empty the sea with it, sothat it shall become like a dry field."The poor man obeyed with tears in his eyes, and took the cup to hisdaughter with the king's message.  But the maiden told him he need onlyleave the matter till the morning, when she would see to it.In the morning she called her father, and gave him a pound of tow totake to the king, and bade him say:"Let the king stop up all the springs and river mouths of the earthwith this tow, and then will I dry up the sea for him."And the poor man went and told this to the king.Now the king saw that this maiden was wiser that he was himself, and heordered her to be brought before him.  And when the father and daughterstood in his presence and bowed before him, he said to the daughter-"Tell me, girl, what is it that man hears the farthest?"And the maiden answered- "Great king!  that which man hears thefarthest is the thunder, and a lie."Upon this the king took hold of his beard, and turning to hiscouncilors, demanded of them:"Tell me what my beard is worth?"And when one valued it at so much, and another at so much more, themaiden told them outright that they could not guess it.  "The king'sbeard," she said, "is of as much worth as three rainy days in summertime."The king was astonished and exclaimed, "The maiden has made the bestanswer!"Then he asked her if she would be his wife, nor would he desist frompressing his suit, until she agreed to it.  The maiden bent before himand said-"Glorious king!  let it be as you will; but I beg of you to write on apiece of paper with your own hand, that, should you ever be angry withme, and should drive me forth from your palace, I shall be at libertyto take whatever I love dearest away with me."And the king agreed and wrote out the paper.  After some time hadpassed away, it came, in fact, to pass, that the king became one day soangry with his wife, that he said to her-"I will have you no longer for my wife; leave my palace, and go whereyou will.""Illustrious king!"  answered the queen, "I will obey you.  Permit me,however, to stay here over the night, then in the morning I will goforth."The king granted her prayer; and the queen before supper mixed somebrandy and some sweet herbs in the king's wine, and pressed him topartake of it, saying-"Drink, O king, and be merry.  To-morrow we part; and believe me, Ishall then be happier than when I married you."The king drank too much, and when he was fast asleep, the queen had himlaid in a wagon ready prepared, and drove with him into a rocky cavern.And when the king awoke in the cavern, and saw where he was, he criedout-"Who has brought me here?""I have brought you here," answered the queen.The king demanded of her:"Why have you done this?  Have I not told you that you are no longer mywife?"Then said she, as she drew forth a sheet of paper-"It is true what you say; but see what you yourself have laid down onthis sheet: that when I should leave you, I might take with me, fromyour palace, that which I loved best."When the king heard this, he kissed her, and went back with her to thepalace.THE THREE SONSBy Lady GregoryI'LL tell you a story, says the old man who was bringing fish from thesea; and after that I'll be going on to Ballinrobe, to one that has ashop there and that was reared by my grandmother.  It is likely he'llgive me a tasty suit of clothes.Working all my life I am, working with the flail in the barn, workingwith the spade at the potato tilling and the potato digging, breakingstones on the road.  And four years ago the wife died, and it'slonesome to be housekeeping alone.There was a King long ago in Ireland, and he had three sons, and one ofthem was something silly.  There came a sickness on the King, and hecalled his three sons, and he said to them that he had knowledge theonly thing would cure him was the apples from Burnett's orchard, and hebade them to go look for them, for that orchard was in some far-awayplace, and no one could tell where it was.The three sons went then, and they caught their horses, and put ontheir bridles, and they set out, and went on till they came to threecrossroads.  There they stopped, and they settled among themselves thateach one of them would take one of the roads and go searching for theapples, and they would meet at the same place at the end of a year anda day.The youngest son, that was a bit silly, took the crossest of the roads,and he went on till he came to a cottage by the roadside.  He went in,and there was a withered old man in the house, and he said:  "There isa great welcome before the King of Ireland's son!"  The son wasastonished at that because he thought no one could know him.  He waswell received there, and in the course of the evening he asked the oldman did he know where was Burnett's garden.  "I am a hundred yearsold," said the man, "and I never heard of such a place.  But I have abrother," he said, "that is a hundred years older than I am, and it maybe he would know," he said.So in the morning he gave a canoe to the King's son, and it went on ofitself without him turning or guiding it, till it brought him to theold man's brother, and he got a welcome there and good treatment, andin the course of the night he asked that old man did he know where wasBurnett's orchard."I do not," said he: "though I am two hundred years old I never heardof it.  But go on," he said, "to a brother I have that has a hundredyears more than myself."So in the morning, he went into the canoe, and it went on of itselftill it came to where the third old man was, that was older again thanthe other two, and the King's son asked did he know where was Burnett'sgarden.  "I do not," he said, "although I am three hundred years old;but I will tell you how you will know it," he said.  "Go on till youcome to shore, where you will see a Swan-Gander standing by the water,and he is the one that can tell you and can bring you to it," he said."And ask him to bring you to that garden in the name of the AlmightyGod."So the King's son went on in the canoe till he came where the Swan-Gander was standing on the shore.  "Can you tell me," says he, "wherecan I get the apples that are in Burnett's orchard?  And can you bringme there?"  he said."Indeed," said the Swan-Gander, "I am in no way obliged to your leader,or to whoever it was sent you to me and gave you that teaching.  Andthose apples are well minded," he said, "by wolves; and the only timethey sleep is for three hours once in every seven years.  And itchances they are asleep for those three hours at this time; and so Iwill bring you there," he said.With that he stretched out his wings, and he bade the King's son to geton his back.  And it was long before he could start flying with theweight that was on him; but at last he flew away, and he brought theKing's son to Burnett's garden, and there was a high wall around it,but he flew over the wall, and put him down in the garden.  The King'sson filled his bag with the apples, and when he had done that he wentlooking around, and he came to a large cottage in the garden, and hewent in, and there was no one in the house but a beautiful young girl,and she was asleep.  So he went away; but he brought with him the goldrings and the gold garters that he saw there in the window.He got up again on the back of the Swan-Gander, but it was hard for itto rise with the weight of the bag of apples.  But it did rise at last,and it brought him to where the old man was that was three hundredyears old.  The King's son gave one of the apples to the old man, andno sooner did he eat it than his age left him, and he was like a boy offifteen years.He went on then to the two other old men, and gave an apple to both ofthem, and no sooner did they eat it than they were like young boysagain.Then the King's son went back to the crossroads, for it was the end ofthe year and a day, and he was the first to come there, and he fellasleep.  The two brothers came and saw him there, and they stole thebag of apples from under his head and put in the place of it a bag ofapples that were no use at all.  Then they went on to their father'shouse, and they gave him the apples they had stolen, and he was curedon the moment; but they told him that what the youngest son wasbringing to him was poison apples, that would bring him to his death.The King was very angry when he heard that, and he went to his butlerand said, "Go out to the wood where my son is, and shoot him, and bringhis heart here with you on the top of a gun and throw it to the dogs atthe door; for I will never have him, or anything belonging to him,brought into the house," he said.So the butler got the gun, and went out to the wood; and when he sawthe young man he was going to shoot him.  "Why would you do that?"said he.  So the butler told him all the father ordered him; and theyoung man said, "Do not shoot me, but save me.  And this is what youwill do.  Go into the wood until you meet with a woodcock, and shootit, and take the heart out of it, for that is most like the heart of aman.  Bring the woodcock's heart to my father's house," he said, "andthrow it to the dogs at the door."So the butler did that, and spared him, and took the woodcock's heartand threw it to the dogs at the door.It was a good while after that, a beautiful young lady came to theKing's doorway in a coach and four, and stopped at the door.  "Send outmy husband to me here," she said.  So the eldest son came out to her."Was it you came to the garden for the apples?"  says she.  "It was,"says he.  "What things did you take notice of in the cottage where Iwas?" says she.So he began telling of this thing and that thing that never was in itat all.And when she heard that she gave him a clout that knocked his head assolid as any stone in the wall.Then the second son came out, and she asked him the same question, andhe told the same lies, and she gave him another clout that left hishead as solid as any stone in the wall.When the King heard all that, he knew they had deceived him, and thatit was the youngest son who got the apples for his cure, and he beganto cry after him and to lament that he was not living to come backagain.  "Would you like to know he is living yet?"  says the butler."I would sooner hear it than any word ever I heard," says the King."Well he is living yet, and is in the wood," says the butler.When the young lady heard that, she bade the butler bring her to wherehe was, and they went together to the wood, and there they found him,where he had been living on the fruits of trees through the most of theyear.  When the young lady saw him, she said: "Was it you came to thehouse where I was in the garden?"  "It was," says he."What things did you take notice of in it?""Here they are," says he.  And he put his hand in his pocket, andbrought out the gold rings and the golden garters, and the other signshe had brought away.So she knew that he was the right one, and she married him, and theylived happy ever after, and there was great rejoicing in the King ofIreland's house.HOK LEE AND THE DWARFSRetold by Andrew LangTHERE once lived in a small town in China a man named Hok Lee.  He wasa steady, industrious man, who not only worked hard at his trade, butdid all his own housework as well, for he had no wife to do it for him."What an excellent, industrious man is this Hok Lee!" said hisneighbors.  "How hard he works!  He never leaves his house to amusehimself or to take a holiday as others do!"But Hok Lee was by no means the virtuous person his neighbors thoughthim.  True, he worked hard enough by day, but at night, when allrespectable folk were fast asleep, he used to steal out and join adangerous band of robbers, who broke into rich people's houses andcarried off all they could lay hands on.This state of things went on for some time, and though a thief wascaught now and then and punished, no suspicion ever fell on Hok Lee, hewas such a very respectable, hard-working man.Hok Lee had already amassed a good store of money as his share of theproceeds of these robberies, when it happened one morning on going tomarket that a neighbor said to him:"Why, Hok Lee, what is the matter with your face?  One side of it isall swelled up."True enough, Hok Lee's right cheek was twice the size of his left, andit soon began to feel very uncomfortable."I will bind up my face," said Hok Lee.  "Doubtless the warmth willcure the swelling."  But no such thing.  Next day it was worse, and dayby day it grew bigger and bigger till it was nearly as large as hishead and became very painful.Hok Lee was at his wits' end what to do.  Not only was his checkunsightly and painful, but his neighbors began to jeer and make fun ofhim, which hurt his feelings very much indeed.One day, as luck would have it, a traveling doctor came to the town.He sold not only all kinds of medicine, but also dealt in many strangecharms against witches and evil spirits.Hok Lee determined to consult him and asked him into his house.  Afterthe doctor had examined him carefully he spoke thus:"This, Hok Lee, is no ordinary swelled face.  I strongly suspect youhave been doing some wrong deed which has called down the anger of thespirits on you.  None of my drugs will avail to cure you, but if youare willing to pay me handsomely I can tell you how you may be cured."Then Hok Lee and the doctor began to bargain together, and it was along time before they could come to terms.  However, the doctor got thebetter of it in the end, for he was determined not to part with hissecret under a certain price, and Hok Lee had no mind to carry his hugecheek about with him to the end of his days.  So he was obliged to partwith the greater portion of his ill-gotten gains.When the doctor had pocketed the money he told Hok Lee to go on thefirst night of the full moon to a certain wood and there to watch by aparticular tree.  After a time he would see the dwarfs and littlesprites who live underground come out to dance.  When they saw him theywould be sure to make him dance too.  "And mind you dance your verybest," added the doctor.  "If you dance well and please them they willgrant you a petition and you can then beg to be cured; but if you dancebadly they will most likely do you some mischief out of spite."  Withthat he took leave and departed.Happily the first night of the full moon was near, and at the propertime Hok Lee set out for the wood.  With a little trouble he found thetree the doctor had described, and feeling nervous he climbed up intoit.He had hardly settled himself on a branch when he saw the little dwarfsassembling in the moonlight.  They came from all sides, till at lengththere appeared to be hundreds of them.  They seemed in high glee anddanced and skipped and capered about, while Hok Lee grew so eagerwatching them that he crept farther and farther along his branch tillat length it gave a loud crack.  All the dwarfs stood still, and HokLee felt as if his heart stood still also.Then one of the dwarfs called out: "Some one is up in that tree.  Comedown at once, whoever you are, or we must come and fetch you."In great terror Hok Lee proceeded to come down; but he was so nervousthat he tripped near the ground and came rolling down in the mostabsurd manner.  When he had picked himself up he came forward with alow bow, and the dwarf who had first spoken and who appeared to be theleader said: "Now, then, who art thou and what brings thee here?"So Hok Lee told him the sad story of his swelled cheek, and how he hadbeen advised to come to the forest and beg the dwarfs to cure him."It is well," replied the dwarf.  "We will see about that.  First,however, thou must dance before us.  Should thy dancing please us,perhaps we may be able to do something; but shouldst thou dance badlywe shall assuredly punish thee, so now take warning and dance away."With that, he and all the other dwarfs sat down in a large ring,leaving Hok Lee to dance alone in the middle.  He felt half-frightenedto death, and besides was a good deal shaken by his fall from the treeand did not feel at all inclined to dance.  But the dwarfs were not tobe trifled with."Begin!"  cried their leader, and "Begin!"  shouted the rest in chorus.So in despair Hok Lee began.  First he hopped on one foot and then onthe other, but he was so stiff and so nervous that he made but a poorattempt, and after a time sank down on the ground and vowed he coulddance no more.The dwarfs were very angry.  They crowded round Hok Lee and abused him."Thou to come here to be cured, indeed!" they cried.  "Thou hastbrought one big cheek with thee, but thou shalt take away two."  Andwith that they ran off and disappeared, leaving Hok Lee to find his wayhome as best he might.He hobbled away, weary and depressed, and not a little anxious onaccount of the dwarfs' threat.Nor were his fears unfounded, for when he rose next morning his leftcheek was swelled up as big as his right, and he could hardly see outof his eyes.  Hok Lee felt in despair, and his neighbors jeered at himmore than ever.  The doctor, too, had disappeared, so there was nothingfor it but to try the dwarfs once more.He waited a month till the first night of the full moon came roundagain, and then he trudged back to the forest and sat down under thetree from which he had fallen.  He had not long to wait.  Ere long thedwarfs came trooping out till all were assembled."I don't feel quite easy," said one.  "I feel as if some horrid humanbeing were near us."When Hok Lee heard this he came forward and bent down to the groundbefore the dwarfs, who came crowding round and laughed heartily at hiscomical appearance with his two big cheeks."'What dost thou want?" they asked; and Hok Lee proceeded to tell themof his fresh misfortunes and begged so hard to be allowed one moretrial at dancing that the dwarfs consented, for there is nothing theylove so much as being amused.Now, Hok Lee knew how much depended on his dancing well, so he pluckedup a good spirit and began, first quite slowly and faster by degrees,and he danced so well and gracefully, and made such new and wonderfulsteps, that the dwarfs were quite delighted with him.They clapped their tiny hands and shouted:"Well done, Hok Lee, well done.  Go on-dance more, for we are pleased."And Hok Lee danced on and on, till he really could dance no more andwas obliged to stop.Then the leader of the dwarfs said: "We are well pleased, Hok Lee, andas a recompense for thy dancing thy face shall he cured.  Farewell."With these words he and the other dwarfs vanished, and Hok Lee, puttinghis hands to his face, found to his great joy that his cheeks werereduced to their natural size.  The way home seemed short and easy tohim, and he went to bed happy and resolved never to go out robbingagain.Next day the whole town was full of the news of Hok's sudden cure.  Hisneighbors questioned him, but could get nothing from him, except thefact that he had discovered a wonderful cure for all kinds of diseases.After a time a rich neighbor, who had been ill for some years, came andoffered to give Hok Lee a large sum of money if he would tell him howhe might get cured.  Hok Lee consented on condition that he swore tokeep the secret.  He did so, and Hok Lee told him of the dwarfs andtheir dances.The neighbor went off, carefully obeyed Hok Lee's directions, and wasduly cured by the dwarfs.  Then another and another came to Hok Lee tobeg his secret, and from each he extracted a vow of secrecy and a largesum of money.  This went on for some years, so that at length Hok Leebecame a very wealthy man and ended his days in peace and prosperity.A DREADFUL BOARBy Adele M. FieldeA POOR Old Woman, who lived with her one little granddaughter in awood, was out gathering sticks for fuel and found a green stalk ofsugar-cane which she added to her bundle.  She presently met an elf inthe form of a Wild Boar, that asked her for the cane.  She declinedgiving it to him, saying that at her age to stoop and to rise again wasto earn what she picked up, and she was going to take the cane home andlet her little granddaughter suck its sap.The Boar, angry at her refusal, said that during the coming night hewould come and eat her granddaughter instead of the cane, and went offinto the wood.When the Old Woman reached her cabin she sat down by the door andwailed, for she knew that she had no means of defending herself againstthe Boar.  While she sat crying a vender of needles came along andasked her what was the matter.  She told him, but all that he could dofor her was to give her a box of needles.  The Old Woman stuck theneedles thickly over the lower half of the door, on its outer side, andthen went on crying.Just then a Man came along with a basket of crabs, heard herlamentations, and stopped to inquire what was the matter.  She toldhim, but he said he knew no help for her, but he would do the best hecould for her by giving her half his crabs.  The woman put the crabs inher water jar, behind her door, and again sat down and cried.A Farmer, who was coming along from the fields, leading his ox, alsoasked the cause of her distress and heard her story.  He said he wassorry he could not think of any way of preventing the evil sheexpected, but that he would leave his ox to stay all night with her, asit might be a sort of company for her in her loneliness.  She led theox into her cabin, tied it to the head of her bedstead, gave it somestraw, and then sat down to cry again.A courier returning on horseback from a neighboring town was the nextto pass her door, and he dismounted to inquire what troubled her.Having heard her tale, he said he would leave his horse to stay withher, and make the ox more contented.  So she tied the horse to the footof the bed, and, thinking how surely evil was coming upon her, sheburst out crying anew.A boy just then came along with a snapping turtle that he had caughtand stopped to ask what had happened to her.  On learning the cause ofher weeping he said it was no use to contend against sprites, but thathe would give her his snapping turtle as a proof of his sympathy.  Shetook the turtle, tied it in front of her bedstead, and continued tocry.Some men who were carrying millstones then came along, inquired intoher trouble, and expressed their compassion by giving her a millstone,which they rolled into her back yard.  While they were doing this a Manwent by carrying hoes and a pickaxe, and he stopped and asked her whyshe was crying so hard.  She told him her grief, and he said he wouldgladly help her if he could, but he was only a well digger and could donothing for her except to dig a well.  She pointed out a place in thebackyard, and he went to work and quickly dug a well.On his departure the old woman cried again, until a Paper Seller cameand inquired what was the matter.  When she told him he gave her alarge sheet of white paper, as a token of pity, and she laid itsmoothly over the mouth of the well.Nightfall came.  The old woman shut and barred her door, put hergranddaughter snugly on the wall side of the bed, and then lay downbeside her to await the foe.At midnight the Boar came and threw himself against the door to breakit in.  The needles wounded him sorely, so that when he had gained anentrance he was heated and thirsty, and went to the water jar to drink.When he thrust in his snout the crabs attacked him, clung to hisbristles, and pinched his ears, till he rolled over and over to freehimself.Then in a rage he approached the front of the bed; but the snappingturtle nipped his tail and made him retreat under the feet of thehorse, who kicked him over to the ox, and the ox tossed him back to thehorse.  Thus beset, he was glad to escape to the back yard to take arest and to consider the situation.Seeing a clean paper spread on the ground, he went to lie upon it, andfell into the well.  The Old Woman, hearing the fall, rushed out androlled the millstone down on him and crushed him.THE FIVE QUEER BROTHERSBy Adele M. FieldeAN old woman had five grown-up sons that looked just alike.  The eldestcould gulp up the ocean at a mouthful; the second was hard enough tonick steel; the third had extensible legs; the fourth was unaffected byfire; the fifth lived without breathing.  They all concealed theirpeculiar traits, and their neighbors did not know they were queer.The eldest supported the family by fishing, going alone to the sea, andbringing back loads of spoil.  The neighbors often besought him toteach their sons how to fish, and he at last let all their boys go withhim, one day, to learn his art.  On reaching the shore he sucked thesea into his mouth, and sent the boys to the dry bottom to collect thefish.  When he was tired of holding the water, he beckoned to the boysto return, but they were playing among strange objects and paid no heedto him.  When he could contain the sea no longer, he had to let it flowback into its former basin, and all the boys were drowned.As he went homeward, he passed the doom of the parents, who inquiredhow many fish their sons had caught and how long they would be incoming back.  He told them the facts, but they would not excuse him.They dragged him before the magistrate to account for the loss of theirchildren.  He defended himself by saying he had not invited the boys togo with him, and had consented to their going only when the parents hadrepeatedly urged him; that after the boys were on the ocean bed, he haddone his utmost to induce them to come ashore; that he had held thewater as long as he could, and had then put it in the sea basin solelybecause nothing else would contain it.Notwithstanding this defense the judges decided that since he took theboys away and did not bring them back, he was guilty of murder andsentenced him to be beheaded.He entreated leave to pay, before his execution, one visit to his agedmother, and this was granted.He went alone and told his brothers of his doom, and the second brotherreturned in his stead to the judge, thanked him for having given himpermission to perform a duty required by filial piety, and said he wasthen ready to die.He knelt with bowed head and the headsman brought the knife down acrossthe back of his neck, but the knife was nicked and the neck was leftunharmed.A second knife and a third of finer steel were brought and tried byheadsmen who were accustomed to sever heads clean off at one stroke.Having spoiled their best blades without so much as scratching hisneck, they took him back to prison and informed the judge that thesentence could not be executed.The judge accordingly decreed that he should be dropped into the seawhich covered his victims.When the old woman's son heard this decision he said that he took leaveof his mother supposing that his head was to be cut off, and that if hewas to be drowned he must go to her and make known his fate and get herblessing anew.Permission being given, he went and told his brothers what hadhappened.  The third brother took the place of the second and presentedhimself before the judge as the criminal that was to be sunk in thesea.  He was carried far from shore and thrown overboard, but hestretched his legs till his feet touched bottom, and he stood with hishead in the air.  They hauled him aboard and took him farther fromland, but still his extensible legs supported him above the waters.Then they sailed to mid-ocean and cast him into its greatest depths,but his legs still lengthened so that he was not drowned.  They broughthim back to the judge, reported what had been done, and said that someother method of destroying him must be followed.On hearing this the judge condemned him to death by being boiled inoil.  While the caldron was being heated he begged and obtainedpermission to go and tell his mother of the way he had survived fromthe attempt to drown him, and of the manner in which he was soon to betaken off.His brothers having heard the latest judgment, the fourth one went tobear the penalty of the law and was lowered into the kettle of boilingoil.  In this he disported himself as if in a tepid bath, and he evenasked his executioners to stir up the fire a little to increase thewarmth.  Finding that he could not be fried, he was remanded to prison.At this the populace, the bereaved parents, and the magistrate joinedin an effort to invent a sure method of putting him to death.  Water,fire, and sword all having failed, they finally fixed upon smotheringhim in a vast cream cake.The whole country round made contributions of flour for the pastry, ofsugar for the filling, and of bricks for a huge oven; and it was madeand baked on a plain outside the city walls.Meanwhile the prisoner was allowed to go and bid his mother farewell,and the fifth brother secretly became his substitute.When the cake was done, a multitude of people with oxen, horses, andropes dragged it to the execution ground, and within it the culprit wasinterred.As he was able to exist without air he rested peacefully till the nextmidnight, and then safely crawled forth, returned to his home, anddwelt there happily for many years with his remarkable brothers.THE ACCOMPLISHED AND LUCKY TEAKETTLEBy A. B. MitfordA LONG time ago, at a temple called Morinji, there was an oldteakettle.  One day, when the priest of the temple was about to hang itover the hearth to boil the water for his tea, to his amazement thekettle all of a sudden put forth the head and tail of a badger.  What awonderful kettle, to come out all over fur!The priest, thunderstruck, called in the novices or assistants of thetemple to see the sight; and while they were stupidly staring, onesuggesting one thing and another another, the kettle, jumping up intothe air, began flying about the room.  More astonished than ever, thepriest and his pupils tried to pursue it; but no thief or cat was everhalf so sharp as the wonderful badger kettle.  At last, however, theymanaged to knock it down and secure it; and, holding it in with theirunited efforts, they forced it into a box, intending to carry it offand throw it away in some distant place, so that they might no more beplagued with the goblin.For this day their troubles were over, but as luck would have it, thetinker who was in the habit of working for the temple called in, andthe priest suddenly bethought him that it was a pity to throw thekettle away for nothing, and that he might as well get a trifle for it,no matter how small.  So he brought out the kettle, which had resumedits former shape and had got rid of its head and tail, and showed it tothe tinker.  When the tinker saw the kettle, he offered twenty coppercoins for it, and the priest was only too glad to close the bargain andbe rid of his troublesome piece of furniture.  And the tinker trudgedoff home with his pack and his new purchase.That night, as he lay asleep, he heard a strange noise near his pillow;so he peeped out from under the bedclothes and there he saw the kettlethat he had bought in the temple covered with fur and walking about onfour legs.  The tinker started up in a fright to see what it could allmean, when all of a sudden the kettle resumed its former shape.  Thishappened over and over again, until at last the tinker showed theteakettle to a friend of his, who said, "This is certainly anaccomplished and lucky teakettle-you should take it about as a show,with songs and accompaniments of musical instruments, and make it danceand walk on the tight rope."The tinker, thinking this good advice, made arrangements with ashowman, and set up an exhibition.  The noise of the kettle'sperformances soon spread abroad, until even the princes of the landsent to order the tinker to come to them; and he grew rich beyond allexpectations.  Even the princesses, too, and the great ladies of thecourt, took great delight in the dancing kettle, so that no sooner hadit shown its tricks in one place than it was time for them to keep someother engagement.At last the tinker grew so rich that he took the kettle back to thetemple, where it was laid up as a precious treasure and worshiped as asaint.THE ADVENTURES OF LITTLE PEACHLINGBy A. B. MitfordMANY hundred years ago there lived an honest old woodcutter and hiswife.  One fine morning the old man went off to the hills with his billhook to gather a faggot of sticks, while his wife went down to theriver to wash the dirty clothes.  When she came to the river, she saw apeach floating down the stream; so she picked it up and carried ithomeward with her, thinking to give it to her husband to eat when heshould come in.  The old man soon came down from the hills, and thegood wife set the peach before him, when, just as she was inviting himto eat it, the fruit split in two and a little baby was born into theworld.  So the old couple took the babe and brought it up as their own;and because it had been born in a peach, they called it Momotaro, orLittle Peachhing!By degrees Little Peachling grew up to be strong and brave, and at lastone day he said to his old foster parents-"I am going to the ogres' island, to carry off the riches they havestored up there.  Pray, then, make me some millet dumplings for myjourney."So the old folks ground the millet and made the dumplings for him; andLittle Peachling, after taking an affectionate leave of them,cheerfully set out on his travels.As he was journeying on, he fell in with an Ape, who gibbered at him,and said,"Kia!  kia!  kia!  where are you off to, Little Peachling?""I'm going to the ogres' island, to carry off their treasure," answeredLittle Peachling."What are you carrying at your girdle?""I'm carrying the very best millet dumplings in all Japan."If you'll give me one, I will go with you," said the Ape.So Little Peachhing gave one of his dumplings to the Ape, who receivedit and followed him.  When he had gone a little farther, he heard aPheasant calling-"Ken!  ken!  ken!  where are you off to, Master Peachling?"Little Peachling answered as before; and the Pheasant, having beggedand obtained a millet dumpling, entered his service and followed him.A little while after this they met a Dog, who cried-Bow!  wow!  wow!  whither away, Master Peachling?""I'm going off to the ogres' island, to carry off their treasure."If you will give me one of those nice millet dumplings of yours, Iwill go with you," said the Dog."With all my heart," said Little Peachling.  So he went on his way,with the Ape, the Pheasant, and the Dog following after him.When they got to the ogres' island, the Pheasant flew over the castlegate and the Ape clambered over the castle wall, while LittlePeachling, leading the Dog, forced in the gate and got into the castle.Then they did battle with the ogres and put them to flight, and tooktheir King prisoner.  So all the ogres did homage to Little Peachling,and brought out the treasures which they had laid up.  There were capsand coats that made their wearers invisible, jewels which governed theebb and the flow of the tide, coral, musk, emeralds, amber, andtortoise shells, besides gold and silver.  All these were laid beforeLittle Peachling by the conquered ogres.So Little Peachling went home laden with riches, and maintained hisfoster parents in peace and plenty for the remainder of their lives.THE TWO LIZARDSBy Annie KerIN the old days there lived two lizards, Webubu and Nagari.  Webubu wasplain of speech, and moreover was unable to cry aloud, but Nagari, bystretching his long neck, could produce a sweet low sound, somewhatafter the manner of a whistle.Nagari longed for companions, so he stretched his neck and cried "U-u-u-u-u."  Then many women, hearing the sweet sound, flocked to whereNagari sat, and listened to his music.  This pleased Nagari, and hecontinued to sound his long note.  "U-u-u-u-u," he sang, and the womensat so still, one might have thought them dead or weeping.Webubu, on the contrary, had no one to cheer him in his loneliness."What can I do," he said, "to draw women to me as Nagari has done?  Ihave not a sweet voice as he has.  What can I do?"As he was speaking a thought grew up in his heart, and he began to act.He cut a slim piece of hollow bamboo, and pierced small holes in it.Thus was the first flute (duraio) born.  Webubu then built himself aplatform high in a corkwood tree, which we call "troba" on the beach,and seating himself there he began to play his flute.The women sat patiently around Nagari, while he sounded his one note,"U-u-u!"  But on a sudden, upon the still air, broke the sweet voice ofWebubu's flute.  High and sweet were the notes which Webubu sent forthfrom his flute."M!  m!" said the listening women."U-u-u-u," sang Nagari."Ah, ss-ss-ss!" cried the women.  "Deafen us not with thy 'U,' when wewould hear this strange music!"Nagari was much troubled at this saying, and marveled greatly.  Thenone woman made bold to rise up, and saying, "I shall return," she wentto seek the sweet music.  Now this woman lied, for she never returned.After a time, another woman arose and said, "Stay here, my friends; Ishall return."Then she went in like manner to look for the music.  And she also lied,for she returned not.  And so with each woman, until Nagari was leftsitting alone as he had been at the beginning.Now Webubu was still playing his flute on the platform he had built inthe corkwood tree, when the women came in sight.  He was alarmed forthe safety of his frail platform, when he saw these many peopleadvancing, and he cried, "Come not up into the tree.  Remain below, Ibeseech you, O women!"But the women were consumed with eagerness to be close to the musicwhich had taken their hearts, and they climbed, all of them, until theywere upon the platform of Webubu.Then straightway what he had feared came to pass, and Webubu, and hisflute, and the multitude of women fell crashing through the branches ofthe corkwood tree to the ground beneath.And from that hour until now, all corkwood trees lean toward the earth,as I will show thee, if thou wilt go with me to the beach where theygrow.DE KING AND DE PEAFOWLBy Mary Pamela Milne-HorneONE day once 'pon a time de King hab a party of ladies an' genelmen.An' arter de party, de band was ter come an' play.

He had little enough to break orbite, and once, when there was a great famine in the land, he could notprocure even his daily bread; and as he lay thinking in his bed oneevening, rolling about for trouble, he sighed, and said to his wife,"What will become of us?  How can we feed our children when we have nomore than we can eat ourselves?""Know, then, my husband," answered she, "we will lead them away quiteearly in the morning into the thickest part of the wood, and there makethem a fire, and give them each a little piece of bread; then we willgo to our work and leave them alone, so they will not find the way homeagain and we shall be freed from them."  "No, wife," replied he, "thatI can never do; how can you bring your heart to leave my children allalone in the wood, for the wild beasts will soon come and tear them topieces?""Oh, you simpleton!" said she, "then we must all four die of hunger;you had better plane the coffins for us."  But she left him no peacetill he consented saying, "Ah, but I shall regret the poor children."The two children, however, had not gone to sleep for very hunger, andso they overheard what the stepmother said to their father.  Grethelwept bitterly, and said to Hansel, "What will become of us?"  "Bequiet, Grethel," said he; "do not cry, I will soon help you."  And assoon as their parents had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his coat,and, unbarring the back door, slipped out.  The moon shone brightly,and the white pebbles which lay before the door seemed like silverpieces, they glittered so brightly.  Hansel stooped down, and put asmany into his pocket as it would hold, and then going back he said toGrethel, "Be comforted, dear sister, and sleep in peace; God will notforsake us;" and so saying he went to bed again.The next morning, before the sun arose, the wife went and awoke the twochildren.  "Get up, you lazy things; we are going into the forest tochop wood."  Then she gave them each a piece of bread, saying, "Thereis something for your dinner; do not eat it before the time, for youwill get nothing else."  Grethel took the bread in her apron, forHansel's pocket was full of pebbles; and so they all set out upon theirway.  When they had gone a little distance Hansel stood still, andpeeped back at the house; and this he repeated several times, till hisfather said, "Hansel, what are you peeping at, and why do you lagbehind?  Take care, and remember your legs.""Ah!  father," said Hansel, "I am looking at my white cat sitting uponthe roof of the house, and trying to say good-by."  "You simpleton!"said the wife, "that is not a cat; it is only the sun shining on thewhite chimney."  But in reality Hansel was not looking at a cat; butevery time he stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon thepath.When they came to the middle of the wood the father told the childrento collect wood, and he would make them a fire, so that they should notbe cold; so Hansel and Grethel gathered together quite a littlemountain of twigs.  Then they set fire to them, and as the flame burnedup high the wife said, "Now, you children, lie down near the fire andrest yourself, while we go into the forest and chop Wood; when we areready, I will come and call you."Hansel and Grethel sat down by the fire, and when it was noon each atethe piece of bread, and, because they could hear the blows of an ax,they thought their father was near; but it was not an ax, but a branchwhich he had bound to a withered tree, so as to be blown to and fro bythe wind.  They waited so long that at last their eyes closed fromweariness, and they fell fast asleep.  When they awoke it was quitedark, and Grethel began to cry; "How shall we get out of the wood?"But Hansel tried to comfort her by saying, "Wait a little while tillthe moon rises, and then we will quickly find the way."  The moon soonshone forth, and Hansel, taking his sister's hand, followed thepebbles, which glittered like new-coined silver pieces, and showed themthe path.  All night long they walked on, and as day broke they came totheir father's house.  They knocked at the door, and when the wifeopened it, and saw Hansel and Grethel, she exclaimed, "You wickedchildren!  why did you sleep so long in the wood?  We thought you werenever coming home again."  But their father was very glad, for it hadgrieved his heart to leave them all alone.Not long afterward there was again great scarcity in every corner ofthe land; and one night the children overheard their mother saying totheir father, "Everything is again consumed; we have only half a loafleft, and then the song is ended: the children must be sent away.  Wewill take them deeper into the wood, so that they may not find the wayout again; it is the only means of escape for us."But her husband felt heavy at heart, and thought, "It were better toshare the last crust with the children."  His wife, however, wouldlisten to nothing that he said and scolded and, reproached him withoutend.  He who says A must say B too; and he who consents the first timemust also the second.The children, however, had heard the conversation as they lay awake,and as soon as the old people went to sleep Hansel got up intending' topick up some pebbles as before; but the wife had locked the door, sothat he could not get out.  Nevertheless he comforted Grethel, saying,"Do not cry; sleep in quiet; the good God will not forsake us."Early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed,and gave them each a slice of bread, which was still smaller than theformer piece.  On the way Hansel broke his in his pocket, and, stoppingevery now and then, dropped a crumb upon the path.  "Hansel, why do youstop and look about?" said the father.  "Keep in the path." - "I amlooking at my little dove," answered Hansel, "nodding a good-by to me.""Simpleton!" said the wife, "that is no dove, but only the sun shiningon the chimney."So Hansel kept still dropping crumbs as he went along.The mother led the children deep into the wood, where they had neverbeen before, and there making an immense fire, she said to them, "Sitdown here and rest, and when you feel tired you can sleep for a littlewhile.  We are going into the forest to hew wood, and in the evening,when we are ready, we will come and fetch you."When noon came Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewn hison the path.  Then they went to sleep; but the evening arrived, and noone came to visit the poor children, and in the dark night they awoke,and Hansel comforted his sister by saying, "Only wait, Grethel, tillthe moon comes out, then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I havedropped, and they will show us the way home."  The moon shone and theygot up, but they could not see any crumbs, for the thousands of birdswhich had been flying about in the woods and fields had picked them allup.  Hansel kept saying to Grethel, "We will soon find the way"; butthey did not, and they walked the whole night long and the next day,but still they did not come out of the wood; and they got so hungry,for they had nothing to eat but the berries which they found upon thebushes.Soon they got so tired that they could not drag themselves along, sothey laid down under a tree and went to sleep.It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house,and they still walked on; but they only got deeper and deeper into thewood, and Hansel saw that if help did not come very soon they would dieof hunger.As soon as it was noon they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sittingupon a bough which sang so sweetly that they stood still and listenedto it.  It soon left off, and spreading its wings, flew off; and theyfollowed it until it arrived at a cottage, upon the roof of which itperched; and when they went close up to it they saw that the cottagewas made of bread and cakes, and the windowpanes were of clear sugar."We will go in there," said Hansel, "and have a glorious feast.  I willeat a piece of the roof, and you can eat the window.  Will they not besweet?"  So Hansel reached up and broke a piece off the roof, in orderto see how it tasted; while Grethel stepped up to the window and beganto bite it.  Then a sweet voice called out in the room, "Tip-tap, tip-tap, who raps at my door?" and the children answered, "The wind, thewind, the child of heaven"; and they went on eating withoutinterruption.  Hansel thought the roof tasted very nice, and so he toreoff a great piece; while Grethel broke a large round pane out of thewindow, and sat down quite contentedly.  Just then the door opened, anda very old woman, walking upon crutches, came out.  Hansel and Grethelwere so frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands; butthe old woman, nodding her head, said, "Ah, you dear children, what hasbrought you here?  Come in and stop with me, and no harm shall befallyou;" and so saying she took them both by the hand, and led them intoher cottage.  A good meal of milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, andnuts, was spread on the table, and in the back room were two nicelittle beds, covered with white, where Hansel and Grethel laidthemselves down, and thought themselves in heaven.  The old woman hadbehaved very kindly to them, but in reality she was a wicked witch whowaylaid children, and built the bread house in order to entice them in;but as soon as they were in her power she killed them, cooked and atethem, and made a great festival of the day.  Witches have red eyes, andcannot see very far; but they have a fine sense of smelling, like wildbeasts, so that they know when children approach them.  When Hansel andGrethel came near the witch's house she laughed wickedly, saying, "Herecome two who shall not escape me."  And early in the morning, beforethey awoke, she went up to them, and saw how lovingly they laysleeping, with their chubby red cheeks; and she mumbled to herself,"That will be a good bite." Then she took up Hansel with her roughhand, and shut him up in a little cage with a lattice door; andalthough he screamed loudly, it was of no use.  Grethel came next, and,shaking her till she awoke, she said, "Get up, you lazy thing, andfetch some water to cook something good for your brother, who mustremain in that stall and get fat; when he is fat enough I shall, eathim."  Grethel began to cry, but it was all useless, for the old witchmade her do as she wished.  So a nice meal was cooked for Hansel, butGrethel got nothing else but a crab's claw.Every morning the old witch came to the cage and said, "Hansel, stretchyour finger that I may feel whether you are getting fat."  But Hanselused to stretch out a bone, and the old woman, having very bad sight,thought it was his finger, and wondered very much that it did not getfat.  When four weeks had passed, and Hansel still kept quite lean, shelost all her patience and would not wait any longer.  "Grethel." shecalled out in a passion, "get some water quickly; be Hansel fat orlean, this morning I will kill and cook him."  Oh, how the poor littlesister grieved, as she was forced to fetch the water, and how fast thetears ran down her cheeks!  "Dear good God, help us now!" sheexclaimed.  "Had we only been eaten by the wild beasts in the wood thenwe should have died together."  But the old witch called out, "Leaveoff that noise; it will not help you a bit."So early in the morning Grethel was forced to go out and fill thekettle, and make a fire.  "First we will bake, however," said the oldwoman; "I have already heated the oven and kneaded the dough"; and sosaying she pushed poor Grethel up to the oven, out of which the flameswere burning fiercely.  "Creep in," said the witch, "and see if it ishot enough, and then we will put in the bread"; but she intended whenGrethel got in to shut up the oven and let her bake, so that she mighteat her as well as Hansel.  Grethel perceived what her thoughts were,and said, "I do not know how to do it; how shall I get in?"  "Youstupid goose," said she, "the opening is big enough.  See, I could evenget in myself!" and she got up and put her head into the oven.  ThenGrethel gave her a push, so that she fell right in, and then shuttingthe iron door, she bolted it.  Oh!  how horribly she howled; butGrethel ran away, and left the ungodly witch to burn to ashes.Now she ran to Hansel, and, opening his door, called out, "Hansel, weare saved; the old witch is dead!"  So he sprang out, like a bird outof his cage when the door is opened; and they were so glad that theyfell upon each other's neck, and kissed each other over and over again.And now, as there was nothing to fear, they went into the witch'shouse, where in every corner were caskets full of pearls and preciousstones.  "These are better than pebbles," said Hansel, putting as manyinto his pocket as it would hold; while Grethel thought, "I will takesome home, too," and filled her apron full.  "We must be off now," saidHansel, "and get out of this bewitched forest"; but when they hadwalked for two hours they came to a large piece of water.  "We cannotget over," said Hansel.  "I can see no bridge at all."  "And there isno boat either," said Grethel; "but there swims a white duck, I willask her to help us over;" and she sang,"Little duck, good little duck,Grethel and Hansel, here we stand,There is neither stile nor bridge,Take us on your back to land."So the duck came to them, and Hansel sat himself on, and bade hissister sit behind him.  "No," answered Grethel, "that will be too muchfor the duck, she shall take us over one at a time."  This the goodlittle bird did, and when both were happily arrived on the other side,and had gone a little way, they came to a well-known wood, which theyknew the better every step they went, and at last they perceived theirfather's house.  Then they began to run, and, bursting into the house,they fell on their father's neck.  He had not had one happy hour sincehe had left the children in the forest; and his wife was dead.  Grethelshook her apron, and the pearls and precious stones rolled out upon thefloor, and Hansel threw down one handful after the other out of hispocket.  Then all their sorrows were ended, and they lived together ingreat happiness.My tale is done.  There runs a mouse; whoever catches her may make agreat, great cap out of her fur.THUMBLINGBy William and Jacob GrimmONCE upon a time there lived a poor peasant, who used to sit everyevening by the hearth, poking the fire, while his wife spun.  One nighthe said, "How sad it is that we have no children; everything is soquiet here, while in other houses it is so noisy and merry.""Ah!" sighed his wife, "if we had but only one, and were he no biggerthan my thumb, I should still be content, and love him with all myheart."  A little while after the wife fell ill; and after seven monthsa child was born, who, although he was perfectly formed in all hislimbs, was not actually bigger than one's thumb.  So they said to oneanother that it had happened just as they wished; and they called thechild "Thumbling."  Every day they gave him all the food he could eat;still he did not grow a bit, but remained exactly the height he waswhen first born; he looked about him, however, very knowingly, andshowed himself to be a bold and clever fellow, who prospered ineverything he undertook.One morning the peasant was making ready to go into the forest to fellwood, and said, "Now I wish I had some one who could follow me with thecart.""Oh!  father," exclaimed Thumbling, "I will bring the cart; don't youtrouble yourself; it shall be there at the right time."The father laughed at this speech, and said, "How shall that be?  Youare much too small to lead the horse by the bridle.""That matters not, father.  If mother will harness the horse, I can sitin his car, and tell him which way to take.""Well, we will try for once," said the father; and so, when the hourcame, the mother harnessed the horse, and placed Thumbling in its ear,and told him how to guide it.  Then he set out quite like a man, andthe cart went on the right road to the forest; and just as it turned acorner, and Thumbling called out "Steady, steady," two strange men metit; and one said to the other, "My goodness, what is this?  Here comesa cart, and the driver keeps calling to the horse; but I can see noone."  "That cannot be all right," said the other: "let us follow andsee where the cart stops."The cart went on safely deep into the forest, and straight to the placewhere the wood was cut.  As soon as Thumbling saw his father, he calledto him, "Here, father; here I am, you see, with the cart; just take medown."  The peasant caught the bridle of the horse with his left hand,and with his right took his little son out of its ear; and he sathimself down merrily on a straw.  When the two strangers saw the littlefellow, they knew not what to say for astonishment; and one of themtook his companion aside, and said, "This little fellow might make ourfortune if we could exhibit him in the towns.  Let us buy him."  Theywent up to the peasant, and asked, "Will you sell your son?  We willtreat him well."  "No," replied the man; "he is my heart's delight, andnot to be bought for all the money in the world!"  But Thumbling, whenhe heard what was said, climbed up by his father's skirt, and sethimself on his shoulder, and whispered in his ear, "Let me go now, andI will soon come back again."  So his father gave him to the two menfor a fine piece of gold; and they asked him where he would sit.  "Oh,"replied he, "put me on the rim of your hat; and then I can walk roundand survey the country.  I will not fall off."  They did as he wished;and when he had taken leave of his father, they set out.  Just as itwas getting dark he asked to be lifted down; and, after some demur, theman on whose hat he was, took him off and placed him on the ground.  Inan instant Thumbling ran off, and crept into a mousehole, where theycould not see him.  "Good evening, masters," said he, "you can go homewithout me"; and with a quiet laugh he crept into his hole stillfurther.  The two men poked their sticks into the hole, but all invain; for Thumbling only went down further; and when it had grown quitedark they were obliged to return home full of vexation and with emptypockets.As soon as Thumbling perceived that they were off, he crawled out ofhis hiding place, and said, "How dangerous it is to walk in this fieldin the dark: one might soon break one's head or legs;" and so saying helooked around, and by great good luck saw an empty snail shell.  "Godbe praised," he exclaimed, "here I can sleep securely; and in he went.Just as he was about to fall asleep he heard two men coming by, one ofwhom said to the other, "How shall we manage to get at the parson'sgold and silver?""That I can tell you," interrupted Thumbling."What was that?" exclaimed the thief, frightened.  "I heard some onespeak."  They stood still and listened; and then Thumbling said, "Takeme with you, and I will help you.""Where are you?" asked the thieves."Search on the ground, and mark where my voice comes from," replied he.The thief looked about, and at last found him; and lifted him up in theair."What, will you help us, you little wight?" said they."Do you not see I can creep between the iron bars into the chamber ofthe parson, and reach out to you whatever you require?""Very well; we will see what you can do," said the thief.When they came to the house, Thumbling crept into the chamber, andcried out with all his might, "Will you have all that is here?"  Thethieves were terrified, and said, "Speak gently, or some one willawake."But Thumbling feigned not to understand, and exclaimed, louder still,"Will you have all that is here?"This awoke the cook, who slept in the room, and sitting up in her bedshe listened.  The thieves, however, had run back a little way, quitefrightened; but taking courage again, and thinking the little fellowwished to tease them, they came and whispered to him to make haste andhand them out something.  At this, Thumbling cried out still moreloudly, "I will give you it all, only put your hands in."  Thelistening maid heard this clearly, and springing out of bed, hurriedout at the door.  The thieves ran off as if they were pursued by thewild huntsman, but the maid, as she could see nothing, went to strike alight.  When she returned, Thumbling escaped without being seen intothe barn, and the maid, after she had looked round and searched inevery corner, without finding anything, went to bed again, believingshe had been dreaming with her eyes open.  Meanwhile Thumbling hadcrept in amongst the hay, and found a beautiful place to sleep, wherehe intended to rest till daybreak, and then to go home to his parents.Other things however, was he to experience, for there is muchtribulation and trouble going on in this world.The maid got up at dawn of day to feed the cow.  Her first walk was tothe barn, where she took an armful of hay, and just the bundle wherepoor Thumbling lay asleep.  He slept so soundly, however, that he wasnot conscious, and only awoke when he was in the cow's mouth.  "Ah,goodness!" exclaimed he, "however came I into this mill?" but soon hesaw where he really was.  Then he took care not to come between theteeth, but presently slipped quite down the cow's throat.  "There areno windows in this room," said he to himself, "and no sunshine, and Ibrought no light with me."  Overhead his quarters seemed still worse,and more than all, he felt his room growing narrower, as the cowswallowed more hay.  So he began to call out in terror as loudly as hecould, "Bring me no more food.  I do not want any more food!" Just thenthe maid was milking the cow, and when she heard the voice withoutseeing anything, and knew it was the same she had listened to in thenight, she was so frightened that she slipped off her stool andoverturned the milk.  In great haste she ran to her master, saying,"Oh, Mr. Parson, the cow has been speaking.""You are crazy," he replied; but still he went himself into The stableto see what was the matter, and scarcely had he stepped in whenThumbling began to shout out again, "Bring me no more food, bring me nomore food."  This terrified the parson himself, and he thought an evilspirit had entered into his cow, and so ordered her to be killed.  Assoon as that was done, and they were dividing the carcass, a freshaccident befell Thumbling, for a wolf, who was passing at the time,made a snatch at the cow, and tore away the part where he was stuckfast.  However, he did not lose courage, but as soon as the wolf hadswallowed him, he called out from inside, "Oh, Mr. Wolf, I know of acapital meal for you."  "Where is it to be found?" asked the wolf"In the house by the meadow; you must creep through the gutter, andthere you will find cakes, and bacon, and sausages, as many as you caneat," replied Thumbling, describing exactly his father's house.The wolf did not wait to be told twice, but in the night crept in, andate away in the larder, to his heart's content.  When he had finished,he tried to escape by the way he entered, but the hole was not largeenough.  Thereupon Thumbling, who had reckoned on this, began to make atremendous noise inside the poor wolf, screaming and shouting as loudas he could.  "Will you be quiet?" said the wolf; "you will awake thepeople."  "Eh, what!" cried the little man, "since you have satisfiedyourself, it is my turn now to make merry;" and he set up a louderhowling than before.  At last his father and mother awoke, and came tothe room and looked through the chinks of the door; and as soon as theyperceived the ravages the wolf had committed, they ran and brought theman his ax and the woman the scythe.  "Stop you behind," said the man,as they entered the room; "if my blow does not kill him, you must givehim a cut with your weapon, and chop off his head if you can."When Thumbling heard his father's voice, he called out, "Father dear, Iam here, in the wolf's body!"  "Heaven be praised," said the man, fullof joy, "our dear child is found again;" and he bade his wife take awaythe scythe, lest it should do any harm to his son.  Then he raised hisax, and gave the wolf such a blow on its head that it fell dead, and,taking a knife, he cut it open and released the little fellow, his son."Ah," said his father, "what trouble we have had about you."  "Yes,father," replied Thumbling, "I have been traveling a great deal aboutthe world.  Heaven be praised!  I breathe fresh air again.""Where have you been, my son?" he inquired."Once I was in a mouse's hole, once inside a cow, and lastly insidethat wolf; and now I will stop here with you," said Thumbling."Yes," said the old people, "we will not sell you again for all theriches of the world;" and they embraced and kissed him with greataffection.  Then they gave him plenty to eat and drink, and had newclothes made for him, for his old ones were worn out with traveling.THE SIX SWANSBy William and Jacob GrimmA KING was once hunting in a large wood, and pursued his game so hotly,that none of his courtiers could follow him.  But when eveningapproached he stopped, and looking around him perceived that he hadlost himself.  He sought a path out of the forest, but could not findone, and presently he saw an old woman with a nodding head, who came upto him.  "My good woman," said he to her, "can you not show me the wayout of the forest?"  "Oh, yes, my lord King," she replied, "I can dothat very well, but upon one condition, which if you do not fulfill youwill never again get out of the wood, but will die of hunger.""What, then, is this condition?" asked the King."I have a daughter," said the old woman, "who is as beautiful as anyoneyou can find in the whole world, and well deserves to be your bride.Now, if you will make her your Queen, I will show you your way out ofthe wood."  In the anxiety of his heart the King consented, and the oldwoman led him to her cottage, where the daughter was sitting by a fire.She received the King as if she had expected him, and he saw at oncethat she was very beautiful, but yet she did not quite please him, forhe could not look at her without a secret shuddering.  However, afterall, he took the maiden up on his horse, and the old woman showed himthe way, and the King arrived safely at his palace, where the weddingwas to be celebrated.The King had been married once before, and had seven children by hisfirst wife, six boys and a girl, whom he loved above everything else inthe world.  He became afraid, soon, that the stepmother might not treatthem very well, and might even do them some great injury, so he tookthem away to a lonely castle which stood in the midst of a forest.This castle was so hidden, and the way to it so difficult to discover,that he himself could not have found it if a wise woman had not givenhim a ball of cotton which had the wonderful property, when he threw itbefore him, of unrolling itself and showing him the right path.  TheKing went, however, so often to see his dear children, that the Queennoticed his absence, became inquisitive, and wished to know what hewent to fetch out of the forest.  So she gave his servants a greatquantity of money, and they disclosed to her the secret, and also toldher of the ball of cotton which alone could show the way.  She had nowno peace until she discovered where this ball was concealed, and thenshe made some fine silken shirts, and, as she had learned of hermother, she sewed within each one a charm.  One day soon after, whenthe King was gone out hunting, she took the little shirts and went intothe forest, and the cotton showed her the path.  The children, seeingsome one coming in the distance, thought it was their dear father, andran out toward her full of joy.  Then she threw over each of them ashirt, which as it touched their bodies changed them into Swans, whichflew away over the forest.  The Queen then went home quite contented,and thought she was free of her stepchildren; but the little girl hadnot met her with the brothers, and the Queen did not know of her.The following day the King went to visit his children, but he foundonly the maiden.  "Where are your brothers?" asked he.  "Ah, dearfather," she replied, "they are gone away and have left me alone;" andshe told him how she had looked out of the window and seen them changedinto Swans, which had flown over the forest; and then she showed himthe feathers which they had dropped in the courtyard, and which she hadcollected together.  The King was much grieved, but he did not thinkthat his wife could have done this wicked deed, and, as he feared thegirl might also be stolen away, he took her with him.  She was,however, so much afraid of the stepmother, that she begged him not tostop more than one night in the castle.The poor maiden thought to herself: "This is no longer my place, I willgo and seek my brothers;" and when night came she escaped and wentquite deep into the wood.  She walked all night long and great part ofthe next day, until she could go no further from weariness.  Just thenshe saw a rude hut, and walking in she found a room with six littlebeds, but she dared not get into one, but crept under, and, layingherself upon the hard earth, prepared to pass the night there.  Just asthe sun was setting, she heard a rustling, and saw six white Swans comeflying in at the window.  They settled on the ground and began blowingone another until they had blown all their feathers off, and theirswan's down stripped off like a shirt.  Then the maiden knew them atonce for her brothers, and gladly crept out from under the bed, and thebrothers were not less glad to see their sister, but their joy was ofshort duration.  "Here you must not stay," said they to her; "this is arobber's hiding-place; if they should return and find you here, theywill murder you."  "Can you not protect me, then?" inquired the sister."No," they replied, "for we can only lay aside our swan's feathers fora quarter of an hour each evening, and for that time we retain ourhuman form, but afterward we resume our usual appearance."Their sister then asked them with tears, "Can you not be restoredagain?""Oh, no," replied they, "the conditions are too difficult.  For sixlong years you must neither speak nor laugh, and during that time youmust sew together for us six little shirts of star flowers, and shouldthere fall a single word from your lips, then all your labor will bevain."  Just as the brother finished speaking, the quarter of an hourelapsed, and they all flew out of the window again like Swans.The little sister, however, made a solemn resolution to rescue herbrothers or die in the attempt; and she left the cottage, and,penetrating deep into the forest, passed the night amid the branches ofa tree.  The next morning she went out and collected the star flowersto sew together.  She had no one to converse with, and as for laughingshe had no spirits, so there up in the tree she sat, intent only uponher work.  After she had passed some time there, it happened that theKing of that country was hunting in the forest, and his huntsmen camebeneath the tree on which the maiden sat.  They called to her andasked, "Who art thou?"  But she gave no answer.  "Come down to us,"continued they, "we will do thee no harm."  She simply shook her head,and, when they pressed her further with questions, she threw down tothem her gold necklace, hoping therewith to satisfy them.  They didnot, however, leave her, and she threw down her girdle, but in vain;and even her rich dress did not make them desist.  At last the hunterhimself climbed the tree and brought down the maiden and took herbefore the King.  The King asked her, "Who art thou?  What dost thouupon that tree?  But she did not answer, and then he asked her, in allthe languages that he knew, but she remained dumb to all, as a fish.Since, however, she was so beautiful, the King's heart was touched, andhe conceived for her a strong affection.  Then he put around her hiscloak, and, placing her before him on his horse, took her to hiscastle.  There he ordered rich clothing to be made for her, and,although her beauty shone as the sun-beams, not a word escaped her.The King placed her by his side at table, and there her dignified mienand manners so won upon him, that he said, "This maiden will I tomarry, and no other in the world," and after some days he was united toher.Now, the King had a wicked stepmother who was discontented with hismarriage, and spoke evil of the young Queen.  "Who knows whence thewench comes?" said she.  "She who cannot speak is not worthy of aKing."  A year after, when the Queen brought her first-born son intothe world, the old woman took him away.  Then she went to the King andcomplained that the Queen was a murderess.  The King, however, wouldnot believe it, and suffered no one to do any injury to his wife, whosat composedly sewing at her shirts and paying attention to nothingelse.  When a second child was born, the false stepmother used the samedeceit, but the King again would not listen to her words, but said,"She is too pious and good to act so: could she but speak and defendherself, her innocence would come to light."  But when again the thirdtime the old woman stole away the child, and then accused the Queen,who answered her not a word to the accusation, the King was obliged togive her up to be tried, and she was condemned to suffer death by fire.When the time had elapsed, and the sentence was to be carried out,during which she had neither spoken nor laughed, it was the very daywhen her dear brothers should be made free; the six shirts were alsoready, all but the last, which yet wanted the left sleeve.  As she wasled to the scaffold she placed the shirts upon her arm, and just as shehad mounted it, and the fire was about to be kindled, she looked round,and saw six Swans come flying through the air.  Her heart leaped forjoy as she perceived her deliverers approaching, and soon the Swans,flying toward her, alighted so near that she was enabled to throw overthem the shirts, and as soon as she had so done their feathers fell offand the brothers stood up alive and well; but the youngest wanted hisleft arm, instead of which he had a swan's wing.  They embraced andkissed each other, and the Queen going to the King, who wasthunderstruck, began to say, "Now may I speak, my dear husband, andprove to you that I am innocent and falsely accused;" and then she toldhim how the wicked old woman had stolen away and hidden her threechildren.  When she had concluded, the King was overcome with joy, andthe wicked stepmother was led to the scaffold and bound to the stakeand burned to ashes.The King and the Queen forever after lived in peace and prosperity withtheir six brothers.SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-REDBy William and Jacob GrimmTHERE was once a poor Widow who lived alone in her hut with her twochildren, who were called Snow-White and Rose-Red, because they werelike the flowers which bloomed on two rosebushes which grew before thecottage.  But they were two as pious, good, industrious, and amiablechildren as any that were in the world, only Snow-White was more quietand gentle than Rose-Red.  For Rose-Red would run and jump about themeadows, seeking flowers and catching butterflies, while Snow-White satat home helping her Mother to keep house, or reading to her if therewere nothing else to do.  The two children loved one another dearly,and always walked hand in hand when they went out together; and everwhen they talked of it they agreed that they would never separate fromeach other, and that whatever one had the other should share.  Oftenthey ran deep into the forest and gathered wild berries; but no beastever harmed them.  For the hare would eat cauliflowers out of theirhands, the fawn would graze at their side, the goats would frisk aboutthem in play, and the birds remained perched on the boughs singing asif nobody were near.  No accident ever befell them; and if they stayedlate in the forest, and night came upon them, they used to lie down onthe moss and sleep till morning; and because their Mother knew theywould do so, she felt no concern about them.  One time when they hadthus passed the night in the forest, and the dawn of morning awokethem, they saw a beautiful Child dressed in shining white sitting neartheir couch.  She got up and looked at them kindly, but without sayinganything went into the forest; and when the children looked round theysaw that where they had slept was close to the edge of a pit, intowhich they would have certainly fallen had they walked a couple ofsteps further in the dark.  Their Mother told them the figure they hadseen was doubtless the good angel who watches over children.Snow-White and Rose-Red kept their Mother's cottage so clean that itwas a pleasure to enter it.  Every morning in the summer time Rose-Redwould first put the house in order, and then gather a nosegay for herMother, in which she always placed a bud from each rose tree.  Everywinter's morning Snow-White would light the fire and put the kettle onto boil, and although the kettle was made of copper it yet shone likegold, because it was scoured so well.  In the evenings, when the flakesof snow were falling, the Mother would say: "Go, Snow-White, and boltthe door;" and then they used to sit down on the hearth, and the Motherwould put on her spectacles and read out of a great book while herchildren sat spinning.  By their side, too, laid a little lamb, and ona perch behind them a little white dove reposed with her head under herwing.One evening, when they were thus sitting comfortably together, therecame a knock at the door as if somebody wished to come in.  "Makehaste, Rose-Red," cried her Mother; "make haste and open the door;perhaps there is some traveler outside who needs shelter."  So Rose-Redwent and drew the bolt and opened the door, expecting to see some poorman outside, but instead, a great fat Bear poked his black head in.Rose-Red shrieked out and ran back, the little lamb bleated, the dovefluttered on her perch, and Snow-White hid herself behind her Mother'sbed.  The Bear, however, began to speak, and said: "Be not afraid, Iwill do you no harm; but I am half frozen, and wish to come in and warmmyself.""Poor Bear!" cried the Mother; "come in and lie down before the fire;but take care you do not burn your skin;" and then she continued: "Comehere, Rose-Red and Snow-White, the Bear will not harm you, he meanshonorably."  So they both came back, and by degrees the lamb too andthe dove overcame their fears and welcomed the rough visitor."You children!" said the Bear, before he entered, "come and knock thesnow off my coat."  And they fetched their brooms and swept him clean.Then he stretched himself before the fire and grumbled out hissatisfaction; and in a little while the children became familiar enoughto play tricks with the unwieldy animal.  They pulled his long, shaggyskin, set their feet upon his back and rolled him to and fro, and evenventured to beat him with a hazel stick, laughing when he grumbled.The Bear bore all their tricks good temperedly, and if they hit him toohard he cried out:"Leave me my life, you children,Snow-White and Rose-Red,Or you'll never wed."When bedtime came and the others were gone, the Mother said to theBear: "You may sleep here on the hearth if you like, and then you willbe safely protected from the cold and bad weather."As soon as day broke the two children let the Bear out again, and hetrotted away over the snow, and ever afterward he came every evening ata certain hour.  He would lie down on the hearth and allow the childrento play with him as much as they liked, till by degrees they became soaccustomed to him that the door was left unbolted till their blackfriend arrived.But as soon as spring returned, and everything out of doors was greenagain, the Bear one morning told Snow-White that he must leave her, andcould not return during the whole summer.  "Where are you going, then,dear Bear?" asked Snow-White, "I am obliged to go into the forest andguard my treasures from the evil Dwarfs; for in winter, when the groundis hard, they are obliged to keep in their holes, and cannot workthrough; but now, since the sun has thawed the earth and warmed it, theDwarf's pierce through, and steal all they can find; and what has oncepassed into their hands, and gets concealed by them in their caves, isnot easily brought to light."  Snow-White, however, was very sad at thedeparture of the Bear, and opened the door so hesitatingly that when hepressed through it he left behind on the sneck a piece of his hairycoat; and through the hole which was made in his coat Snow-Whitefancied she saw the glittering of gold; but she was not quite certainof it.  The Bear, however, ran hastily away, and was soon hidden behindthe trees.Some time afterward the Mother sent the children into the wood togather sticks; and while doing so, they came to a tree which was lyingacross the path, on the trunk of which something kept bobbing up anddown from the grass, and they could not imagine what it was.  When theycame nearer they saw a Dwarf, with an old wrinkled face and a snow-white beard a yard long.  The end of this beard was fixed in a split ofthe tree, and the little man kept jumping about like a dog tied by achain, for he did not know how to free himself.  He glared at theMaidens with his red fiery eyes, and exclaimed, "Why do you standthere?  are you going to pass without offering me any assistance?""What have you done, little man?" asked Rose-Red.  "You stupid, gapinggoose!" exclaimed he.  "I wanted to have split the tree, in order toget a little wood for my kitchen, for the little wood which we use issoon burned up with great fagots, not like what you rough, greedypeople devour!  I had driven the wedge in properly, and everything wasgoing on well, when the smooth wood flew upward, and the tree closed sosuddenly together that I could not draw my beautiful beard out, andhere it sticks and I cannot get away.  There, don't laugh, you milk-faced things!  are you dumfounded?"The children took all the pains they could to pull the Dwarf's beardout; but without success.  "I will run and fetch some help," criedRose-Red at length."Crack-brained sheep's head that you are!" snarled the Dwarf; "what areyou going to call other people for?  You are two too many now for me;can you think of nothing else?""Don't be impatient," replied Snow-White; "I have thought ofsomething;" and pulling her scissors out of her pocket she cut off theend of the beard.  As soon as the Dwarf found himself at liberty, hesnatched up his sack, which lay between the roots of the tree, filledwith gold, and throwing it over his shoulder marched off, grumbling andgroaning and crying: "Stupid people!  to cut off a piece of mybeautiful beard.  Plague take you!" and away he went without oncelooking at the children.Some time afterward Snow-White and Rose-Red went a-fishing, and as theyneared the pond they saw something like a great locust hopping about onthe bank, as if going to jump into the water.  They ran up andrecognized the Dwarf.  "What are you after?" asked Rose-Red; "you willfall into the water."  "I am not quite such a simpleton as that,"replied the Dwarf: "but do you not see this fish will pull me in?"  Thelittle man had been sitting there angling, and unfortunately the windhad entangled his beard with the fishing line; and so, when a greatfish bit at the bait, the strength of the weak little fellow was notable to draw it out, and the fish had the best of the struggle.  TheDwarf held on by the reeds and rushes which grew near; but to nopurpose, for the fish pulled him where it liked, and he must soon havebeen drawn into the pond.  Luckily just then the two Maidens arrived,and tried to release the beard of the Dwarf from the fishing line; butboth were too closely entangled for it to be done.  So the Maidenpulled out her scissors again and cut off another piece of the beard.When the Dwarf saw this done he was in a great rage, and exclaimed:"You donkey!  that is the way to disfigure my face.  Was it not enoughto cut it once, but you must now take away the best part of my finebeard?  I dare not show myself again now to my own people.  I wish youhad run the soles off your boots before you had come here!"  So saying,he took up a bag of pearls which lay among the rushes, and withoutspeaking another word, slipped off and disappeared behind a stone.Not many days after this adventure, it chanced that the Mother sent thetwo Maidens to the next town to buy thread, needles and pins, laces andribbons.  Their road passed over a common, on which here and theregreat pieces of rock were lying about.  Just over their heads they sawa great bird flying round and round, and every now and then, droppinglower and lower, till at last it flew down behind a rock.  Immediatelyafterward they heard a piercing shriek, and running up they saw withaffright that the eagle had caught their old acquaintance.  the Dwarf,and was trying to carry him off.  The compassionate children thereuponlaid hold of the little man, and held him fast till the bird gave upthe struggle and flew off.  As soon then as the Dwarf had recoveredfrom his fright, he exclaimed in his squeaking voice: "Could you nothold me more gently?  You have seized my fine brown coat in such amanner that it is all torn and full of holes, meddling and interferingrubbish that you are!"  With these words he shouldered a bag filledwith precious stones, and slipped away to his cave among the rocks.The maidens were now accustomed to his ingratitude, and so they walkedon to the town and transacted their business there.  Coming home, theyreturned over the same common, and unawares walked up to a certainclean spot on which the Dwarf had shaken out his bag of preciousstones, thinking nobody was near.  The sun was shining, and the brightstones glittered in its beams and displayed such a variety of colorsthat the two Maidens stopped to admire them."What are you standing there gaping for?" asked the Dwarf, while hisface grew as red as copper with rage; he was continuing to abuse thepoor Maidens, when a loud roaring noise was heard, and presently agreat black Bear came rolling out of the forest.  The Dwarf jumped upterrified, but he could not gain his retreat before the Bear overtookhim.  Thereupon, he cried out: "Spare me, my dear Lord Bear!  I willgive you all my treasures.  See these beautiful precious stones whichlie here; only give me my life; for what have you to fear from a littleweak fellow like me?  you could not touch me with your big teeth.There are two wicked girls, take them; they would make nice morsels, asfat as young quails; eat them for heaven's sake."The Bear, however, without troubling himself to speak, gave the bad-hearted Dwarf a single blow with his paw, and he never stirred after.The Maidens were then going to run away, but the Bear called afterthem: "Snow-White and Rose-Red, fear not!  wait a bit and I willaccompany you."  They recognized his voice and stopped; and when theBear came, his rough coat suddenly fell off, and he stood up a tallman, dressed entirely in gold.  "I am a king's son," he said, "and wascondemned by the wicked Dwarf, who stole all my treasures, to wanderabout in this forest, in the form of a bear, till his death releasedme.  Now he has received his well-deserved punishment."Then they went home, and Snow-White was married to the prince, andRose-Red to his brother, with whom they shared the immense treasurewhich the Dwarf had collected.  The old Mother also lived for manyyears happily with her two children, and the rose trees which had stoodbefore the cottage were planted now before the palace, and producedevery year beautiful red and white roses.THE UGLY DUCKLINGBy Hans Christian AndersenIT was so glorious out in the country; it was summer; the cornfieldswere yellow, the oats were green, the hay had been put up in stacks inthe green meadows, and the stork went about on his long red legs, andchattered Egyptian, for this was the language he had learned from hisgood mother.  All around the fields and meadows were great forests, andin the midst of these forests lay deep lakes.  Yes, it was rightglorious out in the country.  In the midst of the sunshine there lay anold farm, with deep canals about it, and from the wall down to thewater grew great burdocks, so high that little children could standupright under the loftiest of them.  It was just as wild there as inthe deepest wood, and here sat a Duck upon her nest; she had to hatchher ducklings; but she was almost tired out before the little onescame; and then she so seldom had visitors.  The other ducks likedbetter to swim about in the canals than to run up to sit down under aburdock, and cackle with her.At last one egg-shell after another burst open.  "Piep!  piep!" itcried, and in all the eggs there were little creatures that stuck outtheir heads."Quack!  quack!" they said; and they all came quacking out as fast asthey could, looking all round them under the green leaves; and themother let them look as much as they chose, for green is good for theeye."How wide the world is!" said all the young ones, for they certainlyhad much more room now than when they were in the eggs."D'ye think this is all the world?" said the mother.  "That stretchesfar across the other side of the garden, quite into the parson's field;but I have never been there yet.  I hope you are all together," and shestood up.  "No, I have not all.  The largest egg still lies there.  Howlong is that to last?  I am really tired of it." And she sat downagain."Well, how goes it?" asked an old Duck who had come to pay her a visit."It lasts a long time with that one egg," said the Duck who sat there."It will not burst.  Now, only look at the others; are they not theprettiest little ducks one could possibly see?  They are all like theirfather: the rogue, he never comes to see me.""Let me see the egg which will not burst," said the old visitor.  "Youmay be sure it is a turkey's egg.  I was once cheated in that way, andhad much anxiety and trouble with the young ones, for they are afraidof the water.  Must I say it to you, I could not get them to venturein.  I quacked and I clacked, but it was no use.  Let me see the egg.Yes, that's a turkey's egg.  Let it lie there, and teach the otherchildren to swim.""I think I will sit on it a little longer," said the Duck.  "I've satso long now that I can sit a few days more.""Just as you please," said the old Duck; and she went away.At last the great egg burst.  "Piep!  piep!" said the little one, andcrept forth, it was very large and very ugly.  The Duck looked at it."It's a very large duckling," said she; "none of the others look likethat: can it really be a turkey chick?  Well, we shall soon find out.It must go into the water, even if I have to thrust it in myself."The next day, it was bright, beautiful weather; the sun shone on allthe green trees.  The Mother Duck went down to the canal with all herfamily.  Splash!  she jumped into the water.  "Quack!  quack!" shesaid, and one duckling after another plunged in.  The water closed overtheir heads, but they came up in an instant, and swam capitally; theirlegs went of themselves, and they were all in the water.  The ugly grayDuckling swam with them."No, it's not a turkey," said she; "look how well it can use its legs,and how straight it holds itself.  It is my own child!  On the wholeit's quite pretty, if one looks at it rightly.  Quack!  quack!  comewith me, and I'll lead you out into the great world, and present you inthe duckyard; but keep close to me, so that no one may tread on you,and take care of the cats!"And so they came into the duckyard.  There was a terrible riot, goingon in there, for two families were quarreling about an eel's head, andthe cat got it after all."See, that's how it goes in the world!" said the Mother Duck; and shewhetted her beak, for she too wanted the eel's head.  "Only use yourlegs," she said.  "See that you can bustle about, and bow your headsbefore the old Duck yonder.  She's the grandest of all here; she's ofSpanish blood-that's why she's so fat; and d'ye see she has a red raground her leg; that's something particularly fine, and the greatestdistinction a duck can enjoy; it signifies that one does not want tolose her, and that she's to be known by the animals and by men too.Shake yourselves-don't turn in your toes; a well-brought-up duck turnsits toes quite out, just like father and mother-so!  Now bend yournecks and say 'Quack!'"And they did so: but the other ducks round about looked at them, andsaid quite boldly:"Look there!  now we're to have these hanging on, as if there were notenough of us already! And- fie!-how that Duckling yonder looks; wewon't stand that!"  And one duck flew up at it, and bit it in the neck."Let it alone," said the mother: "it does no harm to anyone.""Yes, but it's too large and peculiar," said the Duck who had bittenit; "and therefore it must be put down.""Those are pretty children that the mother has there," said the oldDuck with the rag round her leg.  They're all pretty but that one; thatwas rather unlucky.  I wish she could bear it over again.""That cannot be done, my lady," replied the Mother Duck.  "It is notpretty, but it has a really good disposition, and swims as well as anyother; yes, I may even say it, swims better.  I think it will grow uppretty, and become smaller in time; it has lain too long in the egg,and therefore is not properly shaped."  And then she pinched it in theneck, and smoothed its feathers.  Moreover it is a drake," she said,"and therefore it is not so much consequence.  I think he will be verystrong: he makes his way already.""The other duckling's are graceful enough," said the old Duck.  "Makeyourself at home; and if you find an eel's head, you may bring it tome."And now they were at home.  But the poor Duckling which had crept lastout of the egg, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and jeered,as much by the ducks as by the chickens."It is too big!" they all said.  And the turkey cock, who had been bornwith spurs, and therefore thought himself an emperor, blew himself uplike a ship in full sail, and bore straight down upon it; then hegobbled and grew quite red in the face.  The poor Duckling did not knowwhere it should stand or walk; it was quite melancholy because itlooked ugly, and was the butt of the whole duckyard.So it went on the first day; and afterward it became worse and worse.The poor Duckling was hunted about by everyone: even its brothers andsisters were quite angry with it, and said: "If the cat would onlycatch you, you ugly creature!"  And the mother said: "If you were onlyfar away!"  And the ducks hit it, and the chickens beat it, and thegirl who had to feed the poultry kicked at it with her foot.Then it ran and flew over the fence, and the little birds in the bushesflew up in fear."That is because I am so ugly!" thought the Duckling; and it shut itseyes, but flew on further; and so it came out into the great moor,where the wild ducks lived.  Here it lay the whole night long; and itwas weary and downcast.Toward morning the wild chicks flew up, and looked at their newcompanion."What sort of a one are you?" they asked; and the Duckling turned inevery direction, and bowed as well as it could.  You are remarkablyugly!" said the Wild Ducks.  "But that is nothing to us, so long as youdo not marry into our family."Poor thing!  it certainly did not think of marrying, and only hoped toobtain leave to lie among the reeds and drink some of the swamp water.Thus it lay two whole days; then came thither two wild geese, or,properly speaking, two wild ganders.  It was not long since each hadcrept out of an egg, and that's why they were so saucy."Listen, comrade," said one of them.  "You're so ugly that I like you.Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage?  Near here, inanother moor, there are a few sweet lovely geese, all unmarried, andall able to say 'Rap?'  You've a chance of' making your fortune, uglyas you are.""Piff!  paff!" resounded through the air; and the two ganders fell downdead in the swamp, and the water became blood red.  "Piff paff!" itsounded again, and the whole flock of wild geese rose up from thereeds.  And then there was another report.  A great hunt was going on.The sportsmen were lying in wait all round the moor, and some were evensitting up in the branches of the trees, which spread far over thereeds.  The blue smoke rose up like clouds among the dark trees, andwas wafted far away across the water; and the hunting dogs came-splash,splash!-into the swamp, and the rushes and the reeds bent down on everyside.  That was a fright for the poor Duckling!  It turned its head,and put it under its wing; but at that moment a frightful great dogstood close by the Duckling.  His tongue hung far out of his mouth, andhis eyes gleamed horrible and ugly; he thrust out his nose closeagainst the Duckling, showed his Sharp teeth, and-splash, splash!-on hewent, without seizing it."O, Heaven be thanked!" sighed the Duckling.  "I am so ugly, that eventhe dog does not like to bite me!"And so it lay quite quiet, while the shots rattled through the reedsand gun after gun was fired.  At last, late in the day, all was still;but the poor Duckling did not dare to rise up; it waited several hoursbefore it looked round, and then hastened away out of the moor as fastit could.  It ran on over field and meadow; there was such a stormraging that it was difficult to get from one place to another.Toward evening the Duck came to a little miserable peasant's hut.  Thishut was so dilapidated that it did not itself know on which side itshould fall; and that's why it remained standing.  The storm whistledround the Duckling in such a way that the poor creature was obliged tosit down, to stand against it; and the wind blew worse and worse.  Thenthe Duckling noticed that one of the hinges of the door had given way,and the door hung so slanting that the Duckling could slip through thecrack into the room; and that is what it did.Here lived a woman, with her Cat and her Hen.  And the Cat, whom shecalled Sonnie, could arch his back and purr, he could even give outsparks; but for that one had to stroke his fur the wrong way.  The Henhad quite little short legs, and therefore she was called ChickabiddyShortshanks; she laid good eggs, and the woman loved her as her ownchild.In the morning the strange Duckling was at once noticed, and the Catbegan to purr and the Hen to cluck."What's this?" said the woman, and looked all round; but she could notsee well, and therefore she thought the Duckling was a fat duck thathad strayed.  "This is a rare prize!" she said, "Now I shall haveducks' eggs.  I hope it is not a drake.  We must try that."And so the Duckling was admitted on trial for three weeks; but no eggscame.  And the Cat was master of the house, and the Hen was the lady,and always said "We and the world!" for she thought they were half theworld, and by far the better half.  The Duckling thought one might havea different opinion, but the Hen would not allow it."Can you lay eggs?" she asked."No.""Then will you hold your tongue!"And the Cat said, "Can you curve your back, and purr, and give outsparks?""No.""Then you will please have no opinion of your own when sensible folksare speaking.And the Duckling sat in a corner and was melancholy; then the fresh airand the sunshine streamed in; and it was seized with such a strangelonging to swim on the water, that it could not help telling the Hen ofit."What are you thinking of?" cried the Hen.  "You have nothing to do,that's why you have these fancies.  Lay eggs, or purr, and they willpass over.""But it is so charming to swim on the water!" said the Duckling, "sorefreshing to let it close over one's head, and to dive down to thebottom.""Yes, that must be a mighty pleasure, truly," quoth the Hen.  "I fancyyou must have gone crazy.  Ask the Cat about it-he's the cleverestanimal I know-ask him if he likes to swim on the water, or to divedown: I won't speak about myself.  Ask our mistress, the old woman; noone in the world is cleverer than she.  Do you think she has any desireto swim, and to let the water close above her head?""You don't understand me," said the Duckling."We don't understand you?  Then pray who is to understand you?  Yousurely don't pretend to be cleverer than the Cat and the woman-I won'tsay anything of myself.  Don't be conceited, child, and thank yourMaker for all the kindness you have received.  Did you not get into awarm room, and have you not fallen into company from which you maylearn something?  But you are a chatterer, and it is not pleasant toassociate with you.  You may believe me, I speak for your good.  I tellyou disagreeable things, and by that one may always know one's truefriends!  Only take care that you learn to lay eggs, or to purr, andgive out sparks!""I think I will go out into the wide world," said the Duckling."Yes, do go," replied the Hen.And so the Duckling went away.  It swam on the water, and dived, but itwas slighted by every creature because of its ugliness.Now came the autumn.  The leaves in the forest turned yellow and brown;the wind caught them so that they danced about, and up in the air itwas very cold.  The clouds hung low, heavy with hail and snowflakes,and on the fence stood the raven, crying, "Croak!  croak!" for merecold; yes, it was enough to make one feel cold to think of this.  Thepoor little Duckling certainly had not a good time.  One evening-thesun was just setting in his beauty-there came a whole flock of great,handsome birds out of the bushes; they were dazzlingly white, withlong, flexible necks; they were swans.  They uttered a very peculiarcry, spread forth their glorious great wings, and flew away from thatcold region to warmer lands, to fair open lakes.  They mounted so high,so high!  and the ugly Duckling felt quite strangely as it watchedthem.  It turned round and round in the water like a wheel, stretchedout its neck toward them, and uttered such a strange, loud cry asfrightened itself.  Oh!  it could not forget those beautiful, happybirds; and so soon as it could see them no longer, it dived down to thevery bottom, and when it came up again, it was quite beside itself.  Itknew not the name of those birds, and knew not whither they wereflying; but it loved them more than it had ever loved anyone.  It wasnot at all envious of them.  How could it think of wishing to possesssuch loveliness as they had?  It would have been glad if only the duckswould have endured its company the poor, ugly creature!And the winter grew cold, very cold!  The Duckling was forced to swimabout in the water, to prevent the surface from freezing entirely; butevery night the hole in which it swam about became smaller and smaller.It froze so hard that the icy covering crackled again; and the Ducklingwas obliged to use its legs continually to prevent the hole fromfreezing up.  At last it became exhausted, and lay quite still, andthus froze fast into the ice.  Early in the morning a peasant came by,and when he saw what had happened, he took his wooden shoe, broke theice crust to pieces, and carried the Duckling home to his wife.  Thenit came to itself again.  The children wanted to play with it; but theDuckling thought they wanted to hurt it, and in its terror fluttered upinto the milk pan, so that the milk spurted down into the room.  Thewoman clasped her hands, at which the Duckling flew down into thebutter tub, and then into the meal barrel and out again.  How it lookedthen!  The woman screamed, and struck at it with the fire tongs; thechildren tumbled over one another in their efforts to catch theDuckling; and they laughed and they screamed!-well it was that the doorstood open, and the poor creature was able to slip out between theshrubs into the newly fallen snow-there it lay quite exhausted.But it would be too melancholy if I were to tell all the misery andcare which the Duckling had to endure in the hard winter.  It lay outon the moor among the reeds, when the sun began to shine again and thelarks to sing: it was a beautiful spring.Then all at once the Duckling could flap its wings: they beat the airmore strongly than before, and bore it strongly away; and before itwell knew how all this happened, it found itself in a great garden,where the elder trees smelled sweet, and bent their long green branchesdown to the canal that wound through the region.  Oh, here it was sobeautiful, such a gladness of spring!  and from the thicket came threeglorious white swans; they rustled their wings, and swam lightly on thewater.  The Duckling knew the splendid creatures, and felt oppressed bya peculiar sadness."I will fly away to them, to the royal birds!  and they will beat me,because I, that am so ugly, dare to come near them.  But it is all thesame.  Better to be killed by them than to be pursued by ducks, andbeaten by fowls, and pushed about by the girl who takes care of thepoultry yard, and to suffer hunger in winter!"  And it flew out intothe water, and swam toward the beautiful swans: these looked at it, andcame sailing down upon it with outspread wings.  "Kill me!" said thepoor creature, and bent its head down upon the water, expecting nothingbut death.  But what was this that it saw in the clear water?  Itbeheld its own image; and, lo!  it was no longer a clumsy, dark-graybird, ugly and hateful to look at, but a-swan!It matters nothing if one is born in a duck yard, if one has only lainin a swan's egg.It felt quite glad at all the need and misfortune it had suffered, nowit realized its happiness in all the splendor that surrounded it.  Andthe great swans swam round it, and stroked it with their beaks.Into the garden came little children, who threw bread and corn into thewater; and the youngest cried, "There is a new one!" and the otherchildren shouted joyously, "Yes, a new one has arrived!"  And theyclapped their hands and danced about, and ran to their father andmother; and bread and cake were thrown into the water; and they allsaid, "The new one is the most beautiful of all so young and handsome!"and the old swans bowed their heads before him.Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wings, for hedid not know what to do; he was so happy, and yet not at all proud.  Hethought how he had been persecuted and despised; and now he heard themsaying that he was the most beautiful of all birds.  Even the eldertree bent its branches straight down into the water before him, and thesun shone warm and mild.  Then his wings rustled, he lifted his slenderneck, and cried rejoicingly from the depths of his heart:"I never dreamed of so much happiness when I was the Ugly Duckling!"THE TINDER-BOXBy Hans Christian AndersenTHERE came a soldier marching along the high road-one, two!  one, two!He had his knapsack on his back and a saber by his side, for he hadbeen in the wars, and now he wanted to go home.  And on the way he metwith an old Witch: she was very hideous and her under lip hung downupon her breast.  She said: "Good evening, Soldier.  What a fine swordyou have, and what a big knapsack!  You're a proper soldier!  Now youshall have as much money as you like to have.""I thank you, you old Witch" said the Soldier."Do you see that great tree?" quoth the Witch; and she pointed to atree which stood beside them."It's quite hollow inside.  You must climb to the top, and then you'llsee a hole, through which you can let yourself down and get deep intothe tree.  I'll tie a rope round your body, so that I can pull you upagain when you call me.""What am I to do down in the tree?" asked the Soldier."Get money," replied the Witch.  "Listen to me.  When you come down tothe earth under the tree, you will find yourself in a great hall: it isquite light, for above three hundred lamps are burning there.  Then youwill see three doors; these you can open, for the keys are hangingthere.  If you go into the first chamber, you'll see a great chest inthe middle of the floor; on this chest sits a dog, and he's got a pairof eyes as big as two teacups.  But you need not care for that.  I'llgive you my blue-checked apron, and you can spread it out upon thefloor; then go up quickly and take the dog, and set him on my apron;then open the chest, and take as many shillings as you like.  They areof copper; if you prefer silver, you must go into the second chamber.But there sits a dog with a pair of eyes as big as mill wheels.  But donot you care for that.  Set him upon my apron, and take some of themoney.  And if you want gold, you can have that too-in fact, as much asyou can carry-if you go into the third chamber.  But the dog that sitson the money chest there has two eyes as big as round towers.  He is afierce dog, you may be sure; but you needn't be afraid, for all that.Only set him on my apron, and he won't hurt you; and take out of thechest as much gold as you like.""That's not so bad," said the Soldier.  "But what am I to give you, youold Witch?  for you will not do it for nothing, I fancy.""No," replied the Witch, "not a single shilling will I have.  You shallonly bring me an old Tinder-box which my grandmother forgot when shewas down there last.""Then tie the rope round my body," cried the Soldier."Here it is," said the Witch, "and here's my blue-checked apron."Then the Soldier climbed up into the tree, let himself slip down intothe hole, and stood, as the Witch had said, in the great hall where thethree hundred lamps were burning.Now he opened the first door.  Ugh!  there sat the dog with eyes as bigas teacups, staring at him."You're a nice fellow!" exclaimed the Soldier; and he set him on theWitch's apron, and took as many shillings as his pockets would hold,and then locked the chest, set the dog on it again, and went into thesecond chamber, Aha!  there sat the dog with eyes as big as millwheels."You should not stare so hard at me," said the Soldier; "you mightstrain your eyes." And he set the dog upon the Witch's apron.  And whenhe saw the silver money in the chest, he threw away all the coppermoney he had and filled his pockets and his knapsack with silver only.Then he went into the third chamber.  Oh, but that was horrid!  The dogthere really had eyes as big as towers, and they turned round and roundin his head like wheels."Good evening!" said the Soldier; and he touched his cap, for he hadnever seen such a dog as that before.  When he had looked at him alittle more closely, he thought: "That will do," and lifted him down tothe floor, and opened the chest.  Mercy!  What a quantity of gold wasthere!  He could buy with it the whole town, and the sugar sucking pigsof the cake woman, and all the tin soldiers, whips, and rocking-horsesin the whole world.  Yes, that was a quantity of money!  Now theSoldier threw away all the silver coin with which he had filled hispockets and his knapsack, and took gold instead; yes, all his pockets,his knapsack, his boots, and his cap were filled, so that he couldscarcely walk.  Now indeed he had plenty of money.  He put the dog onthe chest shut the door, and then called up through the tree: "Now pullme up, you old Witch!""Have you the Tinder-box?" asked the Witch."Plague on it!" exclaimed the Soldier, "I had clean forgotten that."And he went and brought it.The Witch drew him up, and he stood on the high road again, withpockets, boots, knapsack, and cap full of gold."What are you going to do with the Tinder-box?" asked the Soldier."That's nothing to you," retorted the Witch.  "You've had your money;just give me the Tinder-box.""Nonsense!" said the Soldier.  "Tell me directly what you're going todo with it or I'll draw my sword and cut off your head.""No!" cried the Witch.So the Soldier cut off her head.  There she lay!  But he tied up allhis money in her apron, took it on his back like a bundle, put theTinder-box in his pocket, and went straight off toward the town.That was a splendid town!  And he put up at the very best inn, andasked for the finest rooms, and ordered his favorite dishes, for now hewas rich, as he had so much money.  The servant who had to clean hisboots certainly thought them a remarkably old pair for such a richgentleman; but he had not bought any new ones yet.  The next day heprocured proper boots and handsome clothes.  Now our Soldier had becomea fine gentleman; and the people told him of all the splendid thingswhich were in their city, and about the King, and what a prettyPrincess the King's daughter was."Where can one get to see her?" asked the Soldier."She is not to be seen at all," said they all together; "she lives in agreat copper castle, with a great many walls and towers round about it:no one but the King may go in and out there, for it has been prophesiedthat she shall marry a common soldier, and the King can't bear that.""I should like to see her," thought the Soldier; but he could not getleave to do so.  Now he lived merrily, went to the theater, drove inthe King's garden, and gave much money to the poor; and this was verykind of him, for he knew from old times how hard it is when one has nota shilling.Now he was rich, had new clothes, and gained many friends, who all saidhe was a rare one, a true cavalier; and that pleased the Soldier well.But as he spent money every day and never carried any, he had at lastonly two shillings left; and he was obliged to turn out of the finerooms in which he had dwelt, and had to live in a little garret underthe roof, and clean his boots for himself, and mend them with adarning-needle.  None of his friends came to see him, for there weretoo many stairs to climb.It was quite dark one evening, and he could not even buy himself acandle, when it occurred to him that there was a candle end in theTinder-box which he had taken out of the hollow tree into which theWitch had helped him.  He brought out the Tinder-box and the candleend; but as soon as he struck fire and the sparks rose up from theflint, the door flew open, and the dog who had eyes as big as a coupleof teacups, and whom he had seen in the tree, stood before him, andsaid:"What are my lord's commands?""What is this?" said the Soldier.  "That's a famous Tinder-box, if Ican get everything with it that I want!  Bring me some money," said heto the dog; and whisk!  the dog was gone, and whisk!  he was backagain, with a great bag full of shillings in his mouth.Now the Soldier knew what a capital Tinder-box this was.  If he struckit once, the dog came who sat upon the chest of copper money; if hestruck it twice, the dog came who had the silver; and if he struck itthree times, then appeared the dog who had the gold.  Now the Soldiermoved back into the fine rooms, and appeared again in handsome clothes;and all his friends knew him again, and cared very much for him indeed.Once he thought to himself: "It is a very strange thing that one cannotget to see the Princess.  They all say she is very beautiful; but whatis the use of that, if she has always to sit in the great copper castlewith the many towers?  Can I not get to see her at all?  Where is myTinder-box?" And so he struck a light, and whisk!  came the dog witheyes as big as teacups."It is midnight, certainly," said the Soldier, "but I should very muchlike to see the Princess, only for one little moment."And the dog was outside the door directly, and, before the Soldierthought it, came back with the Princess.  She sat upon the dogs backand slept; and everyone could see she was a real Princess, for she wasso lovely.  The Soldier could not refrain from kissing her, for he wasa thorough soldier.  Then the dog ran back again with the Princess.But when morning came, and the King and Queen were drinking tea, thePrincess said she had had a strange dream the night before about a dogand a soldier-that she had ridden upon the dog, and the soldier hadkissed her."That would be a fine history!" said the Queen.So one of the old court ladies had to watch the next night by thePrincess's bed, to see if this was really a dream, or what it might be.The Soldier had a great longing to see the lovely Princess again; sothe dog came in the night, took her away, and ran as fast as he could.But the old lady put on water boots, and ran just as fast after him.When she saw that they both entered a great house, she thought: "Now Iknow where it is; and with a bit of chalk she drew a great cross on thedoor.  Then she went home and lay down, and the dog came up with thePrincess; but when he saw that there was a cross drawn on the doorwhere the Soldier lived, he took a piece of chalk too, and drew crosseson all the doors in the town.  And that was cleverly done, for now thelady could not find the right door, because all the doors had crossesupon them.In the morning early came the King and Queen, the old court lady andall the officers, to see where it was the Princess had been.  "Here itis!" said the King, when he saw the first door with a cross upon it."No, my dear husband, it is there!" said the Queen, who descriedanother door which also showed a cross.  "But there is one, and thereis one!" said all, for wherever they looked there were crosses on thedoors.  So they saw that it would avail them nothing if they searchedon.But the Queen was an exceedingly clever woman, who could do more thanride in a coach.  She took her great gold scissors, cut a piece of silkinto pieces, and made a neat little bag; this bag she filled with finewheat flour, and tied it on the Princess's back, and when that wasdone, she cut a little hole in the bag, so that the flour would bescattered along all the way which the Princess should take.In the night the dog came again, took the Princess on his back, and ranwith her to the Soldier, who loved her very much, and would gladly havebeen a prince, so that he might have her for his wife.  The dog did notnotice at all how the flour ran out in a stream from the castle to thewindows of the Soldier's house, where he ran up the wall with thePrincess.  In the morning the King and Queen saw well enough wheretheir daughter had been, and they took the Soldier and put him inprison.There he sat.  Oh, but it was dark and disagreeable there!  And theysaid to him: "To-morrow you shall be hanged."  That was not amusing tohear, and he had left his Tinder-box at the inn.  In the morning hecould see, through the iron grating of the little window, how thepeople were hurrying out of the town to see him hanged.  He heard thedrums beat and saw the soldiers marching.  All the people were runningout, and among them was the shoemaker's boy with leather apron andslippers, and he galloped so fast that one of his slippers flew off,and came right against the wall where the Soldier sat looking throughthe iron grating."Halloo, you shoemaker's boy!  you needn't be in such a hurry," criedthe Soldier to him: "it will not begin till I come.  But if you willrun to where I lived and bring me my Tinder-box, you shall have fourshillings: but you must put your best leg foremost."The shoemaker's boy wanted to get the four shillings, so he went andbrought the Tinder-box, and-well, we shall hear now what happened.Outside the town a great gallows had been built, and round it stood thesoldiers and many hundred thousand people.  The King and Queen sat on asplendid throne, opposite to the judges and the whole council.  Thesoldiers already stood upon the ladder; but as they were about to putthe rope round his neck, he said that before a poor criminal sufferedhis punishment an innocent request was always granted to him.  Hewanted very much to smoke a pipe of tobacco, and it would be the lastpipe he should smoke in the world.  The King would not say "No" tothis; so the Soldier took his Tinder-box and struck fire.  One-two-three! - and there suddenly stood all the dogs-the one with eyes as bigas teacups, the one with eyes as large as mill wheels, and the onewhose eyes were as big as round towers."Help me now, so that I may not be hanged," said the Soldier.And the dogs fell upon the judges and all the council, seized one bythe leg and another by the nose, and tossed them many feet into theair, so that they fell down and were all broken to pieces."I won't!" cried the King; but the biggest dog took him and the Queen,and threw them after the others.  Then the soldiers were afraid, andthe people cried: "Little Soldier, you shall be our king, and marry thebeautiful Princess."So they put the Soldier into the King's coach, and all the three dogsdarted on in front and cried "Hurrah!" and the boys whistled throughtheir fingers, and the soldiers presented arms.  The Princess came outof the copper castle, and became Queen, and she liked that well enough.The wedding lasted a week, and the three dogs sat at the table too, andopened their eyes wider than ever at all they saw.THE CONSTANT TIN SOLDIERBy Hans Christian AndersenTHERE were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers; they were all brothers,for they had all been born of one old tin spoon.  They shouldered theirmuskets, and looked straight before them; their uniform was red andblue, and very splendid.  The first thing they had heard in the world,when the lid was taken off the box, had been the words "Tin soldiers!"These words were tittered by a little boy, clapping his hands; thesoldiers had been given to him, for it was his birthday; and now he putthem upon the table.  Each soldier was exactly like the rest; but oneof them had been cast last of all, and there had not been enough tin tofinish him; but he stood as firmly upon his one leg as the others ontheir two; and it was just this soldier who became remarkable.On the table on which they had been placed stood many other playthings,but the toy that attracted most attention was a neat castle ofcardboard.  Through the little windows one could see straight into thehall.  Before the castle some little trees were placed round a littlelooking-glass, which was to represent a clear lake.  Waxen swans swamon this lake, and were mirrored in it.  This was all very pretty; butthe prettiest of all was a little Lady, who stood at the open door ofthe castle; she was also cut out in paper, but she had a dress of theclearest gauze, and a little narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders thatlooked like a scarf; and in the middle of this ribbon was a shiningtinsel rose, as big as her whole face.  The little Lady stretched outboth her arms, for she was a dancer, and then she lifted one leg sohigh that the Tin Soldier could not see it at all, and thought that,like himself, she had but one leg."That would be the wife for me," thought he; "but she is very grand.She lives in a castle, and I have only a box, and there are five-and-twenty of us in that.  It is no place for her.  But I must try to makeacquaintance with her."And then he lay down at full length behind a snuffbox which was on thetable; there he could easily watch the little dainty lady, whocontinued to stand on one leg without losing her balance.When the evening came, all the other tin soldiers were put into theirbox, and the people in the house went to bed.  Now the toys began toplay at "visiting," and at "war," and "giving balls."  The tin soldiersrattled in their box, for they wanted to join, but could not lift thelid.  The Nutcracker threw somersaults, and the Pencil amused itself onthe table; there was so much noise that the Canary woke up, and beganto speak too, and even in verse.  The only two who did not stir fromtheir places were the Tin Soldier and the Dancing Lady; she stoodstraight up on the point of one of her toes, and stretched out both herarms: and he was just as enduring on his one leg; and he never turnedhis eyes away from her.Now the clock struck twelve-and, bounce! -the lid flew off thesnuffbox; but there was not snuff in it, but a little black goblin; yousee, it was a trick."Tin Soldier," said the Goblin, "don't stare at things that don'tconcern you."But the Tin Soldier pretended not to hear him.  "Just you wait till to-morrow!" said the Goblin.  But when the morning came, and the childrengot up, the Tin Soldier was placed in the window; and whether it wasthe Goblin or the draft that did it, all at once the window flew open,and the Soldier fell, head over heels, out of the third story.  Thatwas a terrible passage!  He put his leg straight up, and struck withhis helmet downward, and his bayonet between the paving stones.The servant maid and the little boy came down directly to look for him,but though they almost trod upon him they could not see him.  If theSoldier had cried out, "Here I am!" they would have found him; but hedid not think it fitting to call out loudly, because he was in uniform.Now it began to rain; the drops soon fell thicker, and at last it camedown in a complete stream.  When the rain was past, two street boyscame by."Just look!" said one of them, "there lies a tin soldier.  He must comeout and ride in the boat."And they made a boat out of a newspaper, and put the Tin Soldier in themiddle of it; and so he sailed down the gutter, and the two boys ranbeside him and clapped their hands.  Goodness preserve us!  how thewaves rose in that gutter, and how fast the stream ran!  But then ithad been a heavy rain.  The paper boat rocked up and down, andsometimes turned round so rapidly that the Tin Soldier trembled; but heremained firm and never changed countenance, and looked straight beforehim, and shouldered his musket.All at once the boat went into a long drain, and it became as dark asif he had been in his box."Where am I going now?" he thought.  "Yes, yes, that's the Goblin'sfault.  Ah! if the little Lady only sat here with me in the boat, itmight be twice as dark for what I should care."Suddenly there came a great water rat, which lived under the drain."Have you a passport?" said the Rat.  "Give me your passport."But the Tin Soldier kept silence, and only held his musket tighter thanever.The boat went on, but the Rat came after it.  Hu! how he gnashed histeeth, and called out to the bits of straw and wood:"Hold him! hold him! he hasn't paid toll-he hasn't showed hispassport!"But the stream became stronger and stronger.  The Tin Soldier could seethe bright daylight where the arch ended; but he heard a roaring noise,which might well frighten a bolder man.  Only think-just where thetunnel ended the drain ran into a great canal; and for him that wouldhave been as dangerous as for us to be carried down a great waterfall.Now he was already so near it that he could not stop.  The boat wascarried out, the poor Tin Soldier stiffening himself as much as hecould, and no one could say that he moved an eyelid.  The boat whirledround three or four times, and was full of water to the very edge- itmust sink.  The Tin Soldier stood up to his neck in water, and the boatsank deeper and deeper, and the paper was loosened more and more, andnow the water closed over the Soldier's head.  Then he thought of thepretty little dancer, and how he should never see her again; and itsounded in the Soldier's ears:'Farewell, farewell, thou warrior brave,Die shalt thou this day."And now the paper parted, and the Tin Soldier fell out; but at thatmoment he was snapped up by a great fish.Oh, how dark it was in that fish's body!  It was darker yet than in thedrain tunnel; and then it was very narrow, too.  But the Tin Soldierremained unmoved, and lay at full length, shouldering his musket.The fish swam to and fro; he made the most wonderful movements, andthen became quite still.  At last something flashed through him likelightning.  The daylight shone quite clear, and a voice said aloud,"The Tin Soldier!" The fish had been caught, carried to market, bought,and taken into the kitchen, where the cook cut him open with a largeknife.  She seized the Soldier round the body with both her hands, andcarried him into the room, where all were anxious to see the remarkableman who had traveled about in the inside of a fish; but the Tin Soldierwas not at all proud.  They placed him on the table, and there-no!What curious things may happen in the world!  The Tin Soldier was inthe very room in which he had been before!  he saw the same children,and the same toys stood upon the table; and there was the pretty castlewith the graceful little Dancer.  She was still balancing herself onone leg and held the other extended in the air.  She was faithful, too.That moved the Tin Soldier: he was very near weeping tin tears, butthat would not have been proper.  He looked at her, but they saidnothing to each other.Then one of the little boys took the Tin Soldier and flung him into thestove.  He gave no reason for doing this.  It must have been the faultof the Goblin in the snuffbox.The Tin Soldier stood there quite illuminated, and felt a heat that wasterrible; but whether this heat proceeded from the real fire or fromlove he did not know.  The colors had quite gone off from him; butwhether that had happened on the journey, or had been caused by grief,no one could say.  He looked at the little Lady, she looked at him, andhe felt that he was melting; but he stood firm, shouldering his musket.Then suddenly the door flew open, and the draft of air caught theDancer, and she flew like a sylph just into the stove to the TinSoldier, and flashed up in a flame, and then was gone!  Then the TinSoldier melted down into a lump, and when the servant maid took theashes out next day, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart.But of the Dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose, and that wasburned as black as coal.THE FIR TREEBy Hans Christian AndersenOUT in the woods stood a nice little Fir tree.  The place he had was avery good one; the sun shone on him; as to fresh air, there was enoughof that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well asfirs.  But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not carefor the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when theywere in the wood looking for wild strawberries.  The children oftencame with a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of themthreaded on a straw, and sat down near the young Tree and said, "Oh,how pretty he is!  what a nice little fir!" But this was what the Treecould not bear to hear.At the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another yearhe was another long bit taller; for with fir trees one can always tellby the shoots how many years old they are."Oh, were I but such a high tree as the others are," sighed he.  "ThenI should be able to spread out my branches, and with the tops to lookinto the wide world!  Then would the birds build nests among mybranches; and when there was a breeze, I could bend with as muchstateliness as the others!"Neither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the red clouds which morningand evening sailed above him, gave the little Tree any pleasure.In winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare wouldoften come leaping along, and jump right over the little Tree.  Oh,that made him so angry!  But two winters were past, and in the thirdthe Tree was so large that the hare was obliged to go round it.  "Togrow and grow, to get older and be tall," thought the Tree-"that, afterall, is the most delightful thing in the world!"In autumn the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largesttrees.  This happened every year; and the young Fir tree, that had nowgrown to a very comely size, trembled at the sight; for the magnificentgreat trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the brancheswere lopped off, and the trees looked long and bare: they were hardlyto be recognized; and then they were laid in carts, and the horsesdragged them out of the wood.Where did they go to?  What became of them?  In spring, when theSwallows and the Storks came, the Tree asked them: "Don't you knowwhere they have been taken?  Have you not met them anywhere?"The Swallows did not know anything about it; but the Stork lookedmusing, nodded his head, and said: "Yes; I think I know; I met manyships as I was flying hither from Egypt; on the ships were magnificentmasts, and I venture to assert that it was they that smelled so of fir.I may congratulate you, for they lifted themselves on high mostmajestically!""Oh, were I but old enough to fly across the sea!  But how does the sealook in reality?  What is it like?""That would take a long time to explain," said the Stork, and withthese words off he went."Rejoice in thy growth!" said the Sunbeams, "rejoice in thy vigorousgrowth, and in the fresh life that groweth within thee!"And the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears over him; but theFir understood it not.When Christmas came, quite young trees were cut down; trees which oftenwere not even as large or of the same age as this Fir tree, who couldnever rest, but always wanted to be off.  These young trees, and theywere always the finest looking, retained their branches; they were laidon carts, and the horses drew them out of the wood."Where are they going to?" asked the Fir."They are not taller than I; there was one indeed that was considerablyshorter; -and why do they retain all their branches?  Whither are theytaken?""We know!  we know!" chirped the Sparrows.  "'We have peeped in at thewindows in the town below!  We know whither they are taken!  Thegreatest splendor and the greatest magnificence one can imagine awaitthem.  We peeped through the windows, and saw them planted in themiddle of the warm room, and ornamented with the most splendid things-with gilded apples, with gingerbread, with toys, and many hundredlights!""And then?" asked the Fir tree, trembling in every bough.  "And then?What happens then?""We did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful.""I would fain know if I am destined for so glorious a career," criedthe Tree, rejoicing.  "That is still better than to cross the sea!What a longing do I suffer!  Were Christmas but come!  I am now tall,and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year!Oh, were I but already on the cart!  Were I in the warm room with allthe splendor and magnificence!  Yes; then something better, somethingstill grander, will surely follow, or wherefore should they thusornament me?  Something better, something still grander, must follow-but what?  Oh, how I long, how I suffer!  I do not know myself what isthe matter with me!""Rejoice in our presence!" said the Air and the Sunlight; "rejoice inthy own fresh youth!"But the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was greenboth winter and summer.  People that saw him said, "What a fine tree!"and toward Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down.  The axstruck deep into the very pith; the tree fell to the earth with a sigh:he felt a pang -it was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness,for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the placewhere he had sprung up.  He well knew that he should never see his dearold comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, any more;perhaps not even the birds!  The departure was not at all agreeable.The Tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard withthe other trees, and heard a man say, "That one is splendid!  we don'twant the others."  Then two servants came in rich livery and carriedthe Fir tree into a large and splendid drawing-room.  Portraits werehanging on the walls, and near the white porcelain stove stood twolarge Chinese vases with lions on the covers.  There, too, were largeeasy-chairs, silken sofas, large tables full of picture books, and fullof toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns-at least the childrensaid so.  And the Fir tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filledwith sand: but no one could see that it was a cask, for green cloth washung all round it, and it stood on a large gayly colored carpet.  Oh,how the Tree quivered!  What was to happen?  The servants, as well asthe young ladies, decorated it.  On one branch there hung little netscut out of colored paper, and each net was filled with sugarplums; andamong the other boughs gilded apples and walnuts were suspended,looking as though they had grown there, and little blue and whitetapers were placed among the leaves.  Dolls that looked for all theworld like men -the Tree had never beheld such before-were seen amongthe foliage, and at the very top a large star of gold tinsel was fixed.It was really splendid -beyond description splendid."This evening!" said they all; "how it will shine this evening!""Oh," thought the Tree, "if the evening were but come!  If the taperswere but lighted!  And then I wonder what will happen!  Perhaps theother trees from the forest will come to look at me!  Perhaps thesparrows will beat against the windowpanes!  I wonder if I shall takeroot here, and winter and summer stand covered with ornaments!"He knew very much about the matter!  but he was so impatient that forsheer longing he got a pain in his back, and this with trees is thesame thing as a headache with us.The candles were now lighted.  What brightness!  What splendor!  TheTree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to thefoliage.  It blazed up splendidly."Help!  help!" cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out thefire.Now the Tree did not even dare tremble.  What a state he was in!  Hewas so uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendor, that hewas quite bewildered amid the glare and brightness; when suddenly bothfolding doors opened, and a troop of children rushed in as if theywould upset the Tree.  The older persons followed quietly; the littleones stood quite still.  But it was only for a moment; then theyshouted so that the whole place reechoed with their rejoicing; theydanced round the Tree, and one present after the other was pulled off."What are they about?" thought the Tree.  "What is to happen now!" Andthe lights burned down to the very branches, and as they burned downthey were put out one after the other, and then the children hadpermission to plunder the Tree.  So they fell upon it with suchviolence that all its branches cracked; if it had not been fixed firmlyin the cask, it would certainly have tumbled down.The children danced about with their beautiful playthings; no onelooked at the Tree except the old nurse, who peeped between thebranches; but it was only to see if there was a fig or an apple leftthat had been forgotten."A story!  a story!" cried the children, drawing a little fat mantoward the Tree.  He seated himself under it, and said: "Now we are inthe shade, and the Tree can listen too.  But I shall tell only onestory.  Now which will you have; that about IvedyAvedy, or aboutKlumpy-Dumpy who tumbled downstairs, and yet after all came to thethrone and married the princess?""Ivedy-Avedy," cried some; "Klumpy-Dumpy," cried the others.  There wassuch a bawling and screaming!  -the Fir tree alone was silent, and hethought to himself, "Am I not to bawl with the rest?-am I to do nothingwhatever?" for he was one of the company, and had done what he had todo.And the man told about Klumpy-Dumpy that tumbled down, whonotwithstanding came to the throne, and at last married the princess.And the children clapped their hands, arid cried out, "Oh, go on!  Dogo on!" they waited to hear about Ivedy-Avedy too, but the little manonly told them about Klumpy-Dumpy.  The Fir tree stood quite still andabsorbed in thought: the birds in the wood had never related the likeof this.  "Klumpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married theprincess!  Yes, yes!  that's the way of the world!" thought the Firtree, and believed it all, because the man who told the story was sogood-looking.  "Well, well!  who knows, perhaps I may fall downstairstoo, and get a princess as wife!"  And he looked forward with joy tothe morrow, when he hoped to be decked out again with lights, play-things, fruits, and tinsel."I won't tremble to-morrow!" thought the Fir tree.  "I will enjoy tothe full all my splendor!  To-morrow I shall hear again the story ofKlumpy-Dumpy, and perhaps that of Ivedy-Avedy too." And the whole nightthe Tree stood still and in deep thought.In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in."Now then the splendor will begin again," thought the Fir.  But theydragged him out of the room, and up the stairs into the loft; and here,in a dark corner, where no daylight could enter, they left him."What's the meaning of this?" thought the Tree.  "What am I to do here?What shall I hear now, I wonder?"  And he leaned against the wall lostin reverie.  Time enough had he too for his reflections; for days andnights passed on, and nobody came up; and when at last somebody didcome, it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way.There stood the Tree quite hidden; it seemed as if he had been entirelyforgotten."'Tis now winter out-of-doors!" thought the Tree.  "The earth is hardand covered with snow; men cannot plant me now, and therefore I havebeen put up here under shelter till the springtime comes!  Howthoughtful that is!  How kind man is, after all!  If it only were notso dark here, and so terribly lonely!  Not even a hare.  And out in thewoods it was so pleasant, when the snow was on the ground, and the hareleaped by; yes-even when he jumped over me; but I did not like it then.It is really terribly lonely here!""Squeak!  squeak!" said a little Mouse at the same moment, peeping outof his hole.  And then another little one came.  They snuffed about theFir tree, and rustled among the branches."It is dreadfully cold," said the Mouse.  "But for that, it would bedelightful here, old Fir, wouldn't it?""I am by no means old," said the Fir tree.  "There's many a oneconsiderably older than I am.""Where do you come from," asked the Mice; "and what can you do?"  Theywere so extremely curious.  "Tell us about the most beautiful spot onthe earth.  Have you never been there?  Were you never in the larder,where cheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from above; where onedances about on tallow candles; that place where one enters lean, andcomes out again fat and portly?""I know no such place," said the Tree.  "But I know the wood, where thesun shines, and where the little birds sing."  And then he told allabout his youth; and the little Mice had never heard the like before;and they listened and said:"Well, to be sure!  How much you have seen!  How happy you must havebeen!""I!" said the Fir tree, thinking over what he had himself related."Yes, in reality those were happy times."  And then he told aboutChristmas Eve, when he was decked out with cakes and candles."Oh," said the little Mice, "how fortunate you have been, old Firtree!""I am by no means old," said he.  "I came from the wood this winter; Iam in my prime, and am only rather short for my age.""What delightful stories you know!" said the Mice; and the next nightthey came with four other little Mice, who were to hear what the Treerecounted; and the more he related, the more plainly he remembered allhimself; and it appeared as if those times had really been happy times."But they may still come-they may still come.  Humpy-Dumpy felldownstairs, and yet he got a princess!" and he thought at the moment ofa nice little Birch tree growing out in the woods; to the Fir, thatwould be a real charming princess."Who is Klumpy-Dumpy?" asked the Mice.  So then the Fir tree told thewhole fairy tale, for he could remember every single word of it; andthe little Mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the Tree.  Nextnight two more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats, even; but they saidthe stories were not interesting, which vexed the little Mice; andthey, too, now began to think them not so very amusing either."Do you know only one story?" asked the Rats."Only that one," answered the Tree.  "I heard it on my happiestevening; but I did not then know how happy I was.""It is a very stupid story!  Don't you know one about bacon and tallowcandles?  Can't you tell any larder stories?""No," said the Tree."Then good-by," said the Rats and they went home.At last the little Mice stayed away also; and the Tree sighed: "Afterall, it was very pleasant when the sleek little Mice sat round me andlistened to what I told them.  Now that too is over.  But I will takegood care to enjoy myself when I am brought out again."But when was that to be?  Why, one morning there came a quantity ofpeople and set to work in the loft.  The trunks were moved, the treewas pulled out and thrown-rather hard, it is true- down on the floor,but a man drew him toward the stairs, where the daylight shone."Now a merry life will begin again," thought the Tree.  He felt thefresh air, the first sunbeam- and now he was out in the courtyard.  Allpassed so quickly, there was so much going on around him, that the Treequite forgot to look to himself.  The court adjoined a garden, and allwas in flower; the roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade,the lindens were in blossom, the Swallows flew by, and said "Quirre-vit!  my husband is come!" but it was not the Fir tree that they meant."Now, then, I shall really enjoy life," said he, exultingly, and spreadout his branches; but, alas!  they were all withered and yellow.  Itwas in a corner that he lay, among weeds and nettles.  The golden starof tinsel was still on the top of the Tree, and glittered in thesunshine.In the courtyard some of the merry children were playing who had dancedat Christmas round the Fir tree, and were so glad at the sight of him.One of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star."Only look what is still on the ugly old Christmas tree!" said he,trampling on the branches, so that they all cracked beneath his feet.And the Tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers, and the freshness inthe garden; he beheld himself, and wished he had remained in his darkcorner in the loft: he thought of his first youth in the wood, of theMerry Christmas Eve, and of the little Mice who had listened with somuch pleasure to the story of Humpy-Dumpy."'Tis over-'tis past!" said the poor Tree.  "Had I but rejoiced when Ihad reason to do so!  But now 'tis past, 'tis past!"And the gardener's boy chopped the Tree into small pieces; there was awhole heap lying there.  The wood flamed up splendidly under the largebrewing copper, and it sighed so deeply!  Each sigh was like a shot.The boys played about in the court, and the youngest wore the gold staron his breast which the Tree had had on the happiest evening of hislife.  However, that was over now-the Tree gone, the story at an end.All, all was over; every tale must end at last.THE FLYING TRUNKBy Hans Christian AndersenTHERE was once a merchant, who was so rich that he could pave the wholestreet with gold, and almost have enough left for a little lane.  Buthe did not do that; he knew how to employ his money differently.  Whenhe spent a shilling he got back a crown, such a clever merchant was he;and this continued till he died.His son now got all this money; and he lived merrily, going to themasquerade every evening, making kites out of dollar notes, and playingat ducks and drakes on the seacoast with gold pieces instead ofpebbles.  In this way the money might soon be spent, and indeed it wasso.  At last he had no more than four shillings left, and no clothes towear but a pair of slippers and an old dressing gown.Now his friends did not trouble themselves any more about him as theycould not walk with him in the street, but one of them, who was good-natured, sent him an old trunk, with the remark:  "Pack up!"  Yes, thatwas all very well, but he had nothing to pack, therefore he seatedhimself in the trunk.That was a wonderful trunk.  So soon as any one pressed the lock thetrunk could fly.  He pressed it, and whirr!  away flew the trunk withhim through the chimney and over the clouds farther and farther away.But as often as the bottom of the trunk cracked a little he was ingreat fear lest it might go to pieces, and then he would have flung afine somersault!  In that way he came to the land of the Turks.  He hidthe trunk in a wood under some dry leaves, and then went into the town.He could do that very well, for among the Turks all the people wentabout dressed like himself in dressing gown and slippers.  Then he meta nurse with a little child."Here, you Turkish nurse," he began, "what kind of a great castle isthat close by the town, in which the windows are so high up?""There dwells the Sultan's daughter," replied she.  "It is prophesiedthat she will be very unhappy respecting a lover; and therefore nobodymay go near her, unless the Sultan and Sultana are there too.""Thank you!" said the Merchant's Son; and he went out into the forest,seated himself in his trunk, flew on the roof, and crept through thewindow into the Princess's room.She was lying asleep on the sofa, and she was so beautiful that theMerchant's Son was compelled to kiss her.  Then she awoke, and wasstartled very much; but he said he was a Turkish angel who had comedown to her through the air, and that pleased her.They sat down side by side, and he told her stories about her eyes; andhe told her they were the most glorious dark lakes, and that thoughtswere swimming about in them like mermaids.  And he told her about herforehead; that it was a snowy mountain with the most splendid halls andpictures.  And he told her about the stork who brings the lovely littlechildren.Yes, those were fine histories!  Then he asked the Princess if shewould marry him, and she said, "Yes," directly."But you must come here on Saturday," said she.  "Then the Sultan andSultana will be here to tea.  They will be very proud that I am tomarry a Turkish angel.  But take care that you know a very prettystory, for both my parents are very fond indeed of stories.  My motherlikes them high-flown and moral, but my father likes them merry, sothat one can laugh.""Yes, I shall bring no marriage gift but a story," said he; and so theyparted.  But the Princess gave him a saber, the sheath embroidered withgold pieces and that was very useful to him.Now he flew away, bought a new dressing gown, and sat in the forest andmade up a story; it was to be ready by Saturday, and that was not aneasy thing.By the time he had finished it Saturday had come.  The Sultan and hiswife and all the court were at the 'Princess's to tea.  He was receivedvery graciously."Will you relate us a story?" said the Sultana; "one that is deep andedifying.""Yes, but one that we can laugh at," said the Sultan."Certainly," he replied; and so began.  And now listen well."There was once a bundle of Matches, and these Matches wereparticularly proud of their high descent.  Their genealogical tree,that is to say, the great fir tree of which each of them was a littlesplinter, had been a great old tree out in the forest.  The Matches nowlay between a Tinder-box and an old Iron Pot; and they were tellingabout the days of their youth.  'Yes, when we were upon the greenboughs,' they said, 'then we really were upon the green boughs!  Everymorning and evening there was diamond tea for us-I mean dew; we hadsunshine all day long whenever the sun shone, and all the little birdshad to tell stories.  We could see very well that we were rich, for theother trees were only dressed out in summer, while our family had themeans to wear green dresses in the winter as well.  But then thewoodcutter came, like a great revolution, and our family was broken up.The head of the family got an appointment as mainmast in a first-rateship, which could sail round the world if necessary; the other brancheswent to other places, and now we have the office of kindling a lightfor the vulgar herd.  That's how we grand people came to be in thekitchen.'"'My fate was of different kind,' said the Iron Pot, which stood nextto the Matches.  'From the beginning, ever since I came into the world,there has been a great deal of scouring and cooking done in me.  I lookafter the practical part, and am the first here in the house.  My onlypleasure is to sit in my place after dinner, very clean and neat, andto carry on a sensible conversation with my comrades.  But except theWaterpot, which is sometimes taken down into the courtyard, we alwayslive within our four walls.  Our only newsmonger is the Market Basket;but he speaks very uneasily about the government and the people.  Yes,the other day there was an old pot that fell down, from fright, andburst.  He's liberal, I can tell you!'- 'Now you're talking too much,'the Tinder-box interrupted, and the steel struck against the flint, sothat sparks flew out.  'Shall we not have a merry evening?'"'Yes, let us talk about who is the grandest,' said the Matches."'No, I don't like to talk about myself,' retorted the Pot. 'Let us getup an evening entertainment.  I will begin.  I will tell a story fromreal life, something that everyone has experienced, so that we caneasily imagine the situation, and take pleasure in it.   On the Baltic,by the Danish shore-'"'That's a pretty beginning!' cried all the Plates.  'That will be astory we shall like.'"'Yes, it happened to me in my youth, when I lived in a family wherethe furniture was polished, the floors scoured, and new curtains wereput up every fortnight.'"'What an interesting way you have of telling a story!' said the CarpetBroom.  'One can tell directly that a man is speaking who has been inwoman's society.  There's something pure runs through it.'"And the Pot went on telling the story, and the end was as good as thebeginning."All the Plates rattled with joy, and the Carpet Broom brought somegreen parsley out of the dust hole, and put it like a wreath on thePot, for he knew that it would vex the others.  'If I crown him to-day,' it thought, 'he will crown me tomorrow.'"'Now I'll dance,' said the Fire Tongs; and they danced.  Preserve us!how that implement could lift up one leg!  The old chair-cushion burstto see it.  'Shall I be crowned too?' thought the Tongs; and indeed awreath was awarded."'They're only common people, after all!' thought the Matches."Now the Tea Urn was to sing; but she said she had taken cold and couldnot sing unless she felt boiling within.  But that was onlyaffectation: she did not want to sing, except when she was in theparlor with the grand people."In the window sat an old Quill Pen, with which the maid generallywrote: there was nothing remarkable about this pen, except that it hadbeen dipped too deep into the ink, but she was proud of that.  'If theTea Urn won't sing,' she said, 'she may leave it alone.  Outside hangsa nightingale in a cage, and he can sing.  He hasn't had any education,but this evening we'll say nothing about that.'"'I think it very wrong,' said the Teakettle- he was the kitchensinger, and half brother to the Tea Urn-'that that rich and foreignbird should be listened to.  Is that patriotic?  Let the Market Basketdecide.'"'I am vexed,' said the Market Basket.  'No one can imagine how much Iam secretly vexed.  Is that a proper way of spending the evening?Would it not be more sensible to put the house in order?  Let each onego to his own place, and I will arrange the whole game.  That would bequite another thing.''Yes, let us make a disturbance, cried they all.  Then the door opened,and the maid came in, and they all stood still; not one stirred.  Butthere was not one pot among them who did not know what he could do andhow grand he was.  'Yes, if I had liked,' each one thought, 'it mighthave been a very merry evening.'"The servant girl took the Matches and lighted the fire with them.mercy!  how they sputtered and burst out into flame! 'Now everyone cansee,' thought they, 'that we are the first.  How we shine!  what alight!'-and they burned out.""That was a capital story," said the Sultana.  "I feel myself quitecarried away to the kitchen, to the Matches.  Yes, now thou shalt marryour daughter.""Yes, certainly," said the Sultan, "thou shalt marry our daughter onMonday."And they called him thou, because he was to belong to the family.The wedding was decided on, and on the evening before it the whole citywas illuminated.  Biscuits and cakes were thrown among the people, thestreet boys stood on their toes, called out "Hurrah!" and whistled ontheir fingers.  It was uncommonly splendid."Yes, I shall have to give something as a treat," thought theMerchant's Son.  So he bought rockets and crackers, and everyimaginable sort of fire-work, put them all into his trunk, and flew upinto the air."Crack!" how they went, and how they went off!  All the Turks hopped upwith such a start that their slippers flew about their ears; such ameteor they had never yet seen.  Now they could understand that it mustbe a Turkish angel who was going to marry the Princess.What stories people tell!  Everyone whom he asked about it had seen itin a separate way; but one and all thought it fine."I saw the Turkish angel himself," said one.  "He had eyes like glowingstars, and a beard like foaming water.""He flew up in a fiery mantle," said another; "the most lovely littlecherub peeped forth from among the folds."Yes, they were wonderful things that he heard; and on the following dayhe was to be married.Now he went back to the forest to rest himself in his trunk.  But whathad become of that?  A spark from the fireworks had set fire to it, andthe trunk was burned to ashes.  He could not fly any more, and couldnot get to his bride.She stood all day on the roof waiting; and most likely she is waitingstill.  But he wanders through the world, telling fairy tales; but theyare not so merry as that one he told about the Matches.THE DARNING NEEDLEBy Hans Christian AndersenTHERE was once a darning needle, who thought herself so fine, sheimagined she was an embroidery needle."Take care, and mind you hold me tight!" she said to the Fingers thattook her out.  "Don't let me fall!  If I fall on the ground I shallcertainly never be found again, for I am so fine!""That's as it may be," said the Fingers; and they grasped her round thebody."See, I'm coming with a train!" said the Darning Needle, and she drew along thread after her, but there was no knot in the thread.The Fingers pointed the needle just at the cook's slipper, in which theupper leather had burst, and was to be sewn together."That's vulgar work," said the Darning Needle.  "I shall never getthrough.  I'm breaking!  I'm breaking!" And she really broke.  "Did Inot say so?" said the Darning Needle; "I'm too fine!""Now it's quite useless," said the Fingers; but they were obliged tohold her fast, all the same; for the cook dropped some sealing wax uponthe needle, and pinned her handkerchief together with it in front."So, now I'm a breastpin!" said the Darning Needle.  "I knew very wellthat I should come to honor: when one is something, one comes tosomething!"And she laughed quietly to herself-and one can never see when a darningneedle laughs.  There she sat, as proud as if she was in a state coach,and looked all about her."May I be permitted to ask if you are of gold?" she inquired of thepin, her neighbor.  "You have a very pretty appearance, and a peculiarhead, but it is only little.  You must take pains to grow, for it's noteveryone that has sealing wax dropped upon him."And the Darning Needle drew herself up so proudly that she fell out ofthe handkerchief right into the sink, which the cook was rinsing out."Now we're going on a journey," said the Darning Needle.  "If I onlydon't get lost!"But she really was lost."I'm too fine for this world," she observed, as she lay in the gutter."But I know who I am, and there's always something in that!"So the Darning Needle kept her proud behavior, and did not lose hergood humor.  And things of many kinds swam over her, chips and strawsand pieces of old newspapers."Only look how they sail!" said the Darning Needle.  "They don't knowwhat is under them!  I'm here, I remain firmly here.  See, there goes achip thinking of nothing in the world but of himself-of a chip!There's a straw going by now.  How he turns!  how he twirls about!Don't think only of yourself, you might easily run up against a stone.There swims a bit of newspaper.  What's written upon it has long beenforgotten, and yet it gives itself airs.  I sit quietly and patientlyhere.  I know who I am, and I shall remain what I am."One day something lay close beside her that glittered splendidly; thenthe Darning Needle believed that it was a diamond; but it was a bit ofbroken bottle; and because it shone, the Darning Needle spoke to it,introducing herself as a breastpin."I suppose you are a diamond?" she observed."Why, yes, something of that kind."And then each believed the other to be a very valuable thing; and theybegan speaking about the world, and how very conceited it was."I have been in a lady's box," said the Darning Needle, "and this ladywas a cook.  She had five fingers on each hand, and I never sawanything so conceited as those five fingers.  And yet they were onlythere that they might take me out of the box and put me back into it.""Were they of good birth?" asked the Bit of Bottle."No, indeed," cried the Darning Needle, "but very haughty.  There werefive brothers, all of the finger family.  They kept very proudlytogether, though they were of different lengths: the outermost, thethumbling, was short and fat; he walked out in front of the ranks, andonly had one joint in his back, and could only make a single bow; buthe said that if he were hacked off a man, that man was useless forservice in war.  Daintymouth, the second finger, thrust himself intosweet and sour, pointed to sun and moon, and gave the impression whenthey wrote.  Longrnan, the third, looked at all the others over hisshoulder.  Goldborder, the fourth, went about with a golden belt roundhis waist; and little Playman did nothing at all, and was proud of it.There was nothing but bragging among them, and therefore I went away.""And now we sit here and glitter!" said the Bit of Bottle.At that moment more water came into the gutter, so that it overflowed,and the Bit of Bottle was carried away."So he is disposed of," observed the Darning Needle.  "I remain here, Iam too fine.  But that's my pride, and my pride is honorable."  Andproudly she sat there, and had many great thoughts.  "I could almostbelieve I had been born of a sunbeam, I'm so fine!  It really appearsas if the sunbeams were always seeking for me under the water.  Ah!I'm so fine that my mother cannot find me.  If I had my old eye, whichbroke off, I think I should cry; but, no, I should not do that: it'snot genteel to cry."One day a couple of street boys lay grubbing in the gutter where theysometimes find old nails, farthings, and similar treasures.  It wasdirty work, but they took great delight in it."Oh!" cried one, who had pricked himself with the Darning Needle,there's a fellow for you!""I'm not a fellow; I'm a young lady!" said the Darning Needle.But nobody listened to her.  The sealing wax had come off, and she hadturned black; but black makes one look slender, and she thought herselffiner even than before."Here comes an eggshell sailing along!" said the boys; and they stuckthe Darning Needle fast in the eggshell."White walls, and black myself!  that looks well," remarked the DarningNeedle.  "Now one can see me.  I only hope I shall not be seasick!"But she was not seasick at all.  "It is good against seasickness, ifone has a steel stomach, and does not forget that one is a little morethan an ordinary person!  Now my seasickness is over.  The finer oneis, the more one can bear.""Crack!" went the eggshell, for a wagon went over her."Good heavens, how it crushes one!" said the Darning Needle.  "I'mgetting seasick now-I'm quite sick."But she was not really sick, though the wagon went over her; she laythere at full length, and there she may lie.PEN AND INKSTANDBy Hans Christian AndersenTHE following remark was made in a poet's room, as the speaker lookedat the inkstand that stood upon his table:"It is marvelous all that can come out of that ink-stand!  What will itproduce next?  Yes, it is marvelous!""So it is!" exclaimed the Inkstand.  "It is incomprehensible!  That iswhat I always say."  It was thus the Inkstand addressed itself to thePen, and to everything else that could hear it on the table.  "It isreally astonishing all that can come from me!  It is almost incredible!I positively do not know myself what the next thing may be, when aperson begins to dip into me.  One drop of me serves for half a side ofpaper; and what may not then appear upon it?  I am certainly somethingextraordinary.  From me proceed all the works of the poets.  Theseanimated beings, whom people think they recognize-these deep feelings,that gay humor, these charming descriptions of nature -I do notunderstand them myself, for I know nothing about nature; but still itis all in me.  From me have gone forth, and still go forth, thesewarrior hosts, these lovely maidens, these bold knights on snortingsteeds, those droll characters in humbler life.  The fact is, however,that I do not know anything about them myself.  I assure you they arenot my ideas.""You are right there," replied the Pen.  "You have few ideas, and donot trouble yourself much with thinking, if you did exert yourself tothink, you would perceive that you ought to give something that was notdry.  You supply me with the means of committing to paper what I havein me; I write with that.  It is the pen that writes.  Mankind do notdoubt that; and most men have about as much genius for poetry as an oldinkstand.""You have but little experience," said the ink-stand.  "You havescarcely been a week in use, and you are already half worn out.  Do youfancy that you are a poet?  You are only a servant: and I have had manyof your kind before you came- many of the goose family, and of Englishmanufacture.  I know both quill pens and steel pens.  I have had agreat many in my service, and I shall have many more still, when he,the man who stirs me up, comes and puts down what he takes from me.  Ishould like very much to know what will be the next thing he will takefrom me.""Ink tub!" said the Pen.Late in the evening the Poet returned home.  He had been at a concert,had heard a celebrated violin player, and was quite enchanted with hiswonderful performance.  It had been a complete gush of melody that hehad drawn from the instrument.  Sometimes it seemed like the gentlemurmur of a rippling stream, sometimes like the singing of birds,sometimes like the tempest sweeping through the mighty pine forests, hefancied he heard his own heart weep, but in the sweet tones that can beheard in a woman's charming voice.  It seemed as if not only thestrings of the violin made music, but its bridge, its pegs, and itssounding board.  It was astonishing!  The piece had been a mostdifficult one; but it seemed like play-as if the bow were but wanderingcapriciously over the strings.  Such was the appearance of facility,that everyone might have supposed he could do it.  The violin seemed tosound of itself, the bow to play of itself.  These two seemed to do itall.  One forgot the master who guided them, who gave them life andsoul.  Yes, they forgot the master; but the Poet thought of him.  Henamed him, and wrote down his thoughts as follows:"How foolish it would be of the violin and the bow, were they to bevain in their performance!  And yet this is what so often we of thehuman species are.  Poets, artists, those who make discoveries inscience, military and naval commanders -we are all proud of ourselves;and yet we are all only the instruments in our Lord's hands.  To Himalone be the glory!  We have nothing to arrogate to ourselves."This was what the Poet wrote; and he headed it with: "The Master andthe Instruments.""Well, madam," said the Pen to the Inkstand when they were again alone,"you heard him read aloud what I had written.""Yes, what I gave you to write," said the Ink-stand.  "It was a hit atyou for your conceit.  Strange that you cannot see that people make afool of you!  I gave you that hit pretty cleverly.  I confess, though,it was rather malicious.""Inkholder!" cried the Pen."Writing stick!" cried the Inkstand.They both felt assured that they had answered well; and it is apleasant reflection that one has made a smart reply-one sleepscomfortably after it.  And they both went to sleep; but the Poet couldnot sleep.  His thoughts welded forth like the tones from the violin,trilling like pearls, rushing like a storm through the forest.  Herecognized the feeling of his own heart-he perceived the gleam from theeverlasting Master.To Him alone be the glory!CINDERELLARetold by Miss MulockTHERE was once an honest gentleman who took for his second wife a lady,the proudest and most disagreeable in the whole country.  She had twodaughters exactly like herself in all things.  He also had one littlegirl, who resembled her dead mother, the best woman in all the world.Scarcely had the second marriage taken place, than the stepmotherbecame jealous of the good qualities of the little girl who was sogreat a contrast to her own two daughters.  She gave her all the menialoccupations of the house; compelled her to wash the floors andstaircases; to dust the bedrooms, and clean the grates; and while hersisters occupied carpeted chambers hung with mirrors, where they couldsee themselves from head to foot, this poor little damsel was sent tosleep in an attic, on an old straw mattress, with only one chair andnot a looking-glass in the room.She suffered all in silence, not daring to complain to her father, whowas entirely ruled by his new wife.  When her daily work was done, sheused to sit down in the chimney corner among the ashes; from which thetwo sisters gave her the nickname of Cinderella.  But Cinderella,however, shabbily clad, was handsomer than they were with all theirfine clothes.It happened that the king's son gave a series of balls, to which wereinvited all the rank and fashion of the city, and among the rest thetwo elder sisters.  They were very proud and happy, and occupied theirwhole time in deciding what they should wear; a source of new troubleto Cinderella, whose duty it was to get up their fine linen and laces,and who never could please them however much she tried.  They talked ofnothing but their clothes."I," said the elder, "shall wear my velvet gown and my trimmings ofEnglish lace.""And I," added the younger, "will have but my ordinary silk petticoat,but I shall adorn it with an upper skirt of flowered brocade, and shallput on my diamond tiara, which is a great deal finer than anything ofyours."Here the elder sister grew angry, and the dispute began to run so highthat Cinderella, who was known to have excellent taste, was called uponto decide between them.  She gave them the best advice she could, andgently and submissively offered to dress them herself, and especiallyto arrange their hair, an accomplishment in which she excelled many anoted coiffeur.  The important evening came, and she exercised all herskill to adorn the two young ladies.  While she was combing out theelder's hair, this ill-natured girl said sharply, "Cinderella, do younot wish you were going to the ball?""Ah, madam" (they obliged her always to say madam), "you are onlymocking me; it is not my fortune to have any such pleasure.""You are right; people would only laugh to see a little cinder wench ata ball."Any other than Cinderella would have dressed the hair all awry, but shewas good, and dressed it perfectly even and smooth, and as prettily asshe could.The sisters had scarcely eaten for two days, and had broken a dozenstaylaces a day, in trying to make themselves slender; but to-nightthey broke a dozen more, and lost their tempers over and over againbefore they had completed their toilet.  When at last the happy momentarrived, Cinderella followed them to the coach; after it had whirledthem away, she sat down by the kitchen fire and cried.Immediately her godmother, who was a fairy, appeared beside her.  "Whatare you crying for, my little maid?""Oh, I wish-I wish-"  Her sobs stopped her."You wish to go to the ball; isn't it so? "Cinderella nodded."Well then, be a good girl, and you shall go.  First run into thegarden and fetch me the largest pumpkin you can find."Cinderella did not comprehend what this had to do with her going to theball, but being obedient and obliging, she went.  Her godmother tookthe pumpkin, and having scooped out all its inside, struck it with herwand; it became a splendid gilt coach, lined with rose-colored satin."Now fetch me the mousetrap out of the pantry, my dear."Cinderella brought it; it contained six of the fattest, sleekest mice.The fairy lifted up the wire door, and as each mouse ran out she struckit and changed it into a beautiful black horse."But what shall I do for your coachman, Cinderella?"Cinderella suggested that she had seen a large black rat in the rattrap, and he might do for want of better."You are right; go and look again for him."He was found; and the fairy made him into a most respectable coachman,with the finest whiskers imaginable.  She afterward took six lizardsfrom behind the pumpkin frame, and changed them into six footmen, allin splendid livery, who immediately jumped up behind the carriage, asif they had been footmen all their days.  "Well, Cinderella, now youcan go to the ball.""What, in these clothes?" said Cinderella piteously, looking down onher ragged frock.Her godmother laughed, and touched her also with the wand; at which herwretched threadbare jacket became stiff with gold, and sparkling withjewels; her woolen petticoat lengthened into a gown of sweeping satin,from underneath which peeped out her little feet, no longer bare, butcovered with silk stockings, and the prettiest glass slippers in theworld.  "Now, Cinderella, depart; but remember, if you stay one instantafter midnight, your carriage will become a pumpkin, your coachman arat, your horses mice, and your footmen lizards; while you, yourself,will be the little cinder wench you were an hour ago."Cinderella promised without fear, her heart was so full of joy.Arrived at the palace, the king's son, whom some one, probably thefairy, had told to await the coming of an uninvited princess, whomnobody knew, was standing at the entrance, ready to receive her.  Heoffered her his hand, and led her with the utmost courtesy through theassembled guests, who stood aside to let her pass, whispering to oneanother, "Oh, how beautiful she is!"  It might have turned the head ofanyone but poor Cinderella, who was so used to be despised, that shetook it all as if it were something happening in a dream.Her triumph was complete; even the old king said to the queen, thatnever since her majesty's young days had he seen so charming andelegant a person.  All the court ladies scanned her eagerly, clothesand all, determining to have theirs made next day of exactly the samepattern.  The king's son himself led her out to dance, and she dancedso gracefully that he admired her more and more.  Indeed, at supper,which was fortunately early, his admiration quite took away hisappetite.  For Cinderella, herself, with an involuntary shyness, soughtout her sisters; placed herself beside them and offered them all sortsof civil attentions, which coming as they supposed from a stranger, andso magnificent a lady, almost overwhelmed them with delight.While she was talking with them, she heard the clock strike a quarterto twelve, and making a courteous adieu to the royal family, shereentered her carriage, escorted tenderly by the king's son, andarrived in safety at her own door.  There she found her godmother, whosmiled approval; and of whom she begged permission to go to a secondball, the following night, to which the queen had earnestly invitedher.While she was talking, the two sisters were heard knocking at the gate,and the fairy godmother vanished, leaving Cinderella sitting in thechimney corner, rubbing her eves and pretending to be very sleepy."Ah," cried the eldest sister maliciously, "it has been the mostdelightful ball, and there was present the most beautiful princess Iever saw, who was so exceedingly polite to us both.""Was she?" said Cinderella indifferently; "and who might she be?""Nobody knows, though everybody would give their eyes to know,especially the king's Son.""Indeed!" replied Cinderella, a little more interested; "I should liketo see her.  Miss Javotte"- that was the elder sister's name-"will younot let me go to-morrow, and lend me your yellow gown that you wear onSundays?""What, lend my yellow gown to a cinder wench!  I am not so mad asthat;" at which refusal Cinderella did not complain, for if her sisterreally had lent her the gown, she would have been considerablyembarrassed.The next night came, and the two young ladies, richly dressed indifferent toilets, went to the ball.Cinderella, more splendidly attired and beautiful than ever, followedthem shortly after.  "Now remember twelve o'clock," was her godmother'sparting speech; and she thought she certainly should.  But the prince'sattentions to her were greater even than the first evening, and in thedelight of listening to his pleasant conversation, time slipped byunperceived.  While she was sitting beside him in a lovely alcove, andlooking at the moon from under a bower of orange blossoms, she heard aclock strike the first stroke of twelve.  She started up, and fled awayas lightly as a deer.Amazed, the prince followed, but could not catch her.  Indeed he missedhis lovely princess altogether, and only saw running out of the palacedoors, a little dirty lass whom he had never beheld before, and of whomhe certainly would never have taken the least notice.  Cinderellaarrived at home breathless and weary, ragged and cold, withoutcarriage, or footman or coachman; the only remnant of her pastmagnificence being one of her little glass slippers-the other she haddropped in the ballroom as she ran away.When the two sisters returned, they were full of this strangeadventure, how the beautiful lady had appeared at the ball morebeautiful than ever, and enchanted everyone who looked at her; and howas the clock was striking twelve she had suddenly risen up and fledthrough the ballroom, disappearing no one knew how or where, anddropping one of her glass slippers behind her in her flight.  How theking's son had remained inconsolable, until he chanced to pick up thelittle glass slipper, which he carried away in his pocket, and was seento take it out continually, and look at it affectionately, with the airof a man very much in love; in fact, from his behavior during theremainder of the evening, all the court and royal family were convincedthat he had become desperately enamored of the wearer of the littleglass slipper.Cinderella listened in silence, turning her face to the kitchen fire,and perhaps it was that which made her look so rosy, but nobody evernoticed or admired her at home, so it did not signify, and next morningshe went to her weary work again just as before.A few days after, the whole city was attracted by the sight of a heraldgoing round with a little glass slipper in his hand, publishing with aflourish of trumpets, that the king's son ordered this to be fitted onthe foot of every lady in the kingdom, and that he wished to marry thelady whom it fitted best, or to whom it and the fellow slipperbelonged.  Princesses, duchesses, countesses, and simple gentlewomenall tried it on, but being a fairy slipper, it fitted nobody; andbesides, nobody could produce its fellow slipper, which lay all thetime safely in the pocket of Cinderella's old linsey gown.At last the herald came to the house of the two sisters, and thoughthey well knew neither of themselves was the beautiful lady, they madeevery attempt to get their clumsy feet into the glass slipper, but invain."Let me try it on," said Cinderella from the chimney corner."What, you?" cried the others, bursting into shouts of laughter; butCinderella only smiled, and held out her hand.Her sisters cou1d not prevent her, since the command was that everyyoung maiden in the city should try on the slipper, in order that nochance might be left untried, for the prince was nearly breaking hisheart; and his father and mother were afraid that though a prince, hewould actually die for love of the beautiful unknown lady.So the herald bade Cinderella sit down on a three-legged stool in thekitchen, and himself put the slipper on her pretty little foot, whichit fitted exactly; she then drew from her pocket the fellow slipper,which she also put on, and stood up-for with the touch of the magicshoes all her dress was changed likewise-no longer the poor despisedcinder wench, but the beautiful lady whom the king's son loved.Her sisters recognized her at once.  Filled with astonishment, mingledwith no little alarm, they threw themselves at her feet, begging herpardon for all their former unkindness.  She raised and embraced them;told them she forgave them with all her heart, and only hoped theywould love her always.  Then she departed with the herald to the king'spalace, and told her whole story to his majesty and the royal family,who were not in the least surprised, for everybody believed in fairies,and everybody longed to have a fairy godmother.For the young prince, he found her more lovely and lovable than ever,and insisted upon marrying her immediately.  Cinderella never went homeagain, but she sent for her two sisters to the palace, and with theconsent of all parties married them shortly after to two rich gentlemenof the court.LITTLE RED RIDING-HOODBy Charles PerraultONCE upon a time there lived in a certain village a little countrygirl, the prettiest creature ever seen.  Her mother was very fond ofher, and her grandmother doted on her still more.  This good woman hadmade for her a little red riding-hood, which became the girl so wellthat everybody called her Little Red Riding-Hood.One day her mother, having made some custards, said to her:"Go, my dear, and see how thy grandmamma does, for I hear she has beenvery ill; carry her a custard and this little pot of butter."Little Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother,who lived in another village.As she was going through the wood she met with Gaffer Wolf, who had avery great mind to eat her up, but he durst not, because of some fagotmakers hard by in the forest.  He asked her whither she was going.  Thepoor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stop and listento a wolf, said to him:"I am going to see my grandmamma and carry her a custard and a littlepot of butter from my mamma.""Does she live far off?" said the Wolf."Oh!  yes," answered Little Red Riding-Hood; "it is beyond that millyou see there, at the first house in the village.""Well," said the Wolf, "I'll go and see her, too.  I'll go this way andyou go that, and we shall see who will be there soonest."The Wolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the nearest way, andthe little girl went by the longest, diverting herself in gatheringnuts, running after butterflies, and making nosegays of such littleflowers as she met with.  The Wolf was not long before he got to theold woman's house.  He knocked at the door-tap, tap."Who's there?""Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood," replied the Wolf, imitatingher voice; "who has brought you a custard and a little pot of buttersent you by mamma."The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was ill, cried out:"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and he fell upon thegood woman and ate her up in a moment, for it was above three days thathe had not touched a bit.  He then shut the door and went into thegrandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding-Hood, who came some timeafterward and knocked at the door-tap, tap."Who's there?"Little Red Riding-Hood, hearing the big voice of the Wolf, was at firstafraid; but believing her grandmother had got a cold and was hoarse,answered:'Tis your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood, who has brought you acustard and a little pot of butter mamma sends you."The Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could:"Pull the bobbin and the latch will go up."Little Red Riding-Hood pulled the bobbin and the door opened.The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under thebedclothes:"Put the custard and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and comeand lie down with me."Little Red Riding-Hood undressed herself and went into bed, where,being greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, she said to her:"Grandmamma, what great arms you've got!""That is the better to hug thee, my dear.""Grandmamma, what great legs you've got!""The better to run, my child.""Grandmamma, what great ears you've got!""The better to hear, my child!""Grandmamma, what great eyes you've got!""The better to see, my child.""Grandmamma, what great teeth you've got!""To eat thee up!"And saying these words, the wicked Wolf fell upon Little Red Riding-Hood and ate her all up.THE STORY OF THE THREE BEARSBy Robert SoutheyONCE upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a houseof their own in a wood.  One of them was a Little, Small, Wee Bear; andone was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great, Huge Bear.They had each a pot for their porridge, a little pot for the Little,Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized pot for the Middle Bear; and agreat pot for the Great, Huge Bear.  And they had each a chair to sitin: a little chair for the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sizedchair for the Middle Bear; and a great chair for the Great, Huge Bear.And they had each a bed to sleep in: a little bed for the Little,Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle Bear; and agreat bed for the Great, Huge Bear.One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast andpoured it into their porridge pots, they walked out into the wood whilethe porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths bybeginning too soon to eat it.  And while they were walking a little oldwoman came to the house.  She could not have been a good, honest, oldwoman; for, first, she looked in at the window, and then she peeped inat the keyhole, and, seeing nobody in the house, she lifted the latch.The door was not fastened, because the bears were good bears, who didnobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them.  Sothe little old woman opened the door and went in; and well pleased shewas when she saw the porridge on the table.  If she had been a goodlittle old woman she would have waited till the bears came home, andthen, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast, for they weregood hears-a little rough or so, as the manner of bear's is, but forall that very good-natured and hospitable.  But she was an impudent,bad old woman, and set about helping herself.So first she tasted the porridge of the Great Huge Bear, and that wastoo hot for her; and she said a bad word about that.  And then shetasted the porridge of the Middle Bear, and that was too cold for her;and she said a bad word about that, too.  And then she went to theporridge of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and tasted that, and that wasneither too hot nor too cold, but just right; and she liked it so wellthat she ate it all up; but the naughty old woman said a bad word aboutthe little porridge pot, because it did not hold enough for her.Then the little old woman sat down in the chair of the Great, HugeBear, and that was too hard for her.  And then she sat down in thechair of the Middle Bear, and that was too soft for her.  And then shesat down in the chair of the Little Small, Wee Bear, and that wasneither too hard nor too soft, but just right.  So she seated herselfin it, and there she sat till the bottom of the chair came out, anddown came she, plump upon the ground.  And the naughty old woman saidwicked words about that, too.Then the little old woman went upstairs into the bedchamber in whichthe three Bears slept.  And first she lay down upon the bed of theGreat, Huge Bear, but that was too high at the head for her.  And nextshe lay down upon the bed of the Middle Bear, and that was too high atthe foot for her.  And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little,Small, Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at thefoot, but just right.  So she covered herself up comfortably, and laythere till she fell asleep.  By this time the three Bears thought theirporridge would be cool enough, so they came home to breakfast.  Now thelittle old woman had left the spoon of the Great, Huge Bear standing inhis porridge."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!"said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great gruff voice.  And when theMiddle Bear looked at his, he saw that the spoon was standing in it,too.  They were wooden spoons; if they had been silver ones the naughtyold woman would have put them in her pocket."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!"said the middle Bear, in his middle voice.Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoonin the porridge pot, but the porridge was all gone."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!"said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.Upon this the three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their houseand eaten up the Little, Small, Wee Bear's breakfast, began to lookabout them.  Now the little old woman had not put the hard cushionstraight when she rose from the chair of the Great, Huge Bear."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.And the little old woman had squatted down the soft cushion of theMiddle Bear."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.And you know what the little old woman had done to the third chair."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SAT THE BOTTOM OUT OFIT!"said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.Then the three bears thought it necessary that they should make furthersearch; so they went upstairs into their bedchamber.  Now the littleold woman had pulled the pillow of the Great, Huge Bear out of itsplace."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.And the little old woman had pulled the bolster of the Middle Bear outof its place."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there wasthe bolster in its place, and upon the pillow was the little oldwoman's ugly, dirty head-which was not in its place, for she had nobusiness there."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED-AND HERE SHE IS!"said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.The little old woman had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruffvoice of the Great, Huge Bear, but she was so fast asleep that it wasno more to her than the moaning of wind or the rumbling of thunder.And she had heard the middle voice of the Middle Bear, but it was onlyas if she had heard some one speaking in a dream.  But when she heardthe little, small, wee voice of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, it was sosharp and so shrill that it awakened her at once.  Up she started, andwhen she saw the three bears on one side of the bed she tumbled herselfout at the other and ran to the window.  Now the window was open,because the Bears, like good, tidy bears as they were, always openedtheir bedchamber window when they got up in the morning.  Out thelittle old woman jumped, and whether she broke her neck in the fall orran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the woodand was taken up by the constable and sent to the House of Correctionfor a vagrant as she was, I cannot tell.  But the three Bears never sawanything more of her.PUSS IN BOOTSBy Charles PerraultA MILLER, dying, divided all his property between his three children.This was very easy, as he had nothing to leave but his mill, his ass,and his cat; so he made no will, and called in no lawyer.  The eldestson had the mill; the second, the ass; and the youngest, nothing butthe cat.  The young fellow was quite downcast at so poor a lot.  "Mybrothers," said he, "by putting their property together, may gain anhonest living, but there is nothing left for me except to die ofhunger, unless, indeed, I were to kill my cat and eat him, and make amuff of his skin."The cat, who heard all this, sat up on his four paws, and looking athim with a grave and wise air, said: "Master, I think you had betternot kill me; I shall be much more useful to you alive.""How so?" asked his master."You have but to give me a sack and a pair of boots, such as gentlemenwear when they go shooting, and you will find you are not so ill off asyou suppose."Now, though the young man did not much depend upon the cat's words,still he thought it rather surprising that a cat should speak at all.And he had before now seen him play a great many cunning tricks incatching rats and mice, so that it seemed advisable to trust him alittle further; especially as-poor young fellow-he had nobody else totrust.When the cat got his boots, he drew them on with a grand air, andslinging his sack over his shoulder, and drawing the cords of it roundhis neck, he marched bravely to a rabbit warren hard by, with which hewas well acquainted.  Then, putting some bran and lettuces into hisbag, and stretching himself out beside it as if he were dead, he waitedtill some fine, fat young rabbit, ignorant of the wickedness and deceitof the world, should peep into the sack to eat the food that wasinside.  This happened very shortly, for there are plenty of foolishyoung rabbits in every warren; and when one of them, who really was asplendid fat fellow, put his head inside, Master Puss drew the cordsimmediately, and took him and killed him without mercy.  Then, veryproud of his prey, he marched direct to the palace, and begged to speakwith the King.He was told to ascend to the apartment of his majesty, where, making alow bow, he said:  "Sire, here is a magnificent rabbit, killed in thewarren, which belongs to my lord the Marquis of Carabas, and which hetold me to offer humbly to your majesty.""Tell your master," replied the King, politely, "that I accept hispresent, and am very much obliged to him."Another time, Puss went out and hid himself and his sack in a wheatfield, and there caught two splendid fat partridges in the same manneras he had done the rabbit.  When he presented them to the King, with asimilar message as before, his majesty was so pleased that he orderedthe cat to be taken down into the kitchen and given something to eatand drink; where, while enjoying himself, the faithful animal did notcease to talk in the most cunning way of the large preserves andabundant game which belonged to his lord the Marquis of Carabas.One day, hearing that the King was intending to take a drive along theriverside with his daughter, the most beautiful princess in the world,Puss said to his master:  "Sir, if you would only follow my advice,your fortune is made.""Be it so," said the miller's son, who was growing disconsolate, andcared very little what he did:  "Say your say, cat.""It is but little," replied Puss, looking wise, as cats can.  "You haveonly to go and bathe in the river at a place which I shall show you,and leave all the rest to me.  Only remember that you are no longeryourself, but my lord the Marquis of Carabas.""Just so," said the miller's son, "it's all the same to me;" but he didas the cat told him.While he was bathing, the King and all the court passed by, and werestartled to hear loud cries of "Help! help!  my lord the Marquis ofCarabas is drowning."  The King put his head out of the carriage, andsaw nobody but the cat, who had at different times brought him so manypresents of game; however, he ordered his guards to fly quickly to thesuccor of my lord the Marquis of Carabas.  While they were pulling theunfortunate marquis out of the water, the cat came up, bowing, to theside of the King's carriage, and told a long and pitiful story aboutsome thieves who, while his master was bathing, had come and carriedaway all his clothes, so that it would be impossible for him to appearbefore his majesty and the illustrious princess."Oh, we will soon remedy that," answered the King, kindly andimmediately ordered one of the first officers of the household to rideback to the palace with all speed, and bring thence a supply of fineclothes for the young gentleman, who kept out of sight until theyarrived.  Then, being handsome and well-made, his new clothes becamehim so well, that he looked as if he had been a marquis all his days,and advanced with an air of respectful ease to offer his thanks to hismajesty.The King received him courteously, and the princess admired him verymuch.  Indeed, so charming did he appear to her, that she hinted to herfather to invite him into the carriage with them, which, you may besure the young man did not refuse.  The cat, delighted at the successof his scheme, went away as fast as he could, and ran so swiftly thathe kept a long way ahead of the royal carriage.  He went on and on,till he came to some peasants who were mowing in a meadow.  "Goodpeople," said he, in a very firm voice, "the King is coming past hereshortly, and if you do not say that the field you are mowing belongs tomy lord the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be chopped as small asmincemeat."So when the King drove by, and asked whose meadow it was where therewas such a splendid crop of hay, the mowers all answered, trembling,that it belonged to my lord the Marquis of Carabas."You have very fine land, marquis," said his majesty to the miller'sson, who bowed, and answered that "it was not a bad meadow, take italtogether."Then the cat came to a wheat field, where the reapers were reaping withall their might.  He bounced in upon them:  "The King is coming pastto-day, and if you do not tell him that this wheat belongs to my lordthe Marquis of Carabas, I will have you everyone chopped as small asmincemeat."  The reapers, very much alarmed, did as they were bid, andthe King congratulated the marquis upon possessing such beautifulfields, laden with such an abundant harvest.They drove on-the cat always running before and saying the same thingto everybody he met, that they were to declare that the whole countrybelonged to his master; so that even the King was astonished at thevast estate of my lord the Marquis of Carabas.But now the cat arrived at a great castle where dwelt an Ogre, to whombelonged all the land through which the royal carriage had beendriving.  This Ogre was a cruel tyrant, and his tenants and servantswere terribly afraid of him, which accounted for their being so readyto say whatever they were told to say by the cat, who had taken painsto inform himself all about the Ogre.  So, putting on the boldest facehe could assume, Puss marched up to the castle with his boots on, andasked to see the owner of it, saying that he was on his travels, butdid not wish to pass so near the castle of such a noble gentlemanwithout paying his respects to him.  When the Ogre heard this message,he went to the door, received the cat as civilly as an Ogre can, andbegged him to walk in and repose himself."Thank you, sir," said the cat; "but first I hope you will satisfy atraveler's curiosity.  I have heard in far countries of your manyremarkable qualities, and especially how you have the power to changeyourself into any sort of beast you choose-a lion, for instance, or anelephant.""That is quite true," replied the Ogre; "and lest you should doubt it Iwill immediately become a lion."He did so; and the cat was so frightened that he sprang up to the roofof the castle and hid himself in the gutter-a proceeding ratherinconvenient on account of his boots, which were not exactly fitted towalk with on tiles.  At length, perceiving that the Ogre had resumedhis original form, he came down again, and owned that he had been verymuch frightened."But, sir," said he, "it may be easy enough for such a big gentleman asyou to change himself into a large animal; I do not suppose you couldbecome a small one-a rat, or mouse, for instance.  I have heard thatyou can; still, for my part, I consider it quite impossible.""Impossible!" cried the other, indignantly.  "You shall see!" andimmediately the cat saw the Ogre no longer, but a little mouse runningalong on the floor.This was exactly what Puss wanted; and he fell upon him at once and atehim up.  So there was an end to the Ogre.By this time the King had arrived opposite the castle, and had a strongwish to go into it.  The cat, hearing the noise of the carriage wheels,ran forward in a great hurry, and, standing at the gate, said, in aloud voice:  "Welcome, sire, to the castle of my lord the Marquis ofCarabas.""What!" cried his majesty, very much surprised, "does the castle alsobelong to you?  Truly, marquis, you have kept your secret well up tothe last minute.  I have never seen anything finer than this courtyardand these battlements.  Let us go in, if you please."The marquis, without speaking, offered his hand to the princess to helpher to descend, and, standing aside that the King might enter first,followed his majesty to the great hall, where a magnificent dinner waslaid out, and where, without more delays they all sat down to feast.Before the banquet was over, the King, charmed with the good qualitiesof the Marquis of Carabas, said, bowing across the table at which theprincess and the miller's son were talking very confidentiallytogether:  "It rests with you, marquis, whether you will marry mydaughter.""I shall be only too happy," said the marquis, and the princess's cast-down eyes declared the same.So they were married the very next day, and took possession of theOgre's castle, and of everything that had belonged to him.As for the cat, he became at once a great lord, and had nevermore anyneed to run after mice, except for his own diversion.JACK THE GIANT-KILLERRetold by Joseph JacobsIN the reign of the famous King Arthur there lived in Cornwall a ladnamed Jack, who was a boy of a bold temper and took delight in hearingor reading of conjurers, giants, and fairies; and used to listeneagerly to the deeds of the knights of King Arthur's Round Table.In those days there lived on St. Michael's Mount, off Cornwall, a hugeGiant, eighteen feet high and nine feet round; his fierce and savagelooks were the terror of all who beheld him.He dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain, and used towade over to the mainland in search of prey, when he would throw half adozen oxen upon his back, and tie three times as many sheep and hogsround his waist, and march back to his own abode.The Giant had done this for many years when Jack resolved to destroyhim.Jack took a horn, a shovel, a pickaxe, his armor, and a dark lantern,and one winter's evening he went to the mount.  There he dug a pittwenty-two feet deep and twenty broad.  He covered the top over so asto make it look like solid ground.  He then blew such a blast on hishorn that the Giant awoke and came out of his den, crying out:  "Yousaucy villain, you shall pay for this!  I'll broil you for mybreakfast!"He had just finished, when, taking one step farther, he tumbledheadlong into the pit, and Jack struck him a blow on the head with hispickaxe which killed him.  Jack then returned home to cheer his friendswith the news.Another Giant, called Blunderbore, vowed to be revenged on Jack if everhe should have him in his power.This Giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely wood, andsome time after the death of Cormoran, Jack was passing through a wood,and, being weary, sat down and went to sleep.The Giant, passing by and seeing Jack, carried him to his castle, wherehe locked him up in a large room, the floor of which was covered withthe bodies, skulls, and bones of men and women.Soon after, the Giant went to fetch his brother, who was likewise aGiant, to take a meal off his flesh, and Jack saw with terror throughthe bars of his prison the two Giants approaching.Jack, perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord, took courage,and making a slip-knot at each end, he threw them over their heads, andtied it to the window-bars; he then pulled till he had choked them.When they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed themto the heart.Jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of Blunderbore andwent into the castle again.  He made a strict search through all therooms, and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair oftheir heads and almost starved to death.  They told him that theirhusbands had been killed by the Giants, who had then condemned them tobe starved to death."Ladies," said Jack, "I have put an end to the monster and his wickedbrother, and I give you this castle and all the riches it contains tomake some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt."  He then verypolitely gave them the keys of the castle and went farther on hisjourney to Wales.As Jack had but little money, he went on as fast as possible.  Atlength he came to a handsome house.Jack knocked at the door, when there came forth a Welsh Giant.  Jacksaid he was a traveler who had lost his way, on which the Giant madehim welcome and let him into a room where there was a good bed to sleepin.Jack took off his clothes quickly, but though he was weary he could notgo to sleep.  Soon after this he heard the Giant walking backward andforward in the next room and saying to himself:"Though here you shall lodge with me this night,You shall not see the morning light;My club shall dash your brains out quite!""Say you so?" thought Jack.  "Are these your tricks upon travelers?But I hope to prove as cunning as you are."  Then, getting out of bed,he groped about the room and at last found a thick tog of wood.  Helaid it in his own place in the bed, and then hid himself in a darkcorner of the room.The Giant, about midnight, entered the apartment, and with his bludgeonstruck many blows on the bed, in the very place where Jack had laid thelog; and then he went back to his own room, thinking he had broken allJack's bones.Early in the morning Jack put a bold face upon the matter and walkedinto the Giant's room to thank him for his lodging.  The Giant startedwhen he saw him, and began to stammer out:  "Oh! dear me; is it you?Pray, how did you sleep last night?  Did you hear or see anything inthe dead of the night?""Nothing worth speaking of," said Jack, carelessly; "a rat, I believe,gave me three or four slaps with its tail, and disturbed me a little;but I soon went to sleep again."The Giant wondered more and more at this; yet he did not answer a word,but went to bring two great bowls of hasty-pudding for their breakfast.Jack wanted to make the Giant believe that he could eat as much ashimself so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat andslip the hasty-pudding into this bag while he seemed to put it into hismouth.When breakfast was over he said to the Giant:  "Now I will show you afine trick.  I can cure all wounds with a touch; I could cut off myhead in one minute, and the next put it sound again on my shoulders.You shall see an example."  He then took hold of the knife, ripped upthe leathern bag, and all the hasty-pudding tumbled out upon the floor."Ods splutter hur nails!" cried the Welsh Giant, who was ashamed to beoutdone by such a little fellow as Jack, "hur can do that hurself;" sohe snatched up the knife, plunged it into his own stomach, and in amoment dropped down dead.Jack, having hitherto been successful in all his undertakings, resolvednot to be idle in future; he therefore furnished himself with a horse,a cap of knowledge, a sword of sharpness, shoes of swiftness, and aninvisible coat, the better to perform the wonderful enterprises thatlay before him.He traveled over high hills, and on the third day he came to a largeand spacious forest through which his road lay.  Scarcely had heentered the forest when he beheld a monstrous Giant dragging along bythe hair of their heads a handsome Knight and his lady.  Jack alightedfrom his horse, and tying him to an oak-tree, put on his invisiblecoat, under which he carried his sword of sharpness.When he came up to the Giant he made several strokes at him, but couldnot reach his body, but wounded his thighs in several places; and atlength, putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might,he cut off both his legs.  Then Jack, setting his foot upon his neck,plunged his sword into the Giant's body, when the monster gave a groanand expired.The Knight and his 1ady thanked Jack for their deliverance, and invitedhim to their house to receive a proper reward for his services.  "No,"Said Jack, "I cannot be easy till I find out this monster'shabitation."  So taking the Knight's directions, he mounted his horseand soon after came in sight of another Giant, who was sitting on ablock of timber waiting for his brother's return.Jack alighted from his horse, and, putting on his invisible coat,approached and aimed a blow at the Giant's head, but missing his aim heonly cut off his nose.  On this the Giant seized his club and laidabout him most unmercifully."Nay," said Jack, "if this be the case I'd better dispatch you!"  Sojumping upon the block, he stabbed him in the back, when he droppeddown dead.Jack then proceeded on his journey, and traveled over hills and dalestill, arriving at the foot of a high mountain, he knocked at the doorof a lonely house, when an old man let him in.When Jack was seated the hermit thus addressed him:  "My son, on thetop of this mountain is an enchanted castle, kept by the GiantGalligantus and a vile magician.  I lament the fate of a duke'sdaughter, whom they seized as she was walking in her father's garden,and brought hither transformed into a deer."Jack promised that in the morning, at the risk of his life, he wouldbreak the enchantment; and after a sound sleep he rose early, put onhis invisible coat, and got ready for the attempt.When he had climbed to the top of the mountain he saw two fierygriffins; but he passed between them without the least fear of danger,for they could not see him because of his invisible coat.  On thecastle gate he found a golden trumpet, under which were written theselines:Whoever can this trumpet blowShall cause the giant's overthrow.As soon as Jack had read this he seized the trumpet and blew a shrillblast, which made the gates fly open and the very castle itselftremble.The Giant and the conjurer now knew that their wicked course was at anend, and they stood biting their thumbs and shaking within fear.  Jack,with his sword of sharpness, soon killed the Giant, and the magicianwas then carried away by a whirlwind; and every knight and beautifullady who had been changed into birds and beasts returned to theirproper shapes.  The castle vanished away like smoke, and the head ofthe Giant Galligantus was sent to King Arthur.The knights and ladies rested that night at the old man's hermitage,and next day they set out for the Court.  Jack then went up to the Kingand gave his Majesty an account of all his fierce battles.Jack's fame had now spread through the whole country, and at the King'sdesire the Duke gave him his daughter in marriage, to the joy of allhis kingdom.  After this the King gave him a large estate, on which heand his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and contentment.TOM THUMBRetold by Joseph JacobsIN the days of the great Prince Arthur, there lived a mighty magician,named Merlin, the most learned and skillful enchanter the world hasever seen.This famous magician, who could take any form he pleased, wastravelling about as a poor  beggar, and being very tired he stopped atthe cottage of a Ploughman to rest himself, and asked for some food.The countryman bade him welcome, and his wife, who was a very good-hearted woman, brought him some milk in a wooden bowl and some coarsebrown bread on a platter.Merlin was much pleased with the kindness of the Ploughman and hiswife; but he could not help noticing that though everything was neatand comfortable in the cottage, they both seemed to be very unhappy.He therefore asked them why they were so melancholy, and learned thatthey were miserable because they had no children.The Poor Woman said, with tears in her eves:  "I should be the happiestcreature in the world if I had a son although he was no bigger than myhusband's thumb."Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a man'sthumb that he determined to grant the Poor Woman's wish.  Accordingly,in a short time after, the Ploughman's wife had a son, who, wonderfulto relate!  was not a bit bigger than his father's thumb.The Queen of the fairies, wishing to see the little fellow, came in atthe window, while the mother was sitting up in bed admiring him.  TheQueen kissed the child, and, giving it the name of Tom Thumb, sent forsome of the fairies, who dressed her little godson according to herorders:An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown;His shirt of web by spiders spun;With jacket wove of thistle's down;His trousers were of feathers done.His stockings, of apple rind, they tieWith eyelash from his mother's eye:His shoes were made of mouse's skin,Tann'd with the downy hair within.Tom never grew any larger than his father's thumb, but as he got olderhe became very cunning and full of tricks.  When he was old enough toplay with the boys, and had lost all his own cherry stones, he used tocreep into the bags of his play-fellows, fill his pockets, and, gettingout without their noticing him, would again join in the game.One day, as he was coming out of a bag of cherry stones, where he hadbeen stealing as usual, the boy to whom it belonged chanced to see him."Ah, ah! my little Tommy," said the boy, "so I have caught you stealingmy cherry stones at last, and you shall be rewarded for your thievishtricks."  On saying this, he drew the string tight round his neck, andgave the bag such a hearty shake that poor little Tom's legs, thighsand body were sadly bruised.  He roared out with pain and begged to belet out, promising never to steal again.A short time afterwards his mother was making a batter pudding, andTom, being anxious to see how it was made, climbed up to the edge ofthe bowl; but his foot slipped, and he plumped over head and ears intothe batter, without his mother noticing him, who stirred him into thepudding-bag, and put him in the pot to boil.The batter filled Tom's mouth, and prevented him from crying; but, uponfeeling the hot water, he kicked and struggled so much in the pot thathis mother thought that the pudding was bewitched, and, pulling it outof the pot, she threw it outside the door.  A poor tinker, who waspassing by, lifted up the pudding, put it in his bag, and walked off.As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of the batter, he began to cryaloud, which so frightened the tinker that he flung down the puddingand ran away.  The pudding being broke to pieces by the fall, Tom creptout covered all over with the batter, and walked home.  His mother, whowas very sorry to see her darling in such a woeful state, put him intoa teacup and soon washed off the batter; after which she kissed him andlaid him in bed.Soon after the adventure of the pudding, Tom's mother went to milk hercow in the meadow, and she took him along with her.  As the wind wasvery high, for fear of being blown away, she tied him to a thistle witha piece of fine thread.  The cow soon observed Tom's oak-leaf hat, andliking the appearance of it, took poor Tom and the thistle at onemouthful.  While the cow was chewing the thistle Tom was afraid of hergreat teeth, which threatened to crush him in pieces, and he roared outas loud as he could:  "Mother, mother!""Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?" said his mother."Here, mother," replied he, "in the red cow's mouth."His mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised atthe odd noise in her throat, opened her mouth and let Tom drop out.Fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to theground, or he would have been dreadfully hurt.  She then put Tom in herbosom and ran home with him.Tom's father made him a whip of barley straw to drive the cattle with,and having one day gone into the fields, Tom slipped a foot and rolledinto the furrow.  A raven, which was flying over, picked him up andflew with him over the sea, and there dropped him.A large fish swallowed Tom the moment he fell into the sea, which wassoon after caught and bought for the table of King Arthur.  When theyopened the fish in order to cook it, every one was astonished atfinding such a little boy, and Tom was quite delighted at being freeagain.  They carried him to the King, who made Tom his dwarf, and hesoon became a great favorite at court; for by his tricks and gambols henot only amused the King and Queen, but also the Knights of the RoundTable.It is said that when the King rode out on horseback he often took Tomalong with him, and if a shower came on he used to creep into hisMajesty's waistcoat pocket, where he slept till the rain was over.King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents, wishing to know ifthey were as small as he was, and whether they were well off.  Tom toldthe King that his father and mother were as tall as anybody about thecourt, but in rather poor circumstances.  On hearing this, the Kingcarried Tom to his treasury, the place where he kept all his money, andtold him to take as much money as he could carry home to his parents,which made the poor little fellow caper with joy.  Tom went immediatelyto procure a purse which was made of a water-bubble, and then returnedto the treasury, where he received a silver three-penny piece to putinto it.Our little hero had some difficulty in lifting the burden upon hisback; but he at last succeeded in getting it placed and set forward onhis journey.  Without meeting with any accident, and after restinghimself more than a hundred times by the way, in two days and twonights he reached his father's house in safety.Tom had traveled forty-eight hours with a huge silver piece on hisback, and was almost tired to death, when his mother ran out to meethim and carried him into the house.  But he soon returned to court.As Tom's clothes had suffered much in the batter pudding and the insideof the fish, his Majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes, and to bemounted as a knight on a mouse.Of Butterfly's wings his shirt was made,His boots of chicken's hide;And by a nimble fairy blade,Well learned in the tailoring trade,His clothing was supplied.A needle dangled by his side;A dapper mouse he used to ride,Thus strutted Tom in stately pride!It was certainly very amusing to see him in this dress and mounted onthe mouse, as he rode out a-hunting with the King and nobility, whowere all ready to expire with laughter at Tom and his fine prancingcharioteer.The King was so charmed with his address that he ordered a little chairto be made, in order that Tom might sit upon his table, and also apalace of gold, a span high, with a door an inch wide, to live in.  Healso gave him a coach, drawn by six small mice.The Queen was so enraged at the honors conferred on Sir Thomas that sheresolved to ruin him, and told the King that the little knight had beensaucy to her.The King sent for Tom in great haste, but being fully aware of thedanger of royal anger, he crept into an empty snail shell, where he layfor a long time until he was almost starved with hunger; at last heventured to peep out, and seeing a fine large butterfly on the ground,near the place of his concealment, he got close to it and jumpingastride on it was carried up into the, air.  The butterfly flew withhim from tree to tree and from field to field, at last returned to thecourt, where the King and nobility all strove to catch him; but at lastpoor Tom fell from his seat into a watering-pot, in which he was almostdrowned.When the Queen saw him she was in a rage, and said he should bebeheaded; and he was again put into a mouse trap until the time of hisexecution.However, a cat, observing something alive in the trap, patted it abouttill the wires broke, and set Thomas at liberty.The King received Tom again into favor, which he did not live to enjoy,for a large spider one day attacked him; and although he drew his swordand fought well, yet the spider's poisonous breath at last overcamehim.King Arthur and his whole court were so sorry at the loss of theirlittle favorite that they went into mourning and raised a fine whitemarble monument over his grave with the following epitaph:Here lies Tom Thumb, King Arthur's knight,Who died by a spider's cruel bite.He was well known in Arthur's court,Where he afforded gallant sport;He rode a tilt and tournament,And on a mouse a-hunting went.Alive he filled the court with mirth;His death to sorrow soon gave birth.Wipe, wipe your eyes, and shake your headAnd cry,-Alas!  Tom Thumb is dead!BLUE BEARDBy Charles PerraultTHERE was once a man who had fine houses, both in town and country, adeal of silver and gold plate, embroidered furniture, and coachesgilded all over with gold.  But this man was so unlucky as to have ablue beard, which made him so ugly that all the women and girls ranaway from him.One of his neighbors, a lady of quality, had two daughters who wereperfect beauties.  He asked her for one of them in marriage, butneither of them could bear the thought of marrying a man who had a bluebeard.  Besides, he had already been married several times, and nobodyever knew what became of his wives.In the hope of making them like him, Blue Beard took them, with theirmother and three or four ladies of their acquaintance, and other youngpeople of the neighborhood, to one of his country houses, where theystayed a whole week.There were parties of pleasure, hunting, fishing, dancing, mirth, andfeasting all the time.  Nobody went to bed, but all passed the time inmerry-making and joking with one another.  Everything succeeded so wellthat the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house was avery civil gentleman.  And his beard not so very blue after all.As soon as they returned home, the marriage took place.  About a monthafterward Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take ajourney for six weeks, about affairs of great consequence, desiring herto amuse herself in his absence, to send for her friends andacquaintances, to carry them in to the country if she pleased, and tohave a good time wherever she was."Here," said he, "are the keys of the two great wardrobes wherein Ihave my best furniture; these are of my silver and gold plate, which isnot every day in use; these open my strong boxes, which hold my money,both gold and silver; these my caskets of jewels; and this is themaster key to all my apartments.  This little one here is the key ofthe closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor.  Openthem all; go into all and every one of them, except that little closet,which I forbid you; if you happen to open it, there's nothing but whatyou may expect from my just anger and resentment."She promised to observe exactly whatever he ordered; so, havingembraced her, he got into his coach and proceeded on his journey.Her neighbors and good friends did not wait to be sent for, so greatwas their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house.  Theyran through all the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were all sofine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another.After that they went up into the two great rooms, where were the bestand richest furniture; they could not sufficiently admire the numberand beauty of the tapestries, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables,and looking-glasses, in which you might see yourself from head to foot;some of them were framed with glass, others with silver, plain andgilded, the finest and most magnificent ever seen.They ceased not to compliment and envy their friend, but she was somuch pressed by her curiosity to open the closet on the ground floorthat, without considering that it was very uncivil to leave hercompany, she went down a little back staircase with such haste that shehad twice or thrice like to have broken her neck.Arriving at the closet door, she hesitated, thinking of her husband'sorders and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she wasdisobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcomeit.  She took the little key and opened it, trembling, but could not atfirst see anything plainly because the windows were shut.  After somemoments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered withblood, in which lay the bodies of several dead women, ranged againstthe walls.  (These were the wives whom Blue Beard had married andmurdered, one after another.)  She thought she would die for fear, andthe key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand.After having somewhat recovered from the shock, she took up the key,locked the door, and went upstairs to her bedroom to rest.  Havingobserved that the key of the closet was stained with blood, she triedtwo or three times to wipe it off, but the stain would not come out; invain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand, the bloodstill remained, for the key was magical; when the blood was removedfrom one side it came again on the other.Blue Beard returned from his journey the same evening, and said he hadreceived letters upon the road informing him that the affair he wentabout was ended to his advantage.  His wife did all she could toconvince him she was extremely glad of his speedy return.Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but withsuch a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened."What!" said he, "is not the key of my closet among the rest?""I must certainly," said she, "have left it above upon the table.""Fail not," said Blue Beard, "to bring it to me presently."After several goings backward and forward she was forced to bring himthe key.  Blue Beard attentively considered it and said to his wife:"How comes this blood upon the key?""I do not know," cried the poor woman, paler than death."You do not know!" replied Blue Beard.  "I very well know.  You wereresolved to go into the closet, were you not?  Very well, madam; youshall go in and take your place among the ladies you saw there.Upon this she threw herself at her husband's feet, and begged hispardon with all the signs of a true repentance, vowing that she wouldnever again be disobedient.  She would have melted a rock, so beautifuland sorrowful was she; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any rock!"You must die, madam," said he, "and that; very soon.""Since I must die," answered she, her eyes bathed in tears, "give mesome little time to say my prayers.""I give you," replied Blue Beard, "half a quarter of an hour, but notone moment more."When she was alone she called out to her sister:"Sister Anne, go up, I beg you, on top of the tower and see if mybrothers are not coming; they promised me that they would come to-day,and if you see them, give them a sign to make haste."Sister Anne went up on the top of the tower, and the poor afflictedwife cried out from time to time:"Anne, sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?"And sister Anne replied:"I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, whichlooks green."In the meanwhile Blue Beard, holding a great saber in his hand, criedout as loud as he could bawl to his wife:"Come down instantly, or I shall come up after you.""One moment longer, if you please," said his wife; and then she criedout softly:  "Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see anybody coming?"And sister Anne answered:"I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which isgreen.""Come down quickly," shouted Blue Beard, "or I will come up after you.""I am coming," answered his wife; and then she cried:  "Anne, sisterAnne, dost thou not see any one coming?""I see," replied sister Anne, "a great dust, which comes on this side.""Are they my brothers?""Alas!  no, my dear sister, I see a flock of sheep.""Will you not come down?' roared Blue Beard."One moment longer," said his wife, and then she cried out:  "Anne,sister Anne, dost thou see nobody coming?""I see," said she, "two horsemen, but they are yet a great way off.""God be praised!" replied the poor wife joyfully; "they are mybrothers; I will make them a sign, as well as I can, for them to makehaste."Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole housetremble.  The distressed wife came down and threw herself at his feet,all in tears, with her hair about her shoulders."That will not help you," says Blue Beard; "you must die;" then, takinghold of her hair with one hand, and lifting up the sword with theother, he was going to cut off her head.  The poor lady, turning to himand looking at him with dying eyes, begged him to give her one littlemoment more."No, no," said he; "say your prayers," and was just about to strike...At this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate thatBlue Beard looked up in alarm.  The gate was opened and two horsemenentered, who drew their swords and ran directly at Blue Beard.  He knewthem to be his wife's brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer;so that he quickly ran to save himself; but the two brothers pursued soclose that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of theporch, and ran their swords through his body and left him dead.  Thepoor wife was almost as dead as her husband, and had not strengthenough to rise and welcome her brothers.Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all hisestate.  She made use of one part of it to marry her sister Anne to ayoung gentleman who had loved her a long while; another part to buycaptains' commissions for her brothers, and the rest to marry herselfto a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the unhappy time shehad passed with Blue Beard.THE BRAVE LITTLE TAILORAnonymousONE summer's day a little Tailor sat on his table by the window in thebest of spirits and sewed for dear life.  As he was sitting thus apeasant woman came down the street, calling out:  "Good jam to sell!good jam to sell!"  This sounded sweetly in the Tailor's ears; he puthis little head out of the window and shouted:  "Up here, my goodwoman, and you'll find a willing customer!"  The woman climbed up thethree flights of stairs with her heavy basket to the tailor's room, andhe made her spread out the pots in a row before him.  He examined themall, lifted them up and smelt them, and said at last:  "This jam seemsgood; weigh me four ounces of it, my good woman; and even if it's aquarter of a pound I won't stick at it."  The woman, who had hoped tofind a good market, gave him what he wanted, but went away grumblingwrathfully.  "Now Heaven shall bless this jam for my use," cried thelittle Tailor, "and it shall sustain and strengthen me."  He fetchedsome bread out of a cupboard, cut a round off the loaf, and spread thejam on it.  "That will taste good," he said; "but I'll finish thatwaistcoat first before I take a bite."  He placed the bread beside him,went on sewing, and out of the lightness of his heart kept on makinghis stitches bigger and bigger.  In the meantime the smell of the sweetjam rose to the ceiling, where swarms of flies were gathered, andattracted them to such an extent that they swarmed on to it in masses."Ha! who invited you?" said the Tailor, and chased the unwelcome guestsaway.  But the flies, who didn't understand English, refused to letthemselves be warned off, and returned again in even greater numbers.At last the Tailor, losing all patience, reached out of his chimney-corner for a duster, and exclaiming, "Wait, and I'll give it to you!"he beat them mercilessly with it.  When he left off he counted theslain, and no fewer than seven lay dead before him with outstretchedlegs.  "What a brave fellow I am!" said he, and was filled withadmiration at his own courage.  "The whole town must know about this;"and in great haste the little Tailor cut out a girdle, hemmed it, andembroidered on it in big letters, "Seven at a blow."  "What did I say,the town? no, the whole world shall hear of it," he said; and his heartbeat for joy as a lamb wags his tail.The Tailor strapped the girdle round his waist and set out into thewide world, for he considered his workroom too small a field for hisbravery.  Before he set forth he looked round about him, to see ifthere was anything in the house he could take with him on his journey;but he found nothing except an old cheese, which he took possession of.In front of the house he observed a bird that had been caught in somebushes, and this he put into his wallet beside the cheese.  Then hewent on his way merrily, and being light and quick he never felt tired.His way led up a hill on the top of which sat a powerful Giant, who wascalmly surveying the landscape.  The little Tailor went up to him, andgreeting him cheerfully said: "Good-day, friend; there you sit at yourease viewing the whole wide world.  I'm just on my way there.  What doyou say to accompanying me?"  The Giant looked contemptuously at theTailor, and said:  "What a poor, wretched little creature you are!""That's a good joke," answered the little Tailor, and unbuttoning hiscoat he showed the Giant the girdle.  "There, now, you can read whatsort of a fellow I am."  The Giant read:  "Seven at a blow," andthinking they were human beings the Tailor had slain, he had a certainrespect for the little man.  But first he thought he'd test him; sotaking up a stone in his hand, he squeezed it till some drops of waterran out.  "Now you do the same," said the Giant, "if you really wish tobe thought strong."  "Is that all?"  said the little Tailor; "that'schild's play to me."   So he dived into his wallet, brought out thecheese, and pressed it till the whey ran out.  "My squeeze was betterthan yours," said he.  The Giant didn't know what to say, for hecouldn't have believed it of the little fellow.  To prove him again,the Giant lifted a stone and threw it so high that the eye could hardlyfollow it.  "Now, my little dwarf, let me see you do that."  "Wellthrown," said the Tailor; "but, after all, your stone fell to theground; I'll throw one that won't come down at all."  He dived into hiswallet again, and grasping the bird in his hand he threw it up into theair.  The bird, enchanted to be free, soared up into the sky, and flewaway never to return.  "Well, what do you think of that little piece ofbusiness, friend?" asked the Tailor.  "You can certainly throw," saidthe Giant; "but now let's see if you can carry a proper weight."  Withthese words he led the Tailor to a huge oak-tree which had been felledto the ground, and said:  "If you are strong enough, help me carry thetree out of the wood."  "Most certainly," said the little Tailor: "justyou take the trunk on your shoulder; I'll bear the top and branches,which is certainly the heaviest part."  The Giant laid the trunk on hisshoulder, but the Tailor sat at his ease among the branches; and theGiant, who couldn't see what was going on behind him, had to carry thewhole tree, and the little Tailor into the bargain.  There he satbehind in the best of spirits, lustily whistling a tune, as if carryingthe tree were mere sport.  The Giant after dragging the heavy weightfor some time, could get on no farther, and shouted out:  "Hi!  I mustlet the tree fall."  The Tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the treewith both hands as if he had carried it the whole way, and said to theGiant:  "Fancy a big lazy fellow like you not being able to carry atree!"They continued to go on their way together, and as they passed by acherry-tree the Giant grasped the top of it, where the ripest fruithung, gave the branches into the Tailor's hand, and bade him eat.  Butthe little Tailor was far too weak to hold the tree down, and when theGiant let go the tree swung back into the air, bearing the littleTailor with it.  When he had fallen to the ground again without hurtinghimself, the Giant said:  "What!  do you mean to tell me you haven'tthe strength to hold down a feeble twig?"  "It wasn't strength that waswanting," replied time Tailor; "do you think that would have beenanything for a man who has killed seven at a blow?  I jumped over thetree because the huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us.  Doyou do the like if you dare."  The Giant made an attempt, but couldn'tget over the tree, and stuck fast in the branches, so that here, too,the little Tailor had the better of him."Well, you're a fine fellow, after all," said the Giant; "come andspend the night with us in our cave."  The little Tailor willinglyconsented to do this, and following his friend they went on till theyreached a cave where several other giants were sitting round a fire,each holding a roast sheep in his hand, of which he was eating.  Thelittle Tailor looked about him, and thought:  "Yes, there's certainlymore room to turn round in here than in my workshop."  The Giant showedhim a bed, and bade him lie down and have a good sleep.  But the bedwas too big for the little Tailor, so he didn't get into it, but creptaway into the corner.  At midnight, when the Giant thought the littleTailor was fast asleep, he rose up, and taking his big iron walking-stick, he broke the bed in two with a blow, and thought he had made anend of the little grasshopper.  At early dawn the Giants went off tothe wood, and quite forgot about the little Tailor, till all of asudden they met him trudging along in the most cheerful manner.  TheGiants were terrified at seeing him, and, fearing lest he should slaythem, they all took to their heels as fast as they could.The Little Tailor continued to follow his nose, and after he hadwandered about for a long time he came to the courtyard of a royalpalace, and feeling tired he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.While he lay there the people came, and looking him all over read onhis girdle, "Seven at a blow."  "Oh!" they said, "what can this greathero of a hundred fights want in our peaceful land?  He must indeed bea mighty man of valor."  They went and told the King about him, andsaid what a weighty and useful man he'd be in time of war and that itwould be well to secure him at any price.  This counsel pleased theKing, and he sent one of his courtiers down to the little Tailor, tooffer him, when he awoke, a commission in their army.  The messengerremained standing by the sleeper, and waited till he stretched hislimbs and opened his eyes, when he tendered his proposal.  "That's thevery thing I came here for," he answered; "I am quite ready to enterthe King's service."  So he was received with all honor, and given aspecial house of his own to live in.But the other officers were angry at the success of the little Tailor,and wished him a thousand miles away.  "What's to come of it all?" theyasked one another; "if we quarrel with him, he'll let out at us, and atevery blow seven will fall.  There'll soon be an end of us."  So theyresolved to go in a body to the King, and all to send in their papers."We are not made," they said.  "to hold out against a man who killsseven at a blow."  The King was grieved at the thought of losing allhis faithful servants for the sake of one man, and he wished heartilythat he had never set eyes on him, or that he could get rid of him.But he didn't dare to send him away, for he feared he might kill himand place himself on the throne.  He thought long and deeply over thematter, and finally came to a conclusion.  He sent for the Tailor andtold him that, seeing what a great and warlike hero he was, he wasabout to make him an offer.  In a certain wood of his kingdom theredwelt two Giants who did much harm by the way they robbed, murdered,burnt, and plundered everything about them; "no one could approach themwithout endangering his life.  If he could overcome and kill these twogiants he should have the King's only daughter for a wife, and half hiskingdom into the bargain; he might have a hundred horsemen, too, toback him up."  "That's the very thing for a man like me," thought thelittle Tailor; "one doesn't get the offer of a beautiful princess andhalf a kingdom every day."  "Done with you," he answered; "I'll soonput an end to the Giants.  But I haven't the smallest need of yourhundred horsemen; a fellow who can slay seven men at a blow need not beafraid of two."The little Tailor set out, and the hundred horsemen followed him.  Whenhe came to the outskirts of the wood he said to his followers:  "Youwait here, I'll manage the Giants by myself;" and he went on into thewood, casting his sharp little eyes right and left about him.  After awhile he spied the two Giants lying asleep under a tree, snoring tillthe very boughs bent with the breeze.  The little Tailor lost no timein filling his wallet with stones, and then climbed up the tree underwhich they lay.  When he got to about the middle of it he slipped alonga branch till he sat just above the sleepers, when he threw down onestone after the other on the nearest Giant.  The Giant felt nothing fora long time, but at last he woke up, and pinching his companion said:"What did you strike me for?"  "I didn't strike you," said the other;"you must be dreaming."  They both lay down to sleep again, and theTailor threw down a stone on the second Giant, who sprang up and cried:"What's that for?  Why did you throw something at me?"  "I didn't throwanything," growled the first one.  They wrangled on for a time, till asboth were tired, they made up the matter and fell asleep again.  Thelittle Tailor began his game once more, and flung the largest stone hecould find in his wallet with all his force, and hit the first Giant onthe chest.  "This is too much of a good thing!" he yelled, andspringing up like a madman, he knocked his companion against the treetill he trembled.  He gave, however, as good as he got, and they becameso enraged that they tore up trees and beat each other with them, tillthey both fell dead at once on the ground.  Then the little Tailorjumped down.  "It's a mercy," he said, "that they didn't root up thetree on which I was sitting, or I should have had to jump like asquirrel on to another, which, nimble though I am, would have been noeasy job."  He drew his sword and gave each of the Giants a very finethrust or two on the breast, and then went to the horsemen and said:"The deed is done; I've put an end to the two of them; but I assure youit has been no easy matter, for they even tore up trees in theirstruggle to defend themselves; but all that's of no use against one whoslays seven men at a blow."  "Weren't you wounded?" asked the horsemen."No fear," answered the Tailor; "they haven't touched a hair of myhead." But the horsemen wouldn't believe him till they rode into thewood and found the Giants weltering in their blood, and the trees lyingaround, torn up by the roots.The little Tailor now demanded the promised reward, but the Kingrepented his promise, and pondered once more how he could rid himselfof the hero.  "Before you obtain the hand of my daughter and half mykingdom," he said to him, "you must do another deed of valor.  Aunicorn is running about loose in the wood and doing much mischief; youmust first catch it."  "I'm even less afraid of one unicorn than of twoGiants; seven at a blow, that's my motto."  He took a piece of cord andan axe with him, went out to the wood, and again told the men who hadbeen sent with him to remain outside.  He hadn't to search long, forthe unicorn soon passed by, and, on perceiving the Tailor, dashedstraight at him as though it were going to spike him on the spot."Gently, gently," said he; "not so fast, my friend;" and standing stillhe waited till the beast was quite near, when he sprang lightly behinda tree; the unicorn ran with all its force against the tree, and rammedits horn so firmly into the trunk that it had no strength left to pullit out again, and was thus successfully captured.  "Now, I've caught mybird," said the Tailor, and he came out from behind the tree, placedthe cord round its neck first, then struck the horn out of the treewithin his axe, and when everything was in order led the beast Beforethe King.Still the King didn't want to give him the promised reward and made athird demand.  The Tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did agreat deal of harm in the wood; and he might have the huntsmen to helphim.  "Willingly," said the Tailor; "that's mere child's play."  But hedidn't take the huntsmen into the wood with him, and they were wellenough pleased to remain behind, for the wild boar had often receivedthem in a manner which did not make them desire its furtheracquaintance.  As soon as the boar perceived the Tailor it ran at himwith foaming mouth and gleaming teeth, and tried to knock him down; butour alert little friend ran into a chapel that stood near, and got outof the window with a jump.  The boar pursued him into the church, butthe Tailor skipped round to the door and closed it securely.  So theraging beast was caught, for it was far too heavy and unwieldy tospring out of the window.  The little Tailor summoned the huntsmentogether, that they might see the Prisoner with their own eyes.  Thenthe hero betook himself to the King, who was obliged now, whether heliked it or not, to keep his promise, and hand him over his daughterand half his kingdom.  Had he known that no hero-warrior, but only alittle tailor, stood before him, it would have gone even more to hisheart.  So the wedding was celebrated with much splendor and littlejoy, and the Tailor became a King.After a time the Queen heard her husband saying one night in his sleep:"My lad, make that waistcoat and patch these trousers, or I'll box yourears."  Thus she learned in what rank the young gentleman had beenborn, and next day she poured forth her woes to her father, and beggedhim to help her to get rid of a husband who was nothing more nor lessthan a tailor.  The King comforted her, and said:  "Leave your bedroomdoor open tonight; my servants shall stand outside, and when yourhusband is fast asleep they shall enter, bind him fast, and carry himon to a ship, which shall sail away out into the wide ocean."  TheQueen was well satisfied with the idea, but the armor-bearer, who hadoverheard everything, being much attached to his young master, wentstraight to him and revealed the whole plot.  "I'll soon put a stop tothe business," said the Tailor.  That night he and his wife went to bedat the usual time; and when she thought he had fallen asleep she gotup, opened the door, and then lay down again.  The little Tailor, whohad only pretended to be asleep, began to call out in a clear voice:"My lad, make that waistcoat and patch these trousers, or I'll box yourears.  I have killed seven at a blow, slain two giants, led a unicorncaptive, and caught a wild boar, then why should I be afraid of thosemen standing outside my door?"  The men, when they heard the Tailorsaying these words, were so terrified that they fled as if pursued by awild army, and didn't dare go near him again.  So the little Tailor wasand remained a King all the days of his life.THE SLEEPING BEAUTY IN THE WOODBy Charles PerraultTHERE was once in a distant country a King and Queen whose only sorrowwas that they had no children.  At last the Queen gave birth to alittle daughter and the King showed his joy by giving a christeningfeast so grand that the like of it was never known.  He asked all thefairies in the land-there were seven found in the kingdom-to standgodmothers to the little Princess; hoping that each might bestow on hersome good gift.After the christening all the guests returned to the palace, wherethere was placed before each fairy godmother a magnificent covereddish, and a knife, fork, and spoon of pure gold, set with preciousstones.  But, as they all were sitting down at table there entered anold fairy who had not been invited, because it was more than fiftyyears since she had gone out of a certain tower, and she was thought tobe dead or enchanted.  The King ordered a cover to be placed for her,but it was of common earthenware, for he had ordered from his jeweleronly seven gold dishes, for the seven fairies aforesaid.  The old fairythought herself neglected, and muttered angry threats, which wereoverheard by one of the younger fairies, who chanced to sit beside her.This good godmother, afraid of harm to the pretty baby, hastened tohide herself behind the hangings in the hall.  She did this because shewished to speak last and repair any evil the old fairy might intend.The fairies now offered their good wishes, which, unlike most wishes,were sure to come true.  The first wished that the little Princessshould grow up the fairest woman in the world; the second, that sheshould have wit like an angel; the third, that she should be perfectlygraceful; the fourth, that she should sing like a nightingale; thefifth, that she should dance perfectly well; the sixth, that she shouldplay all kinds of music perfectly.  Then the old fairy's turn came.Shaking her head spitefully, she uttered the wish that when the babygrew up into a young lady, and learned to spin, she might prick herfinger with a spindle and die of the wound.This terrible prophecy made all the company tremble; and every one fellto crying.  Upon which the wise young fairy appeared from behind thecurtains and said: "Assure yourselves O King and Queen; the Princessshall not die.  I have no power to undo what my elder has done.  ThePrincess must pierce her finger with a spindle and she shall then sink,not into the sleep of death, but into a sleep that will last a hundredyears.  After that time is ended, the son of a King shall come andawake her."Then all the fairies vanished.The King, in the hope of avoiding his daughter's doom, issued an edictforbidding all persons to spin, and even to have spinning wheels intheir houses, on pain of instant death.  But it was in vain.  One daywhen she was just fifteen years of age, the King and Queen left theirdaughter alone in one of their castles, where, wandering about at herwill, she came to a little room in the top of a tower, and there founda very old woman, who had not heard of the King's edict, busy with herspinning wheel."What are you doing, good old woman?" said the Princess."I'm spinning my pretty child.""Ah, how pretty!  Let me try if I can spin also."She had no sooner taken up the spindle than, being hasty and unhandy,she pierced her finger with the point.  Though it was so small a wound,she fainted away at once and dropped on the floor.  The poor old womancalled for help; shortly came the ladies-in-waiting, who tried everymeans to restore their young mistress; but all in vain.  She lay,beautiful as an angel, the color still lingering in her lips andcheeks, her fair bosom softly stirred with her breath; only her eyeswere fast closed.  When the King, her father, and the Queen, hermother, beheld her thus, they knew that all had happened as the cruelfairy meant, and that their daughter would sleep for one hundred years.They sent away all the physicians and attendants, and themselvessorrowing laid her upon a bed in the finest apartment in the palace.There she slept and looked like a sleeping angel still.When this misfortune happened, the kindly young fairy who had saved thePrincess by changing her sleep of death into this sleep of a hundredyears, was twelve thousand leagues away, in the kingdom of Mataquin.But, being informed of everything by a little dwarf who wore seven-league boots, she arrived speedily in a chariot of fire drawn bydragons.  The King handed her out of the chariot, and she approved ofall he had done.  Then, being a fairy of great common sense andforesight, she thought that the Princess, awakening after a hundredyears in this old castle, might not know what to do with herself if shefound herself alone.  Accordingly, she touched with her magic wandeverybody and everything in the palace except the King and Queen:governesses, ladies of honor, waiting maids, gentlemen ushers, cooks,kitchen girls, pages, footmen; even the horses that were in thestables, and the grooms that attended them, she touched each and all.Nay, the dogs, too, in the outer court, and the little fat lapdog,Mopsey, who had laid himself down beside his mistress on her splendidbed, were also touched, and they, like all the rest, fell fast asleepin a moment.  The very spits that were before the kitchen fire fellasleep, and the fire itself, and everything became as still as if itwere the middle of the night, or as if the palace were a palace of thedead.The King and Queen, having kissed their daughter, went out of thecastle, giving orders that it was to be approached no more.  Thecommand was unnecessary, for in one quarter of an hour there sprang uparound it a wood so thick and thorny that neither beasts nor men couldattempt to penetrate there.  Above this dense mass of forest could onlybe seen the top of the high tower where the lovely Princess slept.When a hundred years were gone the King had died, and his throne hadpassed to another royal family.  The reigning King's son, being one dayout hunting, was stopped in the chase by this great wood, inquired whatwood it was and what were those towers which he saw appearing out ofthe midst of it.  Every one answered as he had heard.  Some said it wasan old castle haunted by spirits.  Others said it was the abode ofwitches and enchanters.  The most common story was that an Ogre livedthere, a giant with long teeth and claws, who carried away naughtylittle boys and girls and ate them up.  The Prince did not know what tothink.  At length an old peasant was found who remembered having heardhis grandfather say to his father that in this tower was a Princess,beautiful as the day, who was doomed to sleep there for one hundredyears, until awakened by a king's son, who was to marry her.At this the young Prince, who had the spirit of a hero, determined tofind out the truth for himself.Spurred on by love and honor, he leaped from his horse and began toforce his way through the thick wood.  To his amazement the stiffbranches all gave way, and the ugly thorns drew back of their ownaccord, and the brambles buried themselves in the earth to let himpass.  This done, they closed behind him, allowing none to follow.Nevertheless, he pushed boldly on alone.The first thing he saw was enough to freeze him with fear.  Bodies ofmen and horses lay extended on the ground; but the men had faces, notdeath white, but red as roses, and beside them were glasses half filledwith wine, showing that they had gone to sleep drinking.  Next heentered a large court paved with marble, where stood rows of guardspresenting arms, but as still as if cut out of stone; then he passedthrough many chambers where gentlemen and ladies, all in the dress ofthe past century, slept at their ease, some standing, some sitting.The pages were lurking in corners, the ladies of honor were stoopingover their embroidery frames or listening to the gentlemen of thecourt; but all were as silent and as quiet as statues.  Their clothes,strange to say, were fresh and new as ever; and not a particle of dustor spider web had gathered over the furniture, though it had not knowna broom for a hundred years.  Finally, the astonished Prince came to aninner chamber, where was the fairest sight his eyes ever beheld.A young girl of wonderful beauty lay asleep on an embroidered bed, andshe looked as if she had only just closed her eyes.  Trembling, thePrince approached and knelt beside her.  Some say he kissed her; but asnobody saw it, and she never told, we cannot be quite sure of the fact.However, as the end of the enchantment had come, the Princess waked atonce, and, looking at him with eyes of the tenderest regard, said,sleepily: "Is it you, my Prince?  I have waited for you very long."Charmed with these words, and still more by the tone in which they wereuttered, the Prince assured her that he loved her more than his life.For a long time did they sit talking, and yet had not said half enough.Their only interruption was the little dog Mopsey, who had awakenedwith his mistress, and now began to be jealous that the Princess didnot notice him as much as she was wont to do.Meanwhile all the attendants, whose enchantment was also broken, notbeing in love, were ready to die of hunger after their fast of ahundred years.  A lady of honor ventured to say that dinner was served,whereupon the Prince handed his beloved Princess at once to the greathall.  She did not wait to dress for dinner, being already perfectlyand magnificently attired, though in a fashion somewhat out of date.However, her lover had the politeness not to notice this, nor to remindher that she was dressed exactly like his grandmother whose portraitstill hung on the palace walls.During dinner a concert by the attendant musicians took place, and,considering they had not touched their instruments for a century, theyplayed the old tunes extremely well.  They ended with a wedding march,for that very evening the Prince and Princess were married.After a few days they went together out of the castle and enchantedwood, both of which immediately vanished, and were nevermore beheld bymortal eyes.  The Princess was restored to her ancestral kingdom, andafter a few years the Prince and she became King and Queen, and ruledlong and happily.THE FAIR ONE WITH GOLDEN LOCKSRetold by Miss MulockTHERE was once a King's daughter so beautiful that they named her theFair One with Golden Locks.  These golden locks were the mostremarkable in the world, soft and fine, and falling in long waves downto her very feet.  She wore them always thus, loose and flowing,surmounted with a wreath of flowers; and though such long hair wassometimes rather inconvenient, it was so exceedingly beautiful, shiningin the sun like ripples of molten gold, that everybody agreed she fullydeserved her name.Now there was a young King of a neighboring country, very handsome,very rich, and wanting nothing but a wife to make him happy.  He heardso much of the various perfections of the Fair One with Golden Locks,that at last, without even seeing her, he fell in love with her sodesperately that he could neither eat nor drink, and resolved to sendan ambassador at once to demand her in marriage.  So he ordered amagnificent equipage-more than a hundred horses and a hundred footmen-in order to bring back to him the Fair One with Golden Locks, who, henever doubted, would be only too happy to become his Queen.  Indeed, hefelt so sure of her that he refurnished the whole palace, and had madeby all the dressmakers of the city, dresses enough to last a lady alifetime.  But, alas! when the ambassador arrived and delivered hismessage, either the princess was in bad humor, or the offer did notappear to be to her taste; for she returned her best thanks to hismajesty, but said she had not the slightest wish or intention to getmarried.  She also, being a prudent damsel, declined receiving any ofthe presents which the King had sent her; except that, not quite tooffend his majesty, she retained a box of English pins, which were inthat country of considerable value.When the ambassador returned, alone and unsuccessful, all the court wasvery much affected, and the King himself began to weep with all hismight.  Now, there was in the palace household a young gentleman namedAvenant, beautiful as the sun, besides being at once so amiable and sowise that the King confided to him all his affairs; and every one lovedhim, except those people-to be found in all courts-who were envious ofhis good fortune.  These malicious folk hearing him say gaily: "If theKing had sent me to fetch the Fair One with Golden Locks, I know shewould have come back with me," repeated the saying in such a manner,that it appeared as if Avenant thought so much of himself and hisbeauty, and felt sure the princess would have followed him all over theworld; which when it came to the ears of the King, as it was meant todo, irritated him so much that he commanded Avenant to be imprisoned ina high tower and left to die there of hunger.  The guards accordinglycarried off the young man, who had quite forgotten his idle speech, andhad not the least idea what fault he had committed.  They ill-treatedhim very much, and then left him with nothing to eat and only water todrink.  This, however, kept him alive for a few days, during which hedid not cease to complain aloud, and to call upon the King, saying: "OhKing, what harm have I done?  You have no subject more faithful than I.Never have I had a thought which could offend you."And it so befell that the King, coming by chance, or else with a sortof remorse, past the tower, was touched by the voice of the youngAvenant, whom he had once so much regarded.  In spite of all thecourtiers could do to prevent him, he stopped to listen, and overheardthese words.  The tears rushed into his eyes; he opened the door of thetower, and called: "Avenant!"  Avenant came, creeping feebly along,fell at the King's knees, and kissed his feet:"Oh sire, what have I done that you should treat me so cruelly?""You have mocked me and my ambassador; for you said, if I had sent youto fetch the Fair One with Golden Locks, you would have been successfuland brought her back.""I did say it, and it was true," replied Avenant fearlessly; "for Ishould have told her so much about your majesty and your various highqualities, which no one knows so well as myself, that I am persuadedshe would have returned with me.""I believe it," said the King, with an angry look at those who hadspoken ill of his favorite; he then gave Avenant a free pardon and tookhim back with him to the court.After having supplied the famished youth with as much supper as hecould eat, the King admitted him to a private audience, and said: "I amas much in love as ever with the Fair One with Golden Locks, so I willtake thee at thy word, and send thee to try and win her for me.""Very well, please your majesty" replied Avenant cheerfully; "I willdepart to-morrow."The King, overjoyed with his willingness and hopefulness would havefurnished him with a still more magnificent equipage and suite than thefirst ambassador but Avenant refused to take anything except a goodhorse to ride, and letters of introduction to the Princess's father.The King embraced him and eagerly saw him depart.It was on a Monday morning when, without any pomp or show, Avenant thusstarted on his mission.  He rode slowly and meditatively, ponderingover every possible means of persuading the Fair One with Golden Locksto marry the King; but, even after several days journey towards hercountry, no clear project had entered into his mind.  One morning, whenhe had started at break of day, he came to a great meadow with a streamrunning through it, along which were planted willows and poplars.  Itwas such a pleasant, rippling stream that he dismounted and sat down onits banks.  There he perceived gasping on the grass a large goldenCarp, which, in leaping too far after gnats, had thrown itself quiteout of the water, and now lay dying on the greensward.  Avenant tookpity on it, and though he was very hungry, and the fish was very fat,and he would well enough have liked it for his breakfast, still helifted it gently and put it back into the stream.  No sooner had theCarp touched the fresh cool water than it revived and swam away; butshortly returning, it spoke to him from the water in this wise:"Avenant, I thank you for your good deed.  I was dying, and you havesaved me; I will recompense you for this one day."After this pretty little speech, the fish popped down to the bottom ofthe stream, according to the habit of Carp, leaving Avenant very muchastonished, as was natural.Another day he met with a Raven that was in great distress, beingpursued by an Eagle, which would have swallowed him up in no time."See," thought Avenant, "how the stronger oppress the weaker!  Whatright has an Eagle to eat up a Raven?"  So taking his bow and arrow,which he always carried, he shot the Eagle dead, and the Raven,delighted, perched in safety on an opposite tree."Avenant," screeched he, though not in the sweetest voice in the world,"you have generously succored me, a poor miserable Raven.  I am notungrateful, and I will recompense you one day.""Thank you," said Avenant, and continued his road.Entering in a thick wood, so dark with the shadows of early morningthat he could scarcely find his way, he heard an Owl hooting, like anowl in great tribulation.  She had been caught by the nets spread bybird-catchers to entrap finches, larks, and other small birds.  "What apity," thought Avenant, "that men must always torment poor birds andbeasts who have done them no harm!"  So he took out his knife, cut thenet, and let the Owl go free.  She went sailing up in the air, butimmediately returned hovering over his head on her brown wings."Avenant," said she, "at daylight the bird-catchers would have beenhere, and I should have been caught and killed.  I have a gratefulheart; I will recompense you one day."These were the three principal adventures that befell Avenant on hisway to the kingdom of the Fair One with Golden Locks.  Arrived there,he dressed himself with the greatest care, in a habit of silverbrocade, and a hat adorned with plumes of scarlet and white.  He threwover all a rich mantle, and carried a little basket, in which was alovely little dog, an offering of respect to the Princess.  With thishe presented himself at the palace gates, where even though he camealone, his mien was so dignified and graceful, so altogether charming,that every one did him reverence, and was eager to run and tell theFair One with Golden Locks, that Avenant, another ambassador from theKing, her suitor, awaited an audience."Avenant!" repeated the Princess.  "That is a pretty name; perhaps theyouth is pretty too.""So beautiful," said the ladies of honor, "that while he stood underthe palace window we could do nothing but look at him.""How silly of you!" sharply said the Princess.  But she desired them tobring her robe of blue satin, to comb out her long hair, and adorn itwith the freshest garland of flowers; to give her her high-heeledshoes, and her fan.  "Also," added she, "take care that my audience-chamber is well swept and my throne well dusted.  I wish in everythingto appear as becomes the Fair One with Golden Locks."This done she seated herself on her throne of ivory and ebony and gaveorders for her musicians to play, but softly, so as not to disturbconversation.  Thus, shining in all her beauty, she admitted Avenant toher presence.He was so dazzled that at first he could not speak; then he began anddelivered his harangue to perfection."Gentle Avenant," returned the Princess, after listening to all hisreasons for her returning with him, "your arguments are very strong,and I am inclined to listen to them; but you must first find for me aring, which I dropped into the river about a month ago.  Until Irecover it, I can listen to no proposition of marriage."Avenant, surprised and disturbed, made her a profound reverence andretired, taking with him the basket and the little dog Cabriole, whichshe refused to accept.  All night long he sat sighing to himself.  "Howcan I ever find a ring which she dropped into the river a month ago?She has set me an impossibility.""My dear master," said Cabriole, "nothing is an impossibility to one soyoung and charming as you are; let us go at daybreak to the river-side."Avenant patted him, but replied nothing; until, worn out with grief, heslept.  Before dawn Cabriole wakened him, saying: "Master, dressyourself and let us go to the river."There Avenant walked up and down, with his arms folded and his headbent, but saw nothing.  At last he heard a voice, calling from adistance, "Avenant, Avenant!"The little dog ran to the water-side.- "Never believe me again, master,if it is not a golden Carp with a ring in its mouth!""Yes, Avenant," said the Carp, "this is the ring which the Princess haslost.  You saved my life in the willow meadow, and I have recompensedyou.  Farewell!"Avenant took the ring gratefully and returned to the palace withCabriole, who scampered about in great glee.Craving an audience, he presented the Princess with her ring, andbegged her to accompany him to his master's kingdom.  She took thering, looked at it, and thought she was surely dreaming."Some fairy must have assisted you, fortunate Avenant," said she."Madam, I am only fortunate in my desire to obey your wishes.""Obey me still," she said graciously.  "There is a prince namedGalifron, whose suit I have refused.  He is a giant as tall as a tower,who eats a man as a monkey eats a nut: he puts cannons into his pocketsinstead of pistols; and when he speaks, his voice is so loud that everyone near him becomes deaf.  Go and fight him, and bring me his head."Avenant was thunderstruck; but after a time he recovered himself."Very well, madam, I shall certainly perish, but I will perish like abrave man.  I will depart at once to fight the Giant Galifron."The Princess, now in her turn surprised and alarmed, tried everypersuasion to induce him not to go, but in vain.  Avenant armed himselfand started, carrying his little dog in its basket.  Cabriole was theonly creature that gave him consolation: "Courage, master!  While youattack the giant, I will bite his legs: he will stoop down to strikeme, and then you can knock him on the head."  Avenant smiled at thelittle dog's spirit, but he knew it was useless.Arrived at the castle of Galifron, he found the road all strewn withbones, and carcasses of men.  Soon he saw the giant walking.  His headwas level with the highest trees, and he sang in a terrific voice:"Bring me babies to devour;More-more-more-more-Men and women, tender and tough;All the world holds not enough."To which Avenant replied, imitating the tune:"Avenant you here may see,He is come to punish thee:Be he tender, be he tough,To kill thee, giant, he is enough."Hearing these words, the giant took up his massive club, looked aroundfor the singer, and perceiving him, would have slain him on the spot,had not a Raven, sitting on a tree close by, suddenly flown out uponhim and picked out both his eyes.  Then Avenant easily killed him andcut off his head, while the Raven, watching him, said:"You shot the Eagle who was pursuing me: I promised to recompense you,and to-day I have done it.  We are quits.""No, it is I who am your debtor, Sir Raven," replied Avenant, as,hanging the frightful head to his saddle-bow, he mounted his horse androde back to the city of the Fair One with Golden Locks.There everybody followed him, shouting: "Here is brave Avenant, who haskilled the giant," until the Princess, hearing the noise, and fearingit was Avenant himself who was killed, appeared, all trembling; andeven when he appeared with Galifron's head, she trembled still,although she had nothing to fear."Madam," said Avenant, "your enemy is dead; so I trust you will acceptthe hand of the King my master.""I cannot," replied she thoughtfully, "unless you first bring me aphial of the water in the Grotto of Darkness.  It is six leagues inlength, and guarded at the entrance by two fiery dragons.  Within, itis a pit, full of scorpions, lizards, and serpents, and at the bottomof this place flows the Fountain of Beauty and Health.  All who wash init become, if ugly, beautiful, and if beautiful, beautiful forever; ifold, young; and if young, young forever.  Judge then, Avenant, if I canquit my kingdom without carrying with me some of this miraculouswater.""Madam," replied Avenant, "you are already so beautiful that yourequire it not; but I am an unfortunate ambassador whose death youdesire; I will obey you, though I know I shall never return."So he departed with his only friends-his horse and his faithful dogCabriole; while all who met him looked at him compassionately, pityingso pretty a youth bound on such a hopeless errand.  But, however kindlythey addressed him, Avenant rode on and answered nothing, for he wastoo sad at heart.He reached a mountain-side, where he sat down to rest, leaving hishorse to graze, and Cabriole to run after the flies.  He knew that theGrotto of Darkness was not far off, yet he looked about him like onewho sees nothing.  At last he perceived a rock, as black as ink, whencecame a thick smoke; and in a moment appeared one of the two dragons,breathing out flames.  It had a yellow and green body, claws, and along tail.  When Cabriole saw the monster, the poor little dog hidhimself in terrible fright.  But Avenant resolved to die bravely; sotaking a phial which the Princess had given him, he prepared to descendinto the cave."Cabriole," said he, "I shall soon be dead; then fill this phial withmy blood, and carry it to the Fair One with Golden Locks, and afterwardto the King, my master, to show him I have been faithful to the last."While he was thus speaking a voice called: "Avenant, Avenant!"-and hesaw an Owl sitting on a hollow tree.  Said the Owl: "You cut the net inwhich I was caught, and I vow to recompense you.  Now is the time.Give me the phial; I know every corner of the Grotto of Darkness-I willfetch you the water of beauty."Delighted beyond words, Avenant delivered up his phial; the Owl flewwith it into the grotto, and in less than half an hour reappeared,bringing it quite full and well corked.  Avenant thanked her with allhis heart, and joyfully took once more the road to the city.The Fair One with Golden Locks had no more to say.  She consented toaccompany him back, with all her suite, to his master's court.  On theway thither she saw so much of him, and found him so charming, thatAvenant might have married her himself had he chosen; but he would nothave been false to his master for all the beauties under the sun.  Atlength they arrived at the King's city, and the Fair One with GoldenLocks became his spouse and Queen.  But she still loved Avenant in herheart, and often said to the King her lord: "But for Avenant I shouldnot be here; he has done all sorts of impossible deeds for my sake; hehas fetched me the water of beauty, and I shall never grow old-inshort, I owe him everything."And she praised him in this sort so much that at length the King becamejealous; and though Ayenant gave him not the slightest cause ofoffense, he shut him up in the same high tower once more-but with ironson his hands and feet, and a cruel jailer besides, who fed him withbread and water only.  His sole companion was his little dog Cabriole.When the Fair One with Golden Locks heard of this, she reproached herhusband for his ingratitude, and then throwing herself at his knees,implored that Avenant might be set free.  But the King only said: "Sheloves him!" and refused her prayer.  The Queen entreated no more, butfell into a deep melancholy.When the King saw it, he thought she did not care for him because hewas not handsome enough; and that if he could wash his face with herwater of beauty, it would make her love him the more.  He knew that shekept it in a cabinet in her chamber, where she could find it always.Now it happened that a waiting-maid, in cleaning out this cabinet, had,the very day before, knocked down the phial, which was broken in athousand pieces, and all the contents were lost.  Very much alarmed,she then remembered seeing, in a cabinet belonging to the King, asimilar phial.  This she fetched, and put in the place of the otherone, in which was the water of beauty.  But the King's phial containedthe water of death.  It was a poison, used to destroy great criminals-that is, noblemen, gentlemen, and such like.  Instead of hanging themor cutting their heads off, like common people, they were compelled towash their faces with this water; upon which they fell asleep, and wokeno more.  So it happened that the King, taking up this phial, believingit to be the water of beauty, washed his face with it, fell asleep,and-died.Cabriole heard the news, and, gliding in and out among the crowd whichclustered round the young and lovely widow, whispered softly to her-"Madam, do not forget poor Avenant."  If she had been disposed to doso, the sight of his little dog would have been enough to remind her ofhim-his many sufferings, and his great fidelity.  She rose up, withoutspeaking to anybody, and went straight to the tower where Avenant wasconfined.  There, with her own hands, she struck off his chains, andputting a crown of gold on his head, and a purple mantle on hisshoulders, said to him, "Be King- and my husband.Avenant could not refuse: for in his heart he had loved her all thetime.  He threw himself at her feet, and then took the crown andscepter, and ruled her kingdom like a king.  All the people weredelighted to have him as their sovereign.  The marriage was celebratedin all imaginable pomp, and Avenant and the Fair One with Golden Lockslived and reigned happily together all their days.BEAUTY AND THE BEASTBy Mme. d'AulnoyTHERE was once a very rich merchant, who had six children, three boysand three girls.  As he was himself a man of great sense, he spared noexpense for their education.  The three daughters were all handsome,but particularly the youngest; indeed, she was so very beautiful, thatin her childhood everyone called her the Little Beauty; and beingequally lovely when she was grown up, nobody called her by any othername, which made her sisters very jealous of her.  This youngestdaughter was not only more handsome than her sisters, but also wasbetter tempered.  The two eldest were vain of their wealth andposition.  They gave themselves a thousand airs, and refused to visitother merchants' daughters; nor would they condescend to be seen exceptwith persons of quality.They went every day to balls, p1ays, and public walks, and always madegame of their youngest sister for spending her time in reading or otheruseful employments.  As it was well known that these young ladies wouldhave large fortunes, many great merchants wished to get them for wives;but the two eldest always answered, that, for their parts, they had nothoughts of marrying anyone below a duke or an earl at least.  Beautyhad quite as many offers as her sisters, but she always answered, withthe greatest civility, that though she was much obliged to her lovers,she would rather live some years longer with her father, as she thoughtherself too young to marry.It happened that, by some unlucky accident, the merchant suddenly lostall his fortune, and had nothing left but a small cottage in thecountry.  Upon this he said to his daughters, while the tears ran downhis cheeks, "My children, we must now go and dwell in the cottage, andtry to get a living by labor, for we have no other means of support."The two eldest replied that they did not know how to work, and wouldnot leave town; for they had lovers enough who would be glad to marrythem, though they had no longer any fortune.  But in this they weremistaken; for when the lovers heard what had happened, they said, "Thegirls were so proud and ill-tempered, that all we wanted was theirfortune; we are not sorry at all to see their pride brought down; letthem show off their airs to their cows and sheep."  But everybodypitied poor Beauty, because she was so sweet-tempered and kind to all,and several gentlemen offered to marry her, though she had not a penny;but Beauty still refused, and said she could not think of leaving herpoor father in this trouble.  At first Beauty could not help sometimescrying in secret for the hardships she was now obliged to suffer; butin a very short time she said to herself, "All the crying in the worldwill do me no good, so I will try to be happy without a fortune."When they had removed to their cottage, the merchant and his three sonsemployed themselves in ploughing and sowing the fields, and working inthe garden.  Beauty also did her part, for she rose by four o'clockevery morning, lighted the fires, cleaned the house, and got ready thebreakfast for the whole family.  At first she found all this very hard;but she soon grew quite used to it, and thought it no hardship; indeed,the work greatly benefited her health.  When she had done, she used toamuse herself with reading, playing her music, or singing while shespun.  But her two sisters were at a loss what to do to pass the timeaway; they had their breakfast in bed, and did not rise till teno'clock.  Then they commonly walked out, but always found themselvesvery soon tired; when they would often sit down under a shady tree, andgrieve for the loss of their carriage and fine clothes, and say to eachother, "What a mean-spirited, poor stupid creature our young sister is,to be so content within this low way of life!"  But their fatherthought differently; and loved and admired his youngest child more thanever.After they had lived in this manner about a year the merchant receiveda letter, which informed him that one of his richest ships, which hethought was lost, had just come unto port.  This news made the twoeldest sisters almost mad with joy; for they thought they should nowleave the cottage, and have all their finery again.  When they foundthat their father must take a journey to the ship, the two eldestbegged he would not fail to bring them back some new gowns, caps,rings, and all sorts of trinkets.  But Beauty asked for nothing; forshe thought in herself that all the Ship was worth would hardly buyeverything her sisters wished for.  "Beauty," said the merchant, "howcomes it that you ask for nothing: what can I bring you, my child?""Since you are so kind as to think of me, dear father," she answered,"I should be glad if you would bring me a rose, for we have none in ourgarden."  Now Beauty did not indeed wish for a rose, nor anything else,but she only said this that she might not affront her sisters;otherwise they would have said she wanted her father to praise her fordesiring nothing.  The merchant took his leave of them, and set out onhis journey; but when he got to the ship, some persons went to law withhim about the cargo, and after a deal of trouble he came back to hiscottage as poor as he had left it.  When he was within thirty miles ofhis home, and thinking of the joy of again meeting his children, helost his way in the midst of a dense forest.  It rained and snowed veryhard, and, besides, the wind was so high as to throw him twice from hishorse.  Night came on, and he feared he should die of cold and hunger,or be torn to pieces by the wolves that he heard howling round him.All at once, he cast his eyes toward a long avenue, and saw at the enda light, but it seemed a great way off.  He made the best of his waytoward it, and found that it came from a splendid palace, the windowsof which were all blazing with light.  It had great bronze gates,standing wide open, and fine court-yards, through which the merchantpassed; but not a living soul was to be seen.  There were stables, too,which his poor, starved horse, less scrupulous than himself, entered atonce, and took a good meal of oats and hay.  His master then tied himup, and walked toward the entrance hall, but still without seeing asingle creature.  He went on to a large dining parlor, where he found agood fire, and table covered with some very nice dishes, but only oneplate with a knife and fork.  As the snow and rain had wetted him tothe skin, he went up to the fire to dry himself.  "I hope," said he,"the master of the house or his servants will excuse me, for it surelywill not be long now before I see them."  He waited some time, butstill nobody came: at last the clock struck eleven, and the merchant,being quite faint for the want of food, helped himself to a chicken,and to a few glasses of wine, yet all the time trembling with fear.  Hesat till the clock struck twelve, and then, taking courage, began tothink he might as well look about him: so he opened a door at the endof the hall, and went through it into a very grand room, in which therewas a fine bed; and as he was feeling very weary, he shut the door,took off his clothes, and got into it.It was ten o'clock in the morning before he awoke, when he was amazedto see a handsome new suit of clothes laid ready for him, instead ofhis own, which were all torn and spoiled.  "To be sure," said he tohimself, "this place belongs to some good fairy, who has taken pity onmy ill luck."  He looked out of the window, and instead of the snow-covered wood, where he had lost himself the previous night, he saw themost charming arbors covered with all kinds of flowers.  Returning tothe hall where he had supper, he found a breakfast table, readyprepared.  "Indeed, my good fairy," said the merchant aloud, "I amvastly obliged to you for your kind care of me."  He then made a heartybreakfast, took his hat, and was going to the stable to pay his horse avisit; but as he passed under one of the arbors, which was loaded withroses, he thought of what Beauty had asked him to bring back to her,and so he took a bunch of roses to carry home.  At the same moment heheard a loud noise, and saw coming toward him a beast, so frightful tolook at that he was ready to faint with fear.  "Ungrateful man!" saidthe beast in a terrible voice, "I have saved your life by admitting youinto my palace, and in return you steal my roses, which I value morethan anything I possess.  But you shall atone for your fault-die in aquarter of an hour.The merchant fell on his knees, and clasping his hands, said, "Sir, Ihumbly beg your pardon: I did not think it would offend you to gather arose for one of my daughters, who had entreated me to bring her onehome.  Do not kill me, my lord!""I am not a lord, but a beast," replied.  the monster, "I hate falsecompliments: so do not fancy that you can coax me by any such ways.You tell me that you have daughters; now I will suffer you to escape,if one of them will come and die in your stead.  If not, profuse thatyou will yourself return in three months, to be dealt with as I maychoose."The tender-hearted merchant had no thoughts of letting any one of hisdaughters die for his sake; but he knew that if he seemed to accept thebeast's terms, he should at least have the pleasure of seeing them onceagain.  So he gave his promise, and was told that he might then set offas soon as he liked.  "But," said the beast, "I do not wish you to goback empty handed.  Go to the room you slept in, and you will find achest there; fill it with whatsoever you like best, and I will have ittaken to your own house for you."When the beast had said this, he went away.  The good merchant, left tohimself, began to consider that as he must die-for he had no thought ofbreaking a promise, made even to a beast-he might as well have thecomfort of leaving his children provided for.  He returned to the roomhe had slept in, and found there heaps of gold pieces lying about.He filled the chest with them to the very brim, locked it, and,mounting his horse, left the palace as sorrowful as he had been gladwhen he first beheld it.  The horse took a path across the forest ofhis own accord, and in a few hours they reached the merchant's house.His children came running round him, but, instead of kissing them withjoy, he could not help weeping as he looked at them.  He held in hishand the bunch of roses, which he gave to Beauty, saying, "Take theseroses, Beauty; but little do you think how dear they have cost yourpoor father;" and then he gave them an account of all that he had seenor heard in the palace of the beast.The two eldest sisters now began to shed tears, and to lay the blameupon Beauty, who, they said, would be the cause of her father's death."See," said they, "what happens from the pride of the little wretch;why did not she ask for such things as we did?  But, to be sure, Missmust not be like other people; and though she will be the cause of herfather's death, yet she does not shed a tear.""It would be useless," replied Beauty, "for my father shall not die.As the beast will accept one of his daughters, I will give myself up,and be only too happy to prove my love for the best of fathers.""No, sister," said the three brothers with one voice, "that cannot be;we will go in search of this monster, and either he or we will perish.""Do not hope to kill him," said the merchant, "his power is far toogreat.  But Beauty's young life shall not be sacrificed; I am old, andcannot expect to live much longer; so I shall but give up a few yearsof my life, and shall only grieve for the sake of my children.""Never, father!" cried Beauty; "if you go back to the palace, youcannot hinder my going after you; though young, I am not over-fond oflife; and I would much rather be eaten up by the monster, than die ofgrief for your loss."The merchant in vain tried to reason with Beauty who still obstinatelykept to her purpose; which, in truth, made her two sisters glad, forthey were jealous of her, because everybody loved her.The merchant was so grieved at the thoughts of losing his child, thathe never once thought of the chest filled with gold, but at night, tohis great surprise, he found it standing by his bedside.  He saidnothing about his riches to his eldest daughters, for he knew very wellit would at once make them want to return to town; but he told Beautyhis secret, and she then said, that while he was away, two gentlemenhad been on a visit at her cottage, who had fallen in love with her twosisters.  She entreated her father to marry them without delay, for shewas so sweet-natured, she only wished them to be happy.Three months went by, only too fast, and then the merchant and Beautygot ready to set out for the palace of the beast.  Upon this, the twosisters rubbed their eyes with an onion, to make believe they werecrying; both the merchant and his sons cried in earnest.  Only Beautyshed no tears.  They reached the palace in a very few hours, and thehorse, without bidding, went into the stable as before.  The merchantand Beauty walked toward the large hall, where they found a tablecovered with every dainty and two plates laid already.  The merchanthad very little appetite; but Beauty, that she might the better hideher grief, placed herself at the table, and helped her father; she thenbegan to eat herself, and thought all the time that, to be sure, thebeast had a mind to fatten her before he ate her up, since he hadprovided such good cheer for her.  When they had done their supper,they heard a great noise, and the good old man began to bid his poorchild farewell, for he knew it was the beast coming to them.  WhenBeauty first saw that frightful form, she was very much terrified, buttried to hide her fear.  The creature walked up to her, and eyed herall over-then asked her in a dreadful voice if she had come quite ofher own accord."Yes," said Beauty."Then you are a good girl, and I am very much obliged to you."This was such an astonishingly civil answer that Beauty's courage rose:but it sank again when the beast, addressing the merchant, desired himto leave the palace next morning, and never return to it again.  "Andso good-night, merchant.  And good-night, Beauty.""Good-night, beast," she answered, as the monster shuffled out of theroom."Ah!  my dear child," said the merchant, kissing his daughter, "I amhalf dead already, at the thought of leaving you with this dreadfulbeast; you shall go back and let me stay in your place.""No," said Beauty, boldly, "I will never agree to that; you must gohome to-morrow morning."They then wished each other good-night, and went to bed, both of themthinking they should not be able to close their eyes; but as soon asever they had lain down, they fell into a deep sleep, and did not awaketill morning.  Beauty dreamed that a lady came up to her, who said, "Iam very much pleased, Beauty, with the goodness you have shown, inbeing willing to give your life to save that of your father.  Do not beafraid of anything; you shall not go without a reward."As soon as Beauty awoke she told her father this dream; but though itgave him some comfort, he was a long time before he could be persuadedto leave the palace.  At last Beauty succeeded in getting him safelyaway.When her father was out of sight, poor Beauty began to weep sorely;still, having naturally a courageous spirit, she soon resolved not tomake her sad case still worse by sorrow, which she knew was vain, butto wait and be patient.  She walked about to take a view of all thepalace, and the elegance of every part of it much charmed her.But what was her surprise, when she came to a door on which waswritten, BEAUTY'S ROOM!  She opened it in haste, and her eyes weredazzled by the splendor and taste of the apartment.  What made herwonder more than all the rest, was a large library filled with books, aharpsichord, and many pieces of music.  "The beast surely does not meanto eat me up immediately," said she, "since he takes care I shall notbe at a loss how to amuse myself."  She opened the library and sawthese verses written in letters of gold in the back of one of the books"Beauteous lady, dry your tears,Here's no cause for sighs or fears.Command as freely as you may,For you command and I obey.""Alas!" said she, sighing; "I wish I could only command a sight of mypoor father, and to know what he is doing at this moment."  Just then,by chance, she cast her eyes upon a looking-glass that stood near her,and in it she saw a picture of her old home, and her father ridingmournfully up to the door.  Her sisters came out to meet him, andalthough they tried to look sorry, it was easy to see that in theirhearts they were very glad.  In a short time all this picturedisappeared, but it caused Beauty to think that the beast, besidesbeing very powerful, was also very kind.  About the middle of the dayshe found a table laid ready for her, and a sweet concert of musicplayed all the time she was dining, without her seeing anybody.  But atsupper, when she was going to seat herself at table, she heard thenoise of the beast, and could not help trembling with fear."Beauty," said he, "will you give me leave to see you sup?""That is as you please," answered she, very much afraid."Not in the least," said the beast; "you alone command in this place.If you should not like my company, you need only say so, and I willleave you that moment.  But tell me, Beauty, do you not think me veryugly?""'Why, yes," said she, "for I cannot tell a falsehood; but then I thinkyou are very good.""Am I?" sadly replied the beast; "yet, besides being ugly, I am alsovery stupid; I know well enough that I am but a beast.""Very stupid people," said Beauty, "are never aware of it themselves."At which kindly speech the beast looked pleased, and replied, notwithout an awkward sort of politeness, "Pray do not let me detain youfrom supper, and be sure that you are well served.  All you see is yourown, and I should be deeply grieved if you wanted for anything.""You are very kind-so kind that I almost forgot you are so ugly," saidBeauty, earnestly."Ah! yes," answered the beast, with a great sigh; "I hope I am good-tempered, but still I am only a monster.""There is many a monster who wears the form of a man; it is better ofthe two to have the heart of a man and the form of a monster.""I would thank you, Beauty, for this speech, but I am too senseless tosay anything that would please you," returned the beast in a melancholyvoice; and altogether he seemed so gentle and so unhappy that Beauty,who had the tenderest heart in the world, felt her fear of himgradually vanish.She ate her supper with a good appetite, and conversed in her ownsensible and charming way, till at last, when the beast rose to depart,he terrified her more than ever by saying abruptly, in his gruff voice,"Beauty, will you marry me?"Now Beauty, frightened as she was, would speak only the exact truth;besides her father had told her that the beast liked only to have thetruth spoken to him.  So she answered, in a very firm tone, "No,beast."He did not get into a passion, or do anything but sigh deeply, anddepart.When Beauty found herself alone, she began to feel pity for the poorbeast.  "Oh!" said she, "what a sad thing it is that he should be sovery frightful, since he is so good-tempered!"Beauty lived three months in this palace very well pleased.  The beastcame to see her every night, and talked with her while she supped; andthough what he said was not very clever, yet, as she saw in him everyday some new goodness, instead of dreading the time of his coming, shesoon began continually looking at her watch, to see if it were nineo'clock; for that was the hour when he never failed to visit her.  Onething only vexed her, which was that every night before he went away,he always made it a rule to ask her if she would be his wife, andseemed very much grieved at her steadfastly replying "No."  At last,one night, she said to him, "You wound me greatly, beast, by forcing meto refuse you so often; I wish I could take such a liking to you as toagree to marry you; but I must tell you plainly that I do not think itwill ever happen.  I shall always be your friend; so try to let thatcontent you."I must," sighed the beast, "for I know well enough how frightful I am;but I love you better than myself.  Yet I think I am very lucky in yourbeing pleased to stay with me; now promise, Beauty, that you will neverleave me.Beauty would almost have agreed to this, so sorry was she for him, butshe had that day seen in her magic glass, which she looked atconstantly, that her father was dying of grief for her sake."Alas!" she said, "I long so much to see my father, that if you do notgive me leave to visit him, I shall break my heart.""I would rather break mine, Beauty," answered the beast; "I will sendyou to your father's cottage: you shall stay there, and your poor beastshall die of sorrow.""No," said Beauty, crying, "I love you too well to be the cause of yourdeath; I promise to return in a week.  You have shown me that mysisters are married, and my brothers are gone for soldiers, so that myfather is left all alone.  Let me stay a week with him.""You shall find yourself with him to-morrow morning," replied thebeast; "but mind, do not forget your promise.  When you wish to return,you have nothing to do but to put your ring on a table when you go tobed.  Good-by, Beauty!"  The beast sighed as he said these words, andBeauty went to bed very sorry to see him so much grieved.  When sheawoke in the morning, she found herself in her father's cottage.  Sherang a bell that was at her bedside, and a servant entered; but as soonas she saw Beauty the woman gave a loud shriek; upon which the merchantran upstairs, and when he beheld his daughter he ran to her, and kissedher a hundred times.  At last Beauty began to remember that she hadbrought no clothes with her to put on; but the servant told her she hadjust found in the next room a large chest full of dresses, trimmed allover with gold, and adorned within pearls and diamonds.Beauty, in her own mind, thanked the beast for his kindness, and put onthe plainest gown she could find among them all.  She then desired theservant to lay the rest aside, for she intended to give them to hersisters; but, as soon as she had spoken these words, the chest was goneout of sight in a moment.  Her father then suggested, perhaps the beastchose for her to keep them all for herself: and as soon as he had saidthis, they saw the chest standing again in the same place.  WhileBeauty was dressing herself, a servant brought word to her that hersisters were come with their husbands to pay her a visit.  They bothlived unhappily with the gentlemen they had married.  The husband ofthe eldest was very handsome, but was so proud of this that he thoughtof nothing else from morning till night, and did not care a pin for thebeauty of his wife.  The second had married a man of great learning;but he made no use of it, except to torment and affront all hisfriends, and his wife more than any of them.  The two sisters wereready to burst with spite when they saw Beauty dressed like a princess,and looking so very charming.  All the kindness that she showed themwas of no use; for they were vexed more than ever when she told themhow happy she lived at the palace of the beast.  The spiteful creatureswent by themselves into the garden, where they cried to think of hergood fortune."Why should the little wretch be better off than we?" said they.  "Weare much handsomer than she is.""Sister!" said the eldest, "a thought has just come into my head; letus try to keep her here longer than the week for which the beast gaveher leave; and then he will be so angry that perhaps when she goes backto him he will eat her up in a moment.''"That is well thought of," answered the other, "but to do this, we mustpretend to be very kind."They then went to join her in the cottage, where they showed her somuch false love that Beauty could not help crying for joy.When the week was ended, the two sisters began to pretend such grief atthe thought of her leaving them that she agreed to stay a week more;but all that time Beauty could not help fretting for the sorrow thatshe knew her absence would give her poor beast for she tenderly lovedhim, and much wished for his company again.  Among all the grand andclever people she saw, she found nobody who was half so sensible, soaffectionate, so thoughtful, or so kind.  The tenth night of her beingat the cottage, she dreamed she was in the garden of the palace, thatthe beast lay dying on a grass plot, and with his last breath put herin mind of her promise, and laid his death to her forsaking him.Beauty awoke in a great fright, and she burst into tears.  "Am not Iwicked," said she, "to behave so ill to a beast who has shown me somuch kindness?  Why will I not marry him?  I am sure I should be morehappy with him than my sisters are with their husbands.  He shall notbe wretched any longer on my account; for I should do nothing but blamemyself all the rest of my life."She then rose, put her ring on the table, got into bed again, and soonfell asleep.  In the morning she with joy found herself in the palaceof the beast.  She dressed herself very carefully, that she mightplease him the better, and thought she had never known a day pass awayso slowly.  At last the clock struck nine, but the beast did not come.Beauty, dreading lest she might truly have caused his death, ran fromroom to room, calling out: "Beast, dear beast;" but there was noanswer.  At last she remembered her dream, rushed to the grass plot,and there saw him lying apparently dead beside the fountain.Forgetting all his ugliness, she threw herself upon his body, andfinding his heart still beating, she fetched some water and sprinkledit over him, weeping and sobbing the while.The beast opened his eyes.  "You forgot your promise, Beauty, and so Idetermined to die; for I could not live without you.  I have starvedmyself to death, but I shall die content since I have seen your faceonce more.""No, dear beast," cried Beauty, passionately, "you shall not die; youshall live to be my husband.  I thought it was only friendship I feltfor you, but now I know it was love."The moment Beauty had spoken these words, the palace was suddenlylighted up, and all kinds of rejoicings were heard around them, none ofwhich she noticed, but hung over her dear beast with the utmosttenderness.  At last, unable to restrain herself, she dropped her headover her hands, covered her eyes, and cried for joy; and, when shelooked up again, the beast was gone.  In his stead she saw at her feeta handsome, graceful young prince, who thanked her with the tenderestexpressions for having freed him from enchantment."But where is my poor beast?  I only want him and nobody else," sobbedBeauty."I am he," replied the prince.  "A wicked fairy condemned me to thisform, and forbade me to show that I had any wit or sense, till abeautiful lady should consent to marry me.  You alone, dearest Beauty,judged me neither by my looks nor by my talents, but by my heart alone.Take it then, and all that I have besides, for all is yours."Beauty, full of surprise, but very happy, suffered the prince to leadher to his palace, where she found her father and sisters, who had beenbrought there by the fairy-lady whom she had seen in a dream the firstnight she came."Beauty," said the fairy, "you have chosen well, and you have yourreward, for a true heart is better than either good looks or cleverbrains.  As for you, ladies," and she turned to the two elder sisters,"I know all your ill deeds, but I have no worse punishment for you thanto see your sister happy.  You shall stand as statues at the door ofher palace, and when you repent of, and have amended your faults, youshall become women again.  But, to tell you the truth, I very much fearyou will remain statues forever."JACK AND THE BEANSTALKAnonymousONCE upon a time there was a poor widow who lived in a little cottagewith her only son Jack.Jack was a giddy, thoughtless boy, but very kindhearted andaffectionate.  There had been a hard winter, and after it the poorwoman had suffered from fever and ague.  Jack did no work as yet, andby degrees they grew dreadfully poor.  The widow saw that there was nomeans of keeping Jack and herself from starvation but by selling hercow; so one morning she said to her son, "I am too weak to go myself,Jack, so you must take the cow to market for me, and sell her."Jack liked going to market to sell the cow very much; but as he was onhis way, he met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand.Jack stopped to look at them, and the butcher told the boy that theywere of great value, and persuaded the silly lad to sell the cow forthese beans.  When he brought them home to his mother instead of themoney she expected for her nice cow, she was very vexed and shed manytears, scolding Jack for his folly.  He was very sorry, and mother andson went to bed very sadly that night; their last hope seemed gone.At daybreak Jack rose and went out into the garden."At least," he thought, "I will sow the wonderful beans.  Mother saysthat they are just common scarlet-runners, and nothing else; but I mayas well sow them."So he took a piece of stick, and made some holes in the ground, and putin the beans.That day they had very little dinner, and went sadly to bed, knowingthat for the next day there would be none, and Jack, unable to sleepfrom grief and vexation, got up at day-dawn and went out into thegarden.What was his amazement to find that the beans had grown up in thenight, and climbed up and up till they covered the high cliff thatsheltered the cottage, and disappeared above it!  The stalks had twinedand - twisted themselves together till they formed quite a ladder."It would be easy to climb it," thought Jack.And, having thought of the experiment, he at once resolved to carry itout, for Jack was a good climber.  However, after his late mistakeabout the cow, he thought he had better consult his mother first.So Jack called his mother, and they both gazed in silent wonder at theBeanstalk, which was not only of great height, but it was thick enoughto bear Jack's weight."I wonder where it ends," said Jack to his mother; "I think I willclimb up and see."His mother wished him not to venture up this strange ladder, but Jackcoaxed her to give her consent to the attempt, for he was certain theremust be something wonderful in the Beanstalk; so at last she yielded tohis wishes.Jack instantly began to climb, and went up and up on the ladder-likebean till everything he had left behind him-the cottage, the village,and even the tall church tower-looked quite little, and still he couldnot see the top of the Beanstalk.Jack felt a little tired, and thought for a moment that he would goback again; but he was a very persevering boy, and he knew that the wayto succeed in anything is not to give up.  So, after resting for amoment, he went on.After climbing higher and higher, till he grew afraid to look down forfear he should be giddy, Jack at last reached the top of the Beanstalk,and found himself in a beautiful country, finely wooded, with beautifulmeadows covered with sheep.  A crystal stream ran through the pastures;not far from the place where he had got off the Beanstalk stood a fine,strong castle.Jack wondered very much that he had never heard of or seen this castlebefore; but when he reflected on the subject, he saw that it was asmuch separated from the village by the perpendicular rock on which itstood as if it were in another land.While Jack was standing looking at the castle, a very strange-lookingwoman came out of the wood and advanced toward him.She wore a pointed cap of quilted red satin turned up with ermine, herhair streamed loose over her shoulders, and she walked with a staff.Jack took off his cap and made her a bow."If you please, ma'am," said he, "is this your house?""No," said the old lady.  "Listen, and I will tell you the story ofthat castle.""Once upon a time there was a noble knight, who lived in this castle,which is on the borders of Fairyland.  He had a fair and beloved wifeand several lovely children; and as his neighbors, the little people,were very friendly toward him, they bestowed on him many excellent andprecious gifts."Rumor whispered of these treasures; and a monstrous giant who lived ata great distance, and who was a very wicked being, resolved to obtainpossession of them."So he bribed a false servant to let him inside the castle, when theknight was in bed and asleep, and he killed him as he lay.  Then hewent to the part of the castle which was the nursery, and also killedall the poor little ones he found there."Happily for her, the lady was not to be found.  She had gone with herinfant son, who was only two or three months old, to visit her oldnurse, who lived in the valley; and she had been detained all nightthere by a storm."The next morning, as soon as it was light, one of the servants at thecastle, who had managed to escape, came to tell the poor lady of thesad fate of her husband and her pretty babes.  She could scarcelybelieve him at first, and was eager at once to go back and share thefate of her dear ones; but the old nurse, with many tears, besought herto remember that she had still a child, and that it was her duty topreserve her life for the sake of the poor innocent."The lady yielded to this reasoning, and consented to remain at hernurse's house as the best place of concealment; for the servant toldher that the Giant had vowed, if he could find her, he would kill bothher and her baby.  Years rolled on.  The old nurse died, leaving hercottage and the few articles of furniture it contained to her poorlady, who dwelt in it, working as a peasant for her daily bread.  Herspinning-wheel and the milk of a cow which she had purchased with thelittle money she had with her, sufficed for the scanty subsistence ofherself and her little son.  There was a nice little garden attached tothe cottage, in which they cultivated peas, beans, and cabbages, andthe lady was not ashamed to go out at harvest time and glean in thefields to supply her little son's wants."Jack, that poor lady is your mother.  This castle was once yourfather's, and must again be yours.Jack uttered a cry of surprise."My mother!  oh, madam, what ought I to do?  My poor father!  My dearmother!""Your duty requires you to win it back for your mother.  But the taskis a very difficult one, and full of peril, Jack.  Have you courage toundertake it?"  "I fear nothing when I am doing right," said Jack."Then," said the lady in the red cap, "you are one of those who slaygiants.  You must get into the castle, and if possible possess yourselfof a hen that lays golden eggs, and a harp that talks.  Remember, allthe Giant possesses is really yours."As she ceased speaking, the lady of the red hat suddenly disappeared,and of course Jack knew she was a fairy.Jack determined at once to attempt the adventure; so he advanced, andblew the horn which hung at the castle portal.  The door was opened ina minute or two by a frightful Giantess, with one great eye in themiddle of her forehead.As soon as Jack saw her he turned to run away, but she caught him, anddragged him into the castle."Ho, ho!" she laughed terribly.  "You didn't expect to see me here,that is clear!  No, I shan't let you go again.  I am weary of my life.I am so overworked, and I don't see why I should not have a page aswell as other ladies.  And you shall be my boy.  You shall clean theknives, and black the boots, and make the fires, and help me generallywhen the Giant is out.  When he is at home I must hide you, for he haseaten up all my pages hitherto, and you would be a dainty morsel, mylittle lad."While she spoke she dragged Jack right into the castle.  The poor boywas very much frightened, as I am sure you and I would have been in hisplace.  But he remembered that fear disgraces a man; so he struggled tobe brave and make the best of things.  "I am quite ready to help you,and do all I can to serve you, madam," he said, "only I beg you will begood enough to hide me from your husband, for I should not like to beeaten at all.""That's a good boy," said the Giantess, nodding her head; "it is luckyfor you that you did not scream out when you saw me, as the other boyswho have been here did, for if you had done so my husband would haveawakened and have eaten you, as he did them, for breakfast.  Come here,child; go into my wardrobe: he never ventures to open that; you will besafe there."And she opened a huge wardrobe which stood in the great hall, and shuthim unto it.  But the keyhole was so large that it admitted plenty ofair, and he could see everything that took place through it.  By and byhe heard a heavy tramp on the stairs, like the lumbering along of agreat cannon, and then a voice like thunder cried out:"Fe, fa, fi-fo-fum,I smell the breath of an Englishman.Let him be alive or let him be dead,I'll grind his bones to make my bread.""Wife," cried the Giant, "there is a man in the castle.  Let me havehim for breakfast.""You are grown old and stupid," cried the lady, in her loud tones.  "Itis only a nice fresh steak off an elephant, that I have cooked for you,which you smell.  There, sit down and make a good breakfast."And she placed a huge dish before him of savory steaming meat, whichgreatly pleased him, and made him forget his idea of an Englishmanbeing in the castle.  When he had breakfasted he went out for a walk,and then the Giantess opened the door, and made Jack come out to helpher.  He helped her all day.  She fed him well, and when evening cameput him back in the wardrobe.The Giant came in to supper.  Jack watched him through the keyhole, andwas amazed to see him pick a wolf's bone, and put half a fowl at a timeinto his capacious mouth.When the supper was ended he bade his wife bring him his hen that laidthe golden eggs."It lays as well as it did when it belonged to that paltry knight," hesaid; "indeed, I think the eggs are heavier than ever."The Giantess went away, and soon returned with a little brown hen,which she placed on the table before her husband."And now, my dear," she said, "I am going for a walk, if you don't wantme any longer.""Go, said the Giant; "I shall be glad to have a nap by and by."Then he took up the brown hen and said to her:"Lay!" And she instantly laid a golden egg."Lay!" said the Giant again.  And she laid another."Lay!" he repeated the third time.  And again a golden egg lay on thetable.Now, Jack was sure this hen was that of which the fairy had spoken.By and by the Giant put the hen down on the floor, and soon after wentfast asleep, snoring so loud that it sounded like thunder.Directly Jack perceived that the Giant was fast asleep, he pushed openthe door of the wardrobe and crept out; very softly he stole across theroom, and, picking up the hen, made haste to quit the apartment.  heknew the way to the kitchen, the door of which he found was left ajar;he opened it, shut and locked it after him, and flew back to theBeanstalk, which he descended as fast as his feet would move.When his mother saw him enter the house she wept for joy, for she hadfeared that the fairies had carried him away, or that the Giant hadfound him.  But Jack put the brown hen down before her, and told herhow he had been in the Giant's castle, and all his adventures.  She wasvery glad to see the hen, which would make them rich once more.Jack made another journey up the Beanstalk to the Giant's castle oneday while his mother had gone to market; but first he dyed his hair anddisguised himself.  The old woman did not know him again, and draggedhim in as she had done before, to help her to do the work; but sheheard her husband coming, and hid him in the wardrobe, not thinkingthat it was the same boy who had stolen the hen.  She bade him stayquite still there, or the Giant would eat him.  Then the Giant came in,saying:"Fe, fa, fi-fo-furn,I smell the breath of an Englishman.Let him he alive or let him be dead,I'll grind his bones to make my bread.""Nonsense!" said the wife, "it is only a roasted bullock that I thoughtwould be a titbit for your supper; sit down and I will bring it up atonce.The Giant sat down, and soon his wife brought up a roasted bullock on alarge dish, and they began their supper.  Jack was amazed to see thempick the bones of the bullock as if it had been a lark.  As soon asthey had finished their meal, the Giantess rose and said:"Now, my dear, with your leave I am going up to my room to finish thestory I am reading.  If you want me, call for me.""First," answered the Giant, "bring me my money bags, that I may countmy golden pieces before I sleep."  The Giantess obeyed.  She went andsoon returned with two large bags over her shoulders, which she putdown by her husband."There," she said: "that is all that is left of the knight's money.When you have spent it you must go and take another baron's castle.""That he shan't, if I can help it," thought Jack.The Giant, when his wife was gone, took out heaps and heaps of goldenpieces, and counted them, and put them in piles, till he was tired ofthe amusement.  Then he swept them all back into their bags, andleaning back in his chair fell fast asleep, snoring so loud that noother sound was audible.Jack stole softly out of the wardrobe, and taking up the bags of money(which were his very own, because the Giant had stolen them from hisfather), he ran off, and with great difficulty descending theBeanstalk, laid the bags of gold on his mother's table.  She had justreturned from town, and was crying at not finding Jack.  "There,mother, I have brought you the gold that my father lost.""Oh, Jack!  you are a very good boy, but I wish you would not risk yourprecious life in the Giant's castle.  Tell me how you came to go thereagain."And Jack told her all about it.Jack's mother was very glad to get the money, but she did not like himto run any risk for her.But after a time Jack made up his mind to go again to the Giant'scastle.So he climbed the Beanstalk once more, and blew the horn at the Giant'sgate.  The Giantess soon opened the door; she was very stupid, and didnot know him again,.  but she stopped a minute before she took him in.She feared another robbery; but Jack's fresh face looked so innocentthat she could not resist him, and so she bade him come in, and againhid him away in the wardrobe.By and by the Giant came home, and as soon as he had crossed thethreshold he roared out: "Fe, fa, li-fo-fum,I smell the breath of an Englishman.Let him be alive or let him be dead,I'll grind his bones to make my bread.""You stupid old Giant," said his wife, "you only smell a nice sheep,which I have grilled for your dinner.'And the Giant sat down, and his wife brought up a whole sheep for hisdinner.  When he had eaten it all up, he said:"Now bring me my harp, and I will have a little music while you takeyour walk."The Giantess obeyed, and returned with a beautiful harp.  The frameworkwas all sparkling with diamonds and rubies, and the strings were all ofgold."This is one of the nicest things I took from the knight," Said theGiant.  "I am very fond of music, and my harp is a faithful servant."So he drew the harp toward him  and said:"Play!"And the harp played a very soft, sad air."Play something merrier!" said the Giant.And the harp played a merry tune."Now play me a lullaby," roared the Giant; and the harp played a sweetlullaby, to the sound of which its master fell asleep.Then Jack stole softly out of the wardrobe, and went into the hugekitchen to see if the Giantess had gone out; he found no one there, sohe went to the door and opened it softly, for he thought he could notdo so with the harp in his hand.Then he entered the Giant's room and seized the harp and ran away withit; but as he jumped over the threshold the harp called out: "MASTER!MASTER!"And the Giant woke up.With a tremendous roar he sprang from his seat, and in two strides hadreached the door.But Jack was very nimble.  He fled like lightning with the harp,talking to it as he went (for he saw it was a fairy), and telling it hewas the son of its old master, the knight.Still the Giant came on so fast that he was quite close to poor Jack,and had stretched out his great hand to catch him.  But, luckily, justat that moment he stepped upon a loose stone, stumbled, and fell flaton the ground, where he lay at his full length.This accident gave Jack time to get on the Bean stalk and hasten downit; but just as he reached their own garden he beheld the Giantdescending after him."Mother!  mother!" cried Jack, "make haste and give me the ax."His mother ran to him with a hatchet in her hand, and Jack with onetremendous blow cut through all the Beanstalks except one."Now, mother, stand out of the way!" said he.  Jack's mother shrankback, and it was well she did so, for just as the Giant took hold ofthe last branch of the Beanstalk, Jack cut the stem quite through anddarted from the spot.Down came the Giant with a terrible crash, and as he fell on his head,he broke his neck, and lay dead at the feet of the woman he had so muchinjured.Before Jack and his mother had recovered from their alarm andagitation, a beautiful lady stood before them."Jack," said she, "you have acted like a brave knight's son, anddeserve to have your inheritance restored to you.  Dig a grave and burythe Giaint, and then go and kill the Giantess.""But," said Jack, "I could not kill any one unless I were fighting withhim; and I could not draw my sword upon a woman.  Moreover, theGiantess was very kind to me."The Fairy smiled on Jack."I am very much pleased with your generous feeling," she said."Nevertheless, return to the castle, and act as you will find needful."Jack asked the Fairy if she would show him the way to the castle, asthe Beanstalk was now down.  She told him that she would drive himthere in her chariot, which was drawn by two peacocks.  Jack thankedher, and sat down in the chariot with her.The Fairy drove him a long distance round, till they reached a villagewhich lay at the bottom of the mill.  Here they found a number ofmiserable-looking men assembled.  The Fairy stopped her carriage andaddressed them:"My friends," said she, "the cruel Giant who oppressed you and ate upall your flocks and herds is dead, and this young gentleman was themeans of your being delivered from him, and is the son of your kind oldmaster, the knight."The men gave a loud cheer at these words, and pressed forward to saythat they would serve Jack as faithfully as they had served his father.The Fairy bade them follow her to the castle, and they marched thitherin a body, and Jack blew the horn and demanded admittance.The old Giantess saw them coming from the turret loophole.  She wasvery much frightened, for she guessed that something had happened toher husband; and as she came downstairs very fast she caught her footin her dress, and fell from the top to the bottom and broke her neck.When the people outside found that the door was not opened to them,they took crowbars and forced the portal.  Nobody was to be seen, buton leaving the mall they found the body of the Giantess at the foot ofthe stairs.Thus Jack took possession of the castle.  The Fairy went and broughthis mother to him, with the hen and the harp.  He had the Giantessburied, and endeavored as much as lay in his power to do right to thosewhom the Giant had robbed.Before her departure for fairyland, the Fairy explained to Jack thatshe had sent the butcher to meet him with the beans, in order to trywhat sort of lad he was."If you had looked at the gigantic Beanstalk and only stupidly wonderedabout it," she said, "I should have left you where misfortune hadplaced you, only restoring her cow to your mother.  But you showed aninquiring mind, and great courage and enterprise, therefore you deserveto rise; and when you mounted the Beanstalk you climbed the Ladder ofFortune."She then took her leave of Jack and his mother.HOP-O'-MY-THUMBRetold by Joseph JacobsONCE upon a time there was a Wood-cutter and his wife who had sevenchildren, all boys.  The eldest was only ten years old.  They were verypoor, and their seven children were a great burden, since not one ofthem was able to earn his living.What troubled them still more was the fact that the youngest was notonly very delicate, but silent, which they took for stupidity, butwhich was really a mark of his good sense.  He was very small, and whenhe was born he was scarcely bigger than one's thumb, which caused himto be called little "Hop-o'-My-Thumb."  This poor child was thescapegoat of the house, and was blamed for everything.  He was,however, sharper and wiser than all his brothers, and though he spokelittle, he listened a great deal.At last there came a bad year, and so great a famine, that the poorpeople resolved to rid themselves of their children.  One evening, whenthe children were all in bed, and the Wood-cutter with a sorrowfulheart, was sitting by the fire with his wife, he said to her: "You knowthat we can no longer support our children.  I cannot let them die ofhunger before my eyes, and I am resolved to take them to the wood to-morrow, and lose them.  It will be easy to do this, for, while theyamuse themselves tying my sticks, we have only to slip away withouttheir seeing us."Ah!" cried his Wife, "would you then destroy your children?"   In vaindid her husband set forth to her their great poverty: she would notconsent.  She was poor, she said.  But she was their mother.  At last,having considered what a grief it would be to her to have them die ofhunger before her eyes, she agreed to her husband's plan, and went,weeping, to bed.Hop-o'-My-Thumb had listened to all that they had said, for havingheard them, from his bed, talking of family matters, he had risensoftly and slipped under his father's stool, in order to hear withoutbeing seen.  He then went back to bed, but lay awake the rest of thenight, thinking what he should do.  He rose early and went to a brook,where he filled his pocket with little white pebbles, and then returnedto the house.Soon after, they all set off, but Hop-o'-My-Thumb did not tell hisbrothers anything of what he knew.  They went into a forest, so thickthat they could not see each other at a distance of ten paces.  TheWood-cutter began to fell a tree, while the children gathered sticks tomake up into bundles.  The father and mother, seeing them thusemployed, slipped away unnoticed, and then fled rapidly, by a littlewinding path.When the children found they were alone, they began to scream and crywith all their strength.  Hop-o'-My-Thumb let them cry, knowing wellhow to get home; for, while walking, he had dropped along the path thelittle white pebbles which he had in his pockets.He therefore said to them, "Fear not, brothers, my father and motherhave left us here, but I will lead you to the house only follow me."They obeyed at once, and he led them home along the same path by whichthey had come into the forest at first.  They did not dare to go intothe house, but placed themselves near the door, in order to hear whattheir father and mother were saying.Now it had so happened that, just as the Woodcutter and his Wifereached home, the lord of the village had sent them ten crowns, whichhe had long owed them, and which they had never hoped to obtain.  Thisgave them new life, for the poor creatures were almost dead fromhunger.The Wood-cutter immediately sent his Wife to the butcher's, where, asit was long since they had eaten anything, she bought three times asmuch meat as was needed for the supper of two people.When they were seated at table, the Wife said, "Alas!  where now areour poor children?  They would make good cheer with what we have left.But it is you who wished to lose them.  I always said we should repentit.  What are they doing now in the forest?  Alas!  alas!  perhaps thewolves have already eaten them!  You were most cruel thus to lose yourchildren."The Wood-cutter at last grew impatient, for she repeated more thantwenty times that they would repent what they had done, and that shehad told him so.  He threatened to beat her if she was not silent.  TheWood-cutter did not do this because he was less sorry than his Wife,but because her reproaches angered him.  His Wife now shed tears, andcried out, "Alas!  where are my children, my poor children?"She said this so loud that the children, who were at the door, heardher, and all cried out together, "Here we are!  here we are!"She ran quickly to open the door, and said, as she embraced them, "Howoverjoyed I am to see you again, my darling children!  you must be verytired and very hungry; and you, Peter, how muddy you are!  come, let mebrush you."  Peter was her eldest son, whom she loved more than all theothers.The children then sat down at the table, and ate with an appetite whichdelighted their father and mother, to whom they described, all speakingat once, how frightened they had been in the forest.These good people were filled with joy to have their children with themagain, and this joy lasted as long as the ten crowns held out.  Butwhen the money was spent, they fell back into their former misery, andresolved to lose them once more; and in order not to fail again, theydetermined to take them much further into the forest than the firsttime.They could not, however, speak of this so secretly but that they wereoverheard by Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who laid his plans to escape as before.Although he got up early in order to go out and pick up some littlestones, he could not succeed in his purpose, for he found the door ofthe house shut and double-bolted.  He was wondering what he should do,when, his mother having given them each a bit of bread for breakfast,he thought that he might use his bread instead of pebbles by droppingcrumbs along the paths as they walked.  He therefore slipped the breadinto his pocket.Their father and mother led them this time into the thickest anddarkest part of the forest, and, as soon as they were there, ran awayand left them.Hop-o'-My-Thumb was not much troubled, because he believed he couldeasily find his way by means of the bread which he had scattered as hepassed along.  What was his surprise when he could not find a singlecrumb: the birds had come and eaten it all.Now was their lot indeed wretched; the more they wandered about, thedeeper they buried themselves in the forest.  Night came, and a greatwind arose which frightened them terribly.  They thought they heard onall sides the howling of hungry wolves coming to eat them up.  They didnot dare to speak, or even turn their heads.  Rain began to fall, whichwet them to the skin.  They slipped at every step, and, if they fell,got up so covered with mud that they could hardly move their hands.Finally, Hop-o'-My-Thumb climbed to the top of a tree, to see if hecould not discover something.  Having looked on all sides, he at lastsaw a little gleam of light, like that from a candle, but it was veryfar off, beyond the forest.  He got down from the tree: but when he wason the ground he no longer saw anything, which troubled him greatly.However, having walked for some time with his brothers in the directionwhere he had seen the light, he again saw it as they came out of thewood.  At last they reached the house where the candle was, though notwithout many alarms, for they lost sight of it whenever they descendedunto a hollow place.They knocked at the door, which was opened to them by a woman.  Sheasked them what they wanted.  Hop-o'-My-Thumb replied that they werepoor children who had lost themselves in the forest, and who asked, forcharity's sake, a place to sleep.The woman, seeing how bitter they were, began to weep, and said tothem, "Alas!  my poor children, whence do you come?  Do you not knowthat this is the house of an Ogre, who eats little children?""Alas, madam," said Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who like his brothers was shakingwith fear, "what shall we do?  The wolves of the forest will certainlydevour us to-night, if you will not give us shelter.  This being thecase, we had rather be eaten by the Ogre, and he, perhaps, will takepity on us, if you will beg him to do so."The Ogre's wife, who thought she might be able to conceal them from herhusband till the next morning, let them come in, and placed them near agood fire, where a whole sheep was roasting for the Ogre's supper.When they had begun to get warm, they heard three or four heavy knocksat the door.  It was the Ogre.  His wife hastily hid the children underthe bed, and then opened the door.The Ogre asked first if supper was ready, and the wine drawn; and thensat down at the table.  The mutton was nearly raw, but he liked it allthe better on that account.He then began to sniff about, saying that he smelled fresh meat."It must be this calf which I have just been dressing that you smell,"said the wife."I smell fresh meat, I tell you again," said the Ogre, looking fiercelyat his wife; "and there is something more of which I do not know."Saying these words, he rose from the table and went straight to thebed, where he found the poor children."Ah!" said he, "this, then, is the way you wish to deceive me, wickedwoman.  I know not what prevents me from eating you, too.  Here isgame, which comes to me very conveniently to treat three Ogres of myacquaintance, who are coming to visit me about this time."He then drew the little boys from under the bed, one after another.The poor children threw themselves on their knees begging for pardon.But they had to do with the most cruel of all the Ogres, who, far fromhaving pity, devoured them already with his eyes, and said to his wifethat they would be delicious morsels fried, when she had made a goodsauce for them.He took out a great knife, and, approaching the poor children, began tosharpen it on a long stone, which he held in his left hand.  He thenseized one of them, when his wife said to him, "Why do you begin atthis time of night?  Shall you not have time to-morrow?""Be silent," replied the Ogre; "they will be more tender if I kill themnow.""But you have already so much meat on hand," replied his wife.  "Hereare a calf, two sheep, and half a pig.""You are right," said the Ogre; "give them a good supper, that they maynot grow thin, and put them to bed."The good woman was overcome with joy, and brought them their supper atonce; but they were too frightened to eat.As for the Ogre, he set himself to drinking, delighted to havesomething with which to regale his friends.  He drank a dozen cups morethan usual, which went to his head, and obliged him to go early to bed.Now this Ogre had seven daughters, who were still only children.  Theselittle Ogresses all had beautiful complexions, for they ate fresh meatlike their father.  They had little round gray eyes, crooked noses, andgreat mouths filled with long teeth, very sharp and far apart.  Theywere not yet very wicked, but they promised well, for they already bitlittle children whenever they got the chance.  They had been put to bedearly, and were all seven in one bed, each having a golden crown on herhead.There was in the same room anther bed of the same size.  Here it wasthat the Ogre's wife put the seven little boy's, after which she wentto bed in her own chamber.Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who had remarked that the Ogre's daughters had goldencrowns on their heads, was afraid that the Ogre might regret not havingkilled him and his brothers that evening.  So he rose about the middleof the night, and, taking his nightcap and those of his brothers, hewent very softly and placed them on the heads of the Ogre's sevendaughters, after having removed their golden crowns.  He then put thecrowns on his brothers' heads and on his own, so that the Ogre mightmistake them for his daughters, and his daughters for the boys whom hewished to kill.The plan succeeded as he had expected.  The Ogre, having awakened aboutmidnight, was sorry that he had put off till next day what he mighthave done that evening.  He jumped quickly out of bed, and, taking hisgreat knife, "Let us see," said he, "how our little friends are gettingon."He went on tiptoe to the room of his daughters, and approached the bedwhere the little boys were all asleep, except Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who wasterribly frightened when he felt the Ogre's hand touching his head, ashe had already touched his brothers'.  But when the Ogre felt thegolden crowns, he said, "Indeed, I was near making a nice piece of workof it.  I see that I drank too much in the evening."He then went to the bed of his daughters, where he felt the boys'little nightcaps.  "Ah!  here they are," said he, "the fine fellows!  Imust go boldly to work.  Saying these words, and without hesitating, hecut the throats of his seven daughters.  Very well pleased with hisexpedition, he went back to bed.  As soon as Hop-o'-My-Thumb heard theOgre snoring, he awakened his brothers, and told them to dressthemselves quickly and follow him.  They went softly down unto thegarden, and leaped over the walls.  They hurried away, and ran almostall night, without knowing whither they went.The Ogre, when he woke up, said to his wife, "Go upstairs and dressthose little fellows who were here last night.''The Ogress was very much astonished at the kindness of her husband, notsuspecting for a moment the way in which he meant that she should dressthem.  Believing that he simply wished her to put on their clothes, shewent upstairs, where she was amazed to see her seven daughters withtheir throats cut.  She was so overcome that she immediately fainted.The Ogre, thinking his wife was too slow, went upstairs to assist her.He was no less astonished than his wife when the frightful sight methis eyes."Ah!  what have I done here?" he cried; "but those little wretchesshall pay for this, and at once."He then threw a bucket of water into his wife's face, and, havingrevived her, said, "Give me quickly my seven-league boots, that I maygo after those boys and catch them."He then started out into the country at once, and, having rushed aboutin all directions, came at last to the road where the poor childrenwere walking, and then not more than a hundred steps from theirfather's house.  They saw the Ogre striding from mountain to mountain,and crossing rivers as if they were little brooks.Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who saw a hollow rock near the place where they were,hid himself and his six brothers there, and watched carefully whatbecame of their enemy.  The Ogre, who was very tired with his long andfruitless journey, wished to rest himself, and sat down, by chance, onthe very rock where the little boys were hidden.As he was overcome with fatigue, he soon fell asleep, and began tosnore so frightfully that the poor children were as much frightened aswhen he held his knife ready to cut their throats.  Hop-o'-My-Thumb wasless afraid, and told his brothers to run into the house while the Ogreslept, and not to worry about him.  They followed his counsel, andquickly reached the house.Hop-o'-My-Thumb then approached the Ogre, softly drew off his boots,and put them on himself.  The boots were very long and very large; but,as they were fairy boots, they had the gift of becoming larger orsmaller, according to the size of the wearer's leg.  In fact, theyfitted Hop-o'-My-Thumb as if they had been made for him.He then went straight to the Ogre's house, where he found his wifeweeping over her daughters."Your husband," said Hop-o'-My-Thumb, "is in great danger, for he hasbeen taken by a band of robbers, who will kill him if he does not givethem all his gold and silver.  Just when they held their knives to histhroat he perceived me, and besought me to come and tell you of thestate in which he was, and to direct you to give me all that he has,without retaining anything, since otherwise they would slay him withoutmercy.  As time passed, he wished that I should take his seven-leagueboots, as you see, in order to make haste, and also that you might notthink me an impostor."The good woman, very much frightened, gave him all she had; for thisOgre was a good husband, although he did eat little children.Hop-o'-My-Thumb, being then loaded with all the Ogre's treasures,returned to his father's house, where he was welcomed with great joyand where they all lived happily ever after.THE GOOSE-GIRLAnonymousTHERE was once upon a time an old Queen whose husband had been dead formany years, and she had a beautiful daughter.  When the princess grewup she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance.  Whenthe time came for her to be married, and she had to ,journey forth intothe distant kingdom, the aged Queen packed up for her many costlyvessels of silver and gold, and trinkets also of gold and silver; andcups and jewels, in short, everything which appertained to a royaldowry, for she loved her child with all her heart.  She likewise senther maid in waiting, who was to ride with her, and hand her over to thebridegroom, and each had a horse for the journey, but the horse of theKing's daughter was called Falada, and could speak.  So when the hourof parting had come, the aged mother went into her bedroom, took asmall knife and cut her finger with it until it bled, then she held awhite handkerchief to it into which she left three drops of blood fall,gave it to her daughter and said: "Dear child, preserve this carefully,it will be of service to you on your way."So they took a sorrowful leave of each other: the princess put thepiece of cloth in her bosom, mounted her horse, and then went away toher bridegroom.  After she had ridden for a while she felt a burningthirst and said to her waiting-maid: "Dismount, and take my cup whichthou hast brought with thee for me, and get me some water from thestream, for I should like to drink."  "If you are thirsty," said thewaiting-maid, "get off your horse yourself, and lie down and drink outof the water; I don't choose to be your servant."  So in her greatthirst the princess alighted, bent down over the water in the streamand drank, and was not allowed to drink out of the golden cup.  Thenshe said, "Ah, Heaven!" and the three drops of blood answered:"If thy mother knew this, her heart would break."But the King's daughter was humble, said nothing, and mounted her horseagain.  She rode some miles further, but the day was warm, the sunscorched her, and she was thirsty once more, and when they came to astream of water, she again cried to her waiting-maid: "Dismount, andgive me some water in my golden cup," for she had long ago forgottenthe girl's ill words.  But the waiting-maid said still more haughtily:"If you wish to drink, drink as you can, I don't choose to be yourmaid."  Then in her great thirst the King's daughter alighted, bentover the flowing stream, wept and said: "Ah, heaven!" and the drops ofblood again replied: "If thy mother knew this, her heart would break."And as she was thus drinking and leaning right over the stream, thehandkerchief with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom, andfloated away with the water without her observing it, so great was hertrouble.The waiting-maid, however, had seen it, and she rejoiced to think thatshe had now power over the bride, for since the princess had lost thedrops of blood, she had become weak and powerless.  So now when shewanted to mount her horse again, the one that was called Falada, thewaiting-maid said: "Falada is more suitable for me, and my nag will dofor thee," and the princess had to be content with that.  Then thewaiting-maid, with many hard words, bade the princess exchange herroyal apparel for her own shabby clothes; and at length she wascompelled to swear by the clear sky above her, that she would not sayone word of this to any one at the royal court, and if she had nottaken this oath she would have been killed on the spot.  But Falada sawall this, and observed it well.The waiting-maid now mounted Falada, and the true bride the bad horse,and thus they traveled onward, until at length they entered the royalpalace.  There were great rejoicings over her arrival, and the princesprang forward to meet her, lifted the waiting-maid from her horse, andthought she was his consort.  She was conducted upstairs, but the realprincess was left standing below.  Then the old King looked out of thewindow and saw her standing in the courtyard, and how dainty anddelicate and beautiful she was, and instantly went to the royalapartment, and asked the bride about the girl she had with her who wasstanding down below in the courtyard, and who she was.  "I picked herup on my way for a companion; give the girl something to work at, thatshe may not stand idle."  But the old King had no work for her, andknew of none, so he said: "I have a little boy who tends the geese, shemay help him."  The boy was called Conrad, and the true bride had tohelp him to tend the geese.Soon afterward the false bride said to the young King: "Dearesthusband, I beg you to do me a favor."  He answered: "I will do so mostwillingly."  "Then send for the knacker, and have the head of the horseon which I rode here cut off, for it vexed me on the way."  In realityshe was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to theKing's daughter.  Then she succeeded in making the King promise that itshould be done, and the faithful Falada was to die; this came to theears of the real princess, and she secretly promised to pay the knackera piece of gold if he would perform a small service for her.  There wasa great dark-looking gateway in the town, through which morning andevening she had to pass with the geese: would he be so good as to nailup Falada's head on it, so that she might see him again, more thanonce.  The knacker's man promised to do that, and cut off the head, andnailed it fast beneath the dark gateway.Early in the morning, when she and Conrad drove out their flock beneaththis gateway, she said in passing:"Alas, Falada, hanging thereThen the head answered:"Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!If this your tender mother knew,Her heart would surely break in two."Then they went still further out of the town, and drove their geeseinto the country.  And when they had come to the meadow, she sat downand unbound her hair which was like pure gold, and Conrad saw it anddelighted in its brightness, and wanted to pluck out a few hairs.  Thenshe said:"Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,Blow Conrad's little hat away,And make him chase it here and there,Until I have braided all my hair,And bound it up again.And there came such a violent wind that it blew Conrad's hat far awayacross country, and he was forced to run after it.  When he came backshe had finished combing her hair and was putting it up again, and hecould not get any of it.  Then Conrad was angry, and would not speak toher, and thus they watered the geese until the evening, and then theywent home.Next day when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway,the maiden said:"Alas, Falada, hanging thereFalada answered:"Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!If this your tender mother knew,Her heart would surely break in two."And she sat down again in the field and began to comb out her hair, andConrad ran and tried to clutch it, so she said in haste:"Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,Blow Conrad's little hat away,And make him chase it here and there,Until I have braided all my hair,And bound it up again.Then the wind blew, and blew his little hat off his head and far away,and Conrad was forced to run after it, and when he came back, her hairhad been put up a long time, and he could get none of it, and so theylooked after their geese till evening came.But in the evening after they had got home, Conrad went to the oldKing, and said: "I won't tend the geese with that girl any longer!""Why not?" inquired the aged King.  "Oh, because she vexes me the wholeday long."  Then the aged King commanded him to relate what it was thatshe did to him.  And Conrad said: "In the morning when we pass beneaththe dark gateway with the flock, there is a sorry horse's head on thewall and she says to it:"Alas, Falada, hanging there!"And the head replies:"Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!If this your tender mother knew,Her heart would surely break in two."And Conrad went on to relate what happened on the goose pasture, andhow when there he had to chase his hat.The aged King commanded him to drive his flock out again next day, andas soon as morning came, he placed himself behind the dark gateway, andheard how the maiden spoke to the head of Falada, and then he too wentinto the country, and hid himself in the thicket in the meadow.  Therehe soon saw with his own eyes the goose-girl and the goose-boy bringingtheir flock, and how after a while she sat down and unplaited her hair,which shone with radiance.  And soon she said:"Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,Blow Conrad's little hat away,And make him chase it here and there,Until I have braided all my hair,And bound it up again."Then came a blast of wind and carried off Conrad's hat, so that he hadto run far away, while the maiden quietly went on combing and plaitingher hair, all of which the King observed.  Then, quite unseen, he wentaway, and when the goose-girl came home in the evening, he called heraside, and asked why she did all these things.  "I may not tell youthat, and I dare not lament my sorrows to any human being, for I havesworn not to do so by the heaven which is above me; if I had not donethat, I should have lost my life."  He urged her and left her no peace,but he could draw nothing from her.  Then said he: "If thou wilt nottell me anything, tell thy sorrows to the iron stove there," and hewent away.  Then she crept into the iron stove, and began to weep andlament, and emptied her whole heart, and said: "Here am I deserted bythe whole world, and yet I am a King's daughter, and a false waiting-maid has by force brought me to such a pass that I have been compelledto put off my royal apparel, and she has taken my place with mybridegroom, and I have to perform menial service as a goose-girl.  Ifmy mother did but know that, her heart would break."The aged King, however, was standing outside by the pipe of the stove,and was listening to what she said and heard it.  Then he came backagain, and bade her come out of the stove.  And royal garments wereplaced on her, and it was marvellous how beautiful she was!  The agedKing summoned his son, and revealed to him that he had got the falsebride who was only a waiting-maid, but that the true one was standingthere, as the sometime goose-girl.  The young King rejoiced with allhis heart when he saw her beauty and youth, and a great feast was madeready to which all the people and all good friends were invited.  Atthe head of the table sat the bridegroom with the King's daughter atone side of him and the waiting-maid on the other, but the waiting-maidwas blinded, and did not recognize the princess in her dazzling array.When they had eaten and drunk, and were merry, the aged King asked thewaiting-maid as a riddle, what a person deserved who had behaved insuch and such a way to her master, and at the same time related thewhole story, and asked what sentence such an one merited?  Then thefalse bride said: "She deserves no better fate than to be strippedentirely naked, and put in a barrel which is studded inside withpointed nails, and two white horses should be harnessed to it, whichwill drag her along through one street after another, till she isdead."  "It is thou," said the aged King, "and thou must pronouncethine own sentence, and thus shall it be done unto thee."  And when thesentence had been carried out, the young King married his true bride,and both of them reigned over their kingdom in peace and happiness.HE WHO KNEW NOT FEARAnonymousA CERTAIN father had two sons, the elder of whom was sharp andsensible, and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and couldneither learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him theysaid: "There's a fellow who will give his father some trouble!"  Whenanything had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to doit; but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or inthe night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any otherdismal place, he answered: "Oh, no, father, I'll not go there, it makesme shudder!" for he was afraid.  Or when stories were told by the fireat night which made the flesh creep, the listeners often said: "Oh, itmakes us shudder!" the younger sat in a corner and listened with therest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean.  "They arealways saying: 'It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!' It does notmake me shudder," thought he.  "That, too, must be an art of which Iunderstand nothing!"Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: "Hearken tome, thou fellow in the corner there, thou art growing tall and strong,and thou, too, must learn something by which thou canst earn thyliving.  Look how thy brother works, but thou dost not even earn thysalt."  "Well, father," he replied, "I am quite willing to learnsomething-indeed, if it could but be managed, I should like to learnhow to shudder.  I don't understand that at all yet."  The elderbrother smiled when he heard that, and thought to himself:"Good God, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!  He will never begood for anything as long as he lives!  He who wants to be a sicklemust bend himself betimes."The father sighed, and answered him: "Thou shalt soon learn what it isto suffer, but thou wilt not earn thy living by that."Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the fatherbewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backwardin every respect that he knew nothing and learned nothing.  "Justthink," said he, "when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread,he actually wanted to learn to shudder."  "If that be all," replied thesexton, "he can learn that with me.  Send him to me, and I will soonpolish him."  The father was glad to do it, for he thought: "It willtrain the boy a little."  The sexton, therefore, took him into hishouse, and he had to ring the bell.  After a day or two the sextonawoke him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the churchtower and ring the bell.  "Thou shalt soon learn what shuddering is,"thought he, and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was atthe top of the tower and turned around, and was just going to take holdof the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs oppositeto the sounding hole.  "Who is there?" cried he, but the figure made noreply, and did not move or stir.  "Give an answer," cried the boy, "ortake thyself off; thou hast no business here at night."The sexton, however, remained standing motionless, that the boy mightthink he was a ghost.  The boy cried a second time: "What dost thouwant here?-speak if thou art an honest fellow, or I will throw theedown the steps!"  The sexton thought, "He can't intend to be as bad ashis words," uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone.Then the boy called to him for the third time, and as that was also tono purpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, sothat it fell down ten steps and remained lying there in a corner.Thereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word wentto bed and fell asleep.  The sexton's wife waited a long time for herhusband, but he did not come back.  At length she became uneasy, andwakened the boy, and asked, "Dost thou not know where my husband is?He went up the tower before thou didst."  "No, I don't know," repliedthe boy, "but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the otherside of the steps, and as he would neither give an answer nor go away,I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him down stairs; just go thereand you will see if it was he, I should be sorry if it were."  Thewoman ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in thecorner, and had broken his leg.She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to theboy's father.  "Your boy," cried she, "has been the cause of a greatmisfortune!  He has thrown my husband down the steps and made him breakhis leg.  Take the good-for-nothing fellow away from our house."  Thefather was terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy.  "Whatwicked tricks are these?" said he; "the devil must have put this intothy head."  "Father," he replied, "do listen to me.  I am quiteinnocent.  He was standing there by night like one who is intending todo some evil.  I did not know who it was, and I entreated him threetimes either to speak or to go away."  "Ah," said the father, "I havenothing but unhappiness with thee.  Go out of my sight.  I will seethee no more.""Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day.  Then will Igo forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,understand one art which will support me."  "Learn what thou wilt,"spake the father, "it is all the same to me.  Here are fifty thalersfor thee.  Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one fromwhence thou comest, and who is thy father, for I have reason to beashamed of thee."  "Yes, father, it small be as you will.  If youdesire nothing more than that, I can easily keep it in mind."When day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty thalers into hispocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said tohimself, "If I could but shudder!  If I could but shudder!"Then a man approached who heard this conversation which the youth washolding with himself, and when they had walked a little further towhere they could see the gallows, the man said to him, "Look, there isthe tree where seven men have married the ropemaker's daughter, and arenow learning how to fly.  Sit down below it, and wait till night comes,and thou wilt soon learn how to shudder."  "If that is all that iswanted," answered the youth, "it is easily done; but if I learn how toshudder as quickly as that, thou shalt have my fifty thalers.  Justcome back to me early in the morning."  Then the youth went to thegallows, sat down below it, and waited till evening came.  And as hewas cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the wind blew sosharp that in spite of his fire he could not get warm.  And as the windknocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved backward andforward, he thought to himself: "Thou shiverest below by the fire, buthow those up above must freeze and suffer!"  And as he felt pity forthem, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them afterthe other, and brought down all seven.  Then he stirred the fire, blewit, and set them all round it to warm themselves.  But they sat thereand did not stir, and the fire caught their clothes.  So he said:"Take care, or I will hang you up again."  The dead men, however, didnot hear, but were quite silent, and let their rags go on burning.  Onthis he grew angry, and said: "If you will not take care, I cannot helpyou, I will not be burned with you, and he hung them up again each inhis turn.Then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep, and next morning the mancame to him and wanted to have the fifty thalers, and said: "Well, dostthou know how to shudder?"  "No," answered he, "how was I to get toknow?  Those fellows up there did not open their mouths, and were sostupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodiesget burned."  Then the man saw that he would not carry away the fiftythalers that day, and went away saying:"One of this kind has never come in my way before."The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter tohimself: "Ah, if I could but shudder!  Ah, if I could but shudder!"  Awagoner who was striding behind him heard that and asked: "Who artthou?"  "I don't know," answered the youth.  Then the wagoner asked:"From whence comest thou?"  "I know not."  "Who is thy father?"  "ThatI may not tell thee."  "What is it that thou art always mutteringbetween thy teeth?"  "Ah," replied the youth, "I do so wish I couldshudder, but no one can teach me how to do it."  "Give up thy foolishchatter," said the wagoner.  "Come go with me, I will see about a placefor thee."  The youth went with the wagoner, and in the evening theyarrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night.  Then at theentrance of the room the youth again said quite loudly, "If I could butshudder!  If I could but shudder!"  The host who heard that, laughedand said: "If that is your desire, there ought to be a good opportunityfor you here."  "Ah, be silent," said the hostess; "so many inquisitivepersons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and a shameif such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again."But the youth said: "However difficult it may be, I will learn it, andfor this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth."  He let the host haveno rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood ahaunted castle where any one could very easily learn what shudderingwas, if he would but watch in it for three nights.  The King hadpromised that he who would venture this should have his daughter towife, and she was the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on.  Greattreasures likewise lay in the castle, which were guarded by evilspirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and would make a poorman rich enough.  Already many men had gone into the castle, but as yetnone had come out again.  Then the youth went next morning to the King,and said that if he were allowed he would watch three nights in theenchanted castle.  The King looked at him, and as the youth pleasedhim, he said: "Thou mayst ask for three things to take into the castlewith thee, but they must be things without life."  Then he answered,"Then I ask for a fire, a turning-lathe, and a cutting-board with theknife."  The King had these things carried into the castle for himduring the day.  When night was drawing near, the youth went up andmade himself a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe."Ah, if I could but shudder!" said he, "but I shall not learn it hereeither."  Toward midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he wasblowing it, something cried suddenly from one cornier, "Au, miau!  howcold we are!"  "You simpletons!" cried he, "what are you crying about?If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves."And when he had said that, two great black cats came with onetremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked savagelyat him with their fiery eyes.  After a short time, when they had warmedthemselves, they said: "Comrade, shall we have a game at cards?"  "Whynot?" he replied, "but just show me your paws.  Then they stretched outtheir claws.  "Oh," said he, "what long nails you have!  Wait, I mustfirst cut them a little for you."  Thereupon he seized them by thethroats, put them on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast.  "Ihave looked at your fingers," said he, "and my fancy for card-playinghas gone, and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water.But when he had made away with these two, and was about to sit downagain by his fire, out from every hole and corner came black cats andblack dogs with red-hot chains, and more and more of them came until hecould no longer stir, and they yelled horribly, and got on his fire,pulled it to pieces, and wanted to put it out.  He watched them for awhile quietly, but at last when they were going too far, he seized hiscutting knife, and cried: "Away with ye, vermin," and began to cut themdown.  Part of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out intothe fish pond.  When he came back he blew up the embers of his fireagain and warmed himself.  And as he thus sat, his eyes would keep openno longer, and he felt a desire to sleep.  Then he looked round and sawa great bed in the corner.  "That is the very thing for me," said he,and got into it.  When he was just going to shut his eyes, however, thebed began to move of its own accord, and went over the whole of thecastle.  'That's right," said he, "but go faster."  Then the bed rolledon as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over thresholdsand steps, but suddenly, hop, hop, it turned over upside down, and layon him like a mountain.  But he threw quilts and pillows up in the air,got out and said: "Now any one who likes may drive," and lay down byhis fire, and slept until it was day.  In the morning the King came,and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the spiritshad killed him and he was dead.  Then said he: "After all it is a pity-he is a handsome man."  The youth heard it, got up, and said: "It hasnot come to that yet."  Then the King was astonished, but very glad,and asked how he had fared.  "Very well indeed," answered he; "onenight is over, the two others will get over likewise."  Then he went tothe innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: "I neverexpected to see thee alive again!  Hast thou learned how to shudderyet?"  "No," said he, "it is all in vain.  If some one would but tellme!"The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by thefire, and once more began his old song: "If I could but shudder!"  Whenmidnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; atfirst it was low, but it grew louder and louder.  Then it was quiet fora while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down thechimney and fell before him.  "Hollo!" cried he, "another half belongsto this.  This is too little!"  Then the uproar began again, there wasa roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise.  "Wait,"said he, "I will just blow up the fire a little for thee."  When he haddone that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together,and a frightful man was sitting in his place.  "That is no part of ourbargain," said the youth, "the bench is mine."  The man wanted to pushhim away; the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him offwith all his strength, and seated himself again, in his own place.Then still more men fell down, one after the other; they brought ninedead men's legs and two skulls, and set them up and played at ninepinswith them.  The youth also wanted to play and said: "Hark you, can Ijoin you?"  "Yes, if thou hast any money."  "Money enough," replied he,"but your balls are not quite round."  Then he took the skulls and putthem in the lathe and turned them till they were round.  "There, now,they will roll better!" said he.  "Hurrah!  now it goes merrily!"  Heplayed with them and lost some of his money, but when it struck twelve,everything vanished from his sight.  He lay down and quietly fellasleep.  Next morning the King came to inquire after him.  "How has itfared with thee this time?" asked he.  "I have been playing atninepins," he answered, "and have lost a couple of farthings."  "Hastthou not shuddered then?"  "Eh, what?" said he, "I have made merry.  IfI did but know what it was to shudder!"The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:"If I could but shudder."  When it grew late, six tall men came in andbrought a coffin.  Then said he: "Ha, ha, that is certainly my littlecousin, who only died a few days ago," and he beckoned with his finger,and cried: "Come, little cousin, come."  They placed the coffin on theground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man laytherein.  He felt his face, but it was cold as ice.  "Stop," said he,"I will warm thee a, little," and went to the fire and warmed his handand laid it on the dead man's face, but he remained cold.  Then he tookhim out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbedhis arms that the blood might circulate again.  As this also did nogood, he thought to himself: "When two people lie in bed together, theywarm each other," and carried him to bed, covered him over and lay downby him.  After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began tomove.  Then said the youth: "See, little cousin, have I not warmedthee?" The dead man, however, got up and cried, "Now will I stranglethee.""What!" said he, "is that the way thou thankest me?  Thou shalt at oncego into thy coffin again," and he took him up, threw him into it, andshut the lid.Then came the six men and carried him away again.  "I cannot manage toshudder," said he.  "I shall never learn it here as long as I live."Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.He was old, however, and had a long white beard.  "Thou wretch," criedhe, "thou shalt soon learn what it is to shudder, for thou shalt die.""Not so fast," replied the youth, "If I am to die, I shall have to havea say in it."  "I will soon seize thee," said the fiend.  "Softly,softly, do not talk so big.  I am as strong as thou art, and perhapseven stronger."  "We shall see," said the old man.  "If thou artstronger, I will let thee go-come, we will try."  Then he led him bydark passages to a smith's forge, took an ax, and with one blow struckan anvil into the ground.  "I can do that better still," said theyouth, and went to the other anvil.  The old man placed himself nearand wanted to look on, and his white heard hung down.  Then the youthseized the ax, split the anvil with one blow, and struck the old man'sbeard in with it.  "Now I have thee," said the youth.  "Now it is thouwho wilt have to die."  Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old mantill he moaned and entreated him to stop, and he would give him greatriches.  The youth drew out the ax and let him go.  The old man led himback into the castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full ofgold.  "Of these," said he, "one part is for the poor, the other is forthe king, the third is thine."  In the meantime it struck twelve, andthe spirit disappeared; the youth, therefore, was left in darkness.  "Ishall still be able to find my way out," said he, and felt about, foundthe way into the room, and slept there by his fire.  Next morning theKing came and said, "Now thou must have learned what shuddering is?""No," he answered; "what can it be?  My dead cousin was here, and abearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below, but noone told me what it was to shudder."  "Then," said the King, "thou hastdelivered the castle, and shalt marry my daughter."  "That is all verywell," said he, "but still I do not know what it is to shudder!"Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoevermuch the young King loved his wife, and however happy he was, he stillsaid always: "If I could but shudder-if I could but shudder."  And atlast she was angry at this.  Her waiting-maid said, "I will find a curefor him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder."  She went out tothe stream which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketfulof gudgeons brought to her.  At night when the young King was sleeping,his wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucketful ofcold water with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fisheswould sprawl about him.  When this was done, he woke up and cried: "Oh,what makes me shudder so?-what makes me shudder so, dear wife?  Ah! nowI know what it is to shudder!"AESOP'S FABLESThis has come to be the commonly accepted name for the well-knowncollection of stories about animals, though we cannot be sure that anyof them, were written by the Greek slave of that name, who, Herodotustells us, lived about the year 55O B.C.  The fable about animals isprobably the oldest form of story known.  Its object is to teach alesson to men and women, without seeming to do so, and because of thisconcealed lesson it has always been a great favorite with all nations.In Russia, for example, where a man did not dare say what he thoughtabout a Government officer, he could tell a fable about the Dog in theManger.THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSENOW you must know that a Town Mouse once upon a time went on a visit tohis cousin in the country.  He was rough and ready, this cousin, but heloved his town friend and made him heartily welcome.  Beans and bacon,cheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely.The Town Mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare, andsaid: "I cannot understand, Cousin, how you can put up with such poorfood as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in thecountry; come you with me and I will show you how to live.  When youhave been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stooda country life."  No sooner said than done: the two mice set off forthe town and arrived at the Town Mouse's residence late at night.  "Youwill want some refreshment after our long journey," said the politeTown Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining-room.  There theyfound the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating upjellies and cakes and all that was nice.  Suddenly they heard growlingand barking.  "What is that?" said the Country Mouse.  "It is only thedogs of the house," answered the other.  "Only!" said the CountryMouse.  "I do not like that music at my dinner."  Just at that momentthe door flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had toscamper down and run off.  "Good-by, Cousin," said the Country Mouse."What!  going so soon?" said .the other.  "Yes," he replied;"BETTER BEANS AND BACON IN PEACETHAN CAKES AND ALE IN FEAR."THE MAN, THE BOY, AND DONKEYA MAN and his son were once going with their Donkey to market.  As theywere walking along by its side a countryman passed them and said: "Youfools, what is a Donkey for but to ride upon?"So the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way.  Butsoon they passed a group of men, one of whom said: "See that lazyyoungster, he lets his father walk while he rides."So the Man ordered his Boy to get off, and got on himself.  But theyhadn't gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said to theother: "Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudgealong."Well, the Man didn't know what to do, but at last he took his Boy upbefore him on the Donkey.  By this time they had come to the town, andthe passers-by began to jeer and point to them.  The Man stopped andasked what they were scoffing at.  The men said: "Aren't you ashamed ofyourself for overloading that poor Donkey of yours-you and your hulkingson?"The Man and Boy got off and tried to think what to do.  They thoughtand they thought, till at last they cut down a pole, tied the Donkey'sfeet to it, and raised the pole and the Donkey to their shoulders.They went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came toMarket Bridge, when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kickedout and caused the Boy to drop his end of the pole.  In the strugglethe Donkey fell over the bridge, and his fore-feet being tied togetherhe was drowned."That will teach you," said an old man who had followed them:"PLEASE ALL, AND YOU WILL PLEASENONE."THE SHEPHERD'S BOYTHERE was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot ofa mountainnear a dark forest.  It was rather lonely for him all day, so hethought upon a plan by which he could get a little company and someexcitement.  He rushed down toward the village calling out "Wolf,'Wolf," and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of themstopped with him for a considerable time.This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterward he tried thesame trick, and again the villagers came to his help.But shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out from the forest,and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out "Wolf,Wolf," still louder than before.  But this time the villagers who hadbeen fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, andnobody stirred to come to bis help.So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy's flock, and when the boycomplained, the wise man of the village said:"A LIAR WILL NOT BE BELIEVED, EVENWHEN HE SPEAKS THE TRUTH."ANDROCLESA SLAVE named Androcles once escaped from his master and fled to theforest.  As he was wandering about there he came upon a Lion lying downmoaning and groaning.At first he turned to flee, but finding that the Lion did not pursuehim, he turned back and went up to him.As he came near, the Lion put out his paw, which was all swollen andbleeding, and Androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it, andwas causing all the pain.  He pulled out the thorn and bound up the pawof the Lion, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcleslike a dog.Then the Lion took Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bringhim meat from which to live.But shortly afterward both Androcles and the Lion were captured, andthe slave was sentenced to be thrown to the Lion, after the latter hadbeen kept without food for several days.  The Emperor and all his Courtcame to see the spectacle and Androcles was led out into the middle ofthe arena.  Soon the Lion was let loose from his den, and rushedbounding and roaring toward his victim.  But as soon as he came near toAndrocles he recognized his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked hishands like a friendly dog.  The Emperor, surprised at this, summonedAndrocles to him, who told him the whole story.  Whereupon the slavewas pardoned and freed, and the Lion let loose to his native forest."GRATITUDE IS THE SIGN OF NOBLE SOULS."THE FOX AND THE STORKAT one time the Fox and the Stork were on visiting terms and seemedvery good friends.  So the Fox invited the Stork to dinner, and for ajoke put nothing before her but some soup in a very shallow dish.  Thisthe Fox could easily lap up, but the Stork could only wet the end ofher long bill in it, and left the meal as hungry as when she began."I am sorry," said the Fox, "the soup is not to your liking.""Pray do not apologize," said the Stork.  "I hope you will return thisvisit, and come and dine with me soon."So a day was appointed when the Fox should visit the Stork; but whenthey were seated at table all that was for their dinner was containedin a very long-necked jar with a narrow mouth, in which the Fox couldnot insert his snout, so all he could manage to do was to lick theoutside of the jar."I will not apologize for the dinner," said the Stork:"ONE BAD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER."THE CROW AND THE PITCHERA CROW, half-dead with thirst, came upon a Pitcher which had once beenfull of water; but when the Crow put its beak into the mouth of thePitcher he found that only very little water was left in it, and thathe could not reach far enough down to get at it.He tried, and he tried, but at last had to give up in despair.Then a thought came to him, and he took a pebble and dropped it intothe Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped it into thePitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into thePitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into thePitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into thePitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into thePitcher.At last, at last, he saw the water mount up near him; and after castingin a few more pebbles he was able to quench his thirst and save hislife."LITTLE BY LITTLE DOES THE TRICK."THE FROGS DESIRING A KINGTHE Frogs were living as happy as could be in a marshy swamp that justsuited them; they went splashing about caring for nobody and nobodytroubling with them.  But some of them thought that this was not right,that they should have a King and a proper constitution, so theydetermined to send up a petition to Jove to give them what they wanted."Mighty Jove," they cried, "send unto us a King that will rule over usand keep us in order."  Jove laughed at their croaking, and threw downinto the swamp a huge Log, which came down-kerplash-into the swamp.The Frogs were frightened out of their lives by the commotion made intheir midst, and all rushed to the bank to look at the horriblemonster; but after a time, seeing that it did not move, one or two ofthe boldest of them ventured out toward the Log, and even dared totouch it; still it did not move.  Then the greatest hero of the Frogsjumped upon the Log and commenced dancing up and down upon it,thereupon all the Frogs came and did the same; and for sometime theFrogs went about their business every day without taking the slightestnotice of the new King Log lying in their midst.But this did not suit them, so they sent another petition to Jove, andsaid to him: "We want a real King; one that will really rule over us."Now this made Jove angry, so he sent among them a big Stork that soonset to work gobbling them all up.  Then the Frogs repented when toolate."BETTER NO RULE THAN CRUEL RULE."THE FROG AND THE OX"OH, FATHER," said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the side ofa pool, "I have seen such a terrible monster!  It was as big as amountain, with horns on its head, and a long tail, and it had hoofsdivided in two.""Tush, child, tush," said the old Frog, "that was only Farmer White'sOx.  It isn't so big either; he may be a little bit taller than I, butI could easily make myself quite as broad; just you see." So he blewhimself out, and blew himself out, and blew himself out.  "Was he asbig as that?" asked he."Oh, much bigger than that," said the young Frog.Again the old one blew himself out, and asked the young one if the Oxwas as big as that."Bigger, father, bigger," was the reply.So the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew and blew, and swelledand swelled and swelled.  And then he said: "I'm sure the Ox is not asbig as ______"  But at this moment he burst."SELF-CONCEIT MAY LEAD TO SELF-DESTRUCTION."THE COCK AND THE PEARLA COCK was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens whensuddenly he espied something shining and the straw.  "Ho! ho!" quothhe, "that's for me," and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw.What did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had beenlost in the yard?  "You may be a treasure," quoth Master Cock, "to menthat prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley cornthan a peck of pearls.""PRECIOUS THINGS ARE FOR THOSE THAT CAN PRIZE THEM."THE FOX WITHOUT A TAILIT happened that a Fox caught its tail in a trap, and in struggling torelease himself lost all of it but the stump.  At first he was ashamedto show himself among his fellow foxes.  But at last he determined toput a bolder face upon his misfortune, and summoned all the foxes to ageneral meeting to consider a proposal which he had to place beforethem.When they had assembled together the Fox proposed that they should alldo away with their tails.  He pointed out how inconvenient a tail waswhen they were pursued by their enemies, the dogs; how much it was inthe way when they desired to sit down and hold a friendly conversationwith one another.  He failed to see any advantage in carrying aboutsuch a useless encumbrance."That is all very well," said one of the older foxes; "but I do notthink you would have recommended us to dispense with our chief ornamentif you had not happened to lose it yourself.""DISTRUST INTERESTED ADVICE."THE FOX AND THE CATA FOX was boasting to a Cat of its clever devices for escaping itsenemies.  "I have a whole bag of tricks," he said, "which contains ahundred ways of escaping my enemies.""I have only one," said the Cat; "but I can generally manage withthat."  Just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of houndscoming toward them, and the Cat immediately scampered up a tree and hidherself in the boughs.  "This is my plan," said the Cat.  "What are yougoing to do?"  The Fox thought first of one way, then of another, andwhile he was debating the hounds came nearer and nearer, and at lastthe Fox in his confusion was caught up by the hounds and soon killed bythe huntsmen.  Miss Puss, who had been looking on, said:"BETTER ONE SAFE WAY THAN A HUNDREDON WHICH YOU CANNOTRECKON."THE DOG IN THE MANGERA DOG looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the Manger of an Oxand lay there cosily upon the straw.  But soon the Ox, returning fromits afternoon work, came up to the Manger and wanted to eat some of thestraw.  The Dog in a rage, being awakened from its slumber, stood upand barked at the Ox, and whenever it came near attempted to bite it.At last the Ox had to give up the hope of getting at the straw, andwent away muttering:"AH, PEOPLE OFTEN GRUDGE OTHERSWHAT THEY CANNOT ENJOYTHEMSELVES."THE FOX AND THE GOATBy an unlucky chance a Fox fell into a deep well from which he couldnot get out.  A Goat passed by shortly afterward, and asked the Foxwhat he was doing down there.  "Oh, have you not heard?" said the Fox;"there is going to be a great drought, so I jumped down here in orderto be sure to have water by me.  Why don't you come down, too?"  TheGoat thought well of this advice, and jumped down into the well.  Butthe Fox immediately jumped on her back, and by putting his foot on herlong horns managed to jump up to the edge of the well.  "Good-by,friend," said the Fox ;-"remember next time,"NEVER TRUST THE ADVICE OF A MANIN DIFFICULTIES."BELLING THE CATLONG ago, the mice held a general council to consider what measuresthey could take to outwit their common enemy, the Cat.  Some said this,and some said that; but at last a young mouse got up and said he had aproposal to make, which he thought would meet the case.  "You will allagree," said he, "that our chief danger consists in the sly andtreacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us.  Now, if we couldreceive some signal of her approach, we could easily escape from her.I venture, therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, andattached by a ribbon round the neck of the Cat.  By this means weshould always know when she was about, and could easily retire whileshe was in the neighborhood."This proposed met with general applause, until an old mouse got up andsaid: "That is all very well, but who is to bell the Cat?"  The micelooked at one another and nobody spoke.  Then the old mouse said:"IT IS EASY TO PROPOSE IMPOSSIBLEREMEDIES."THE JAY AND THE PEACOCKA JAY venturing into a yard where Peacocks used to walk, found there anumber of feathers which had fallen from the Peacocks when they weremoulting.  He tied them all to his tail and strutted down toward thePeacocks.  When he came near them they soon discovered the cheat, andstriding up to him pecked at him and plucked away his borrowed plumes.So the Jay could do no better than go back to the other Jays, who hadwatched his behavior from a distance; but they were equally annoyedwith him, and told him"IT IS NOT ONLY FINE FEATHERS THATMAKE FINE BIRDS."THE ASS AND THE LAP-DOGA FARMER one day came to the stables to see to his beasts of burden:among them was his favorite Ass, that was always well fed and oftencarried his master.  With the Farmer came his Lap-dog, who danced aboutand licked his hand and frisked about as happy as could be.  The Farmerfelt in his pocket, gave the Lap-dog some dainty food, and sat downwhile he gave his orders to his servants.  The Lap-dog jumped into hismaster's lap, and lay there blinking while the Farmer stroked his ears.The Ass, seeing this, broke loose from his halter and commencedprancing about in imitation of the Lap-dog.  The Farmer could not holdhis sides with laughter, so the Ass went up to him, and putting hisfeet upon the Farmer's shoulder attempted to climb into his lap.  TheFarmer's servants rushed up with sticks and pitchforks and soon taughtthe Ass that"CLUMSY JESTING IS NO JOKE."THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPERIN a field one summer's day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirpingand singing to its heart's content.  An Ant passed by, bearing alongwith great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest."Why not come and chat with me," said the Grasshopper, "instead oftoiling and moiling in that way?""I am helping to lay up food for the winter," said the Ant, "andrecommend you to do the same.""Why bother about winter?"  said the Grasshopper; "we have got plentyof food at present."But the Ant went on its way and continued its toil.Then the winter came the Grasshopper had no food, and found itselfdying of hunger, while it saw the ants distributing every day corn andgrain from the stores they had collected in the summer.  Then theGrasshopper knewIT IS BEST TO PREPARE FOR THE DAYSOF NECESSITY.THE WOODMAN AND THE SERPENTONE wintry day a Woodman was tramping home from his work when he sawsomething black lying on the snow.  When he came closer, he saw it wasa Serpent to all appearance dead.  But he took it up and put it in hisbosom to warm while he hurried home.  As soon as he got indoors he putthe Serpent down on the hearth before the fire.  The children watchedit and saw it slowly come to life again.  Then one of them stooped downto stroke it, but the Serpent raised its head and put out its fangs andwas about to sting the child to death.  So the Woodman seized his axe,and with one stroke cut the Serpent in two.  "Ah," said he,"NO GRATITUDE FROM THE WICKED."THE MILKMAID AND HER PAILPATTY, the Milkmaid, was going to market carrying her milk in a Pail onher head.  As she went along she began calculating what she would dowith the money she would get for the milk.  "I'll buy some fowls fromFarmer Brown," said she, "and they will lay eggs each morning, which Iwill sell to the parson's wife.  With the money that I get from thesale of these eggs I'll buy myself a new dimity frock and a chip hat;and when I go to market, won't all the young men come up and speak tome!  Polly Shaw will be that jealous; but I don't care.  I shall justlook at her and toss my head like this."  As she spoke, she tossed herhead back, the Pail fell off it and all the milk was spilt.  So she hadto go home and tell her mother what had occurred."Ah, my child," said her mother,DO NOT COUNT YOUR CHICKENS BEFORETHEY ARE HATCHED.THE LION AND THE MOUSEONCE when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and downupon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him,and opened his big jaws to swallow him.  "Pardon, O King," cried thelittle Mouse; "forgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knowsbut what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?"  The Lionwas so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that helifted up his paw and let him go.  Some time after the Lion was caughtin a trap, and the hunters, who desired to carry him alive to the King,tied him to a tree while they went in search of a wagon to carry himon.  Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sadplight in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away theropes that bound the King of the Beasts.  "Was I not right?" said thelittle Mouse."LITTLE FRIENDS MAY PROVE GREATFRIENDS."HERCULES AND THE WAGONERA WAGONER was once driving a heavy load along a very muddy way.  Atlast he came to a part of the road where the wheels sank halfway intothe mire, and the more the horses pulled, the deeper sank the wheels.So the Wagoner threw down his whip, and knelt down and prayed toHercules the Strong.  "O Hercules, help me in this my hour ofdistress," quote he.  But Hercules appeared to him, and said:"Tut, man, don't sprawl there.  Get up and put your shoulder to thewheel.""THE GODS HELP THEM THAT HELPTHEMSELVES."THE LION'S SHARETHE Lion went once a-hunting along with the Fox, the Jackal, and theWolf.  They hunted and they hunted till at last they surprised a Stag,and soon took its life.  Then came the question how the spoil should bedivided.  "Quarter me this Stag," roared the Lion; so the other animalsskinned it and cut it into four parts.  Then the Lion took his stand infront of the carcass and pronounced judgment: "The first quarter is forme in my capacity as King of Beasts; the second is mine as arbiter;another share comes to me for my part in the chase; and as far thefourth quarter, well, as for that, I should like to see which of youwill dare to lay a paw upon it.""Humph !" grumbled the Fox as he walked away with his tail between hislegs; but he spoke in a low growl-"YOU MAY SHARE THE LABORS OF THEGREAT, BUT YOU WILL NOT SHARETHE SPOIL."THE FOX AND THE CROWA FOX once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak andsettle on a branch of a tree.  "That's for me, as I am a Fox," saidMaster Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the tree.  "Good-day,Mistress Crow," he cried.  "How well you are looking to-day: how glossyyour feathers; how bright your eye.  I feel sure your voice mustsurpass that of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear butone song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds."  TheCrow lifted up her head and began to caw her best, but the moment sheopened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground, only to besnapped up by Master Fox.  "That will do," said he.  "That was all Iwanted.  In exchange for your cheese I will give you a piece of advicefor the future-"DO NOT TRUST FLATTERERS.THE DOG AND THE SHADOWIT happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it homein his mouth to eat it in peace.  Now on his way home he had to cross aplank lying across a running brook.  As he crossed, he looked down andsaw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath.  Thinking it wasanother dog with another piece of meat, he made up his mind to havethat also.  So he made a snap at the shadow in the water, but as heopened his mouth the piece of meat fell out, dropped into the water andwas never seen more."BEWARE LEST YOU LOSE THE SUBSTANCEBY GRASPING AT THE SHADOW."THE WOLF AND THE LAMBONCE upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside, when,looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to drink alittle lower down.  "There's my supper," thought he, "if only I canfind some excuse to seize it."  Then he called out to the Lamb, "Howdare you muddle the water from which I am drinking?""Nay, master, nay," said Lambikin; "if the water be muddy up there, Icannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to me.""Well, then," said the Wolf, "why did you call me bad names this timelast year?""That cannot be," said the Lamb; "I am only six months old.""I don't care," snarled the Wolf; "if it was not you it was yourfather;" and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb and-WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA-ate her all up.  But before- she died she gasped out-"ANY EXCUSE WILL SERVE A TYRANT."THE BAT, THE BIRDS, AND THE BEASTSA GREAT conflict was about to come off between the Birds and theBeasts.  When the two armies were collected together the Bat hesitatedwhich to join.  The Birds that passed his perch said: "Come with us;"but he said: "I am a Beast."  Later on, some Beasts who were passingunderneath him looked up and said: "Come with us;" but he said: "I am aBird."  Luckily at the last moment peace was made, and no battle tookplace, so the Bat came to the Birds and wished to join in therejoicings, but they all turned against him and he had to fly away.  Hethen went to the Beasts, but soon had to beat a retreat, or else theywould have torn him to pieces.  "Ah," said the Bat, "I see nowHE THAT IS NEITHER ONE THING NORTHE OTHER HAS NO FRIENDS."THE BELLY AND THE MEMBERSONE fine day it occurred to the Members of the Body that they weredoing all the work and the Belly was having all the food.  So they helda meeting, and after a long discussion, decided to strike work till theBelly consented to take its proper share of the work.  So for a day ortwo the Hands refused to take the food, the Mouth refused to receiveit, and the Teeth had no work to do.  But after a day or two theMembers began to find that they themselves were not in a very activecondition: the Hands could hardly move, and the Mouth was all parchedand dry, while the Legs were unable to support the rest.  So thus theyfound that even the Belly in its dull quiet way was doing necessarywork for the Body, and that all must work together or the Body will goto pieces.THE FOX AND THE GRAPESONE hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till hecame to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had beentrained over a lofty branch.  "Just the thing to quench my thirst,"quoth he.  Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and justmissed the bunch.  Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, hejumped up, but with no greater success.  Again and again he tried afterthe tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked awaywith his nose in the air, saying: "I am sure they are sour.""IT IS EASY TO DESPISE WHAT YOUCANNOT GET."THE SWALLOW AND THE OTHER BIRDSIT happened that a Countryman was sowing some hemp seed in a fieldwhere a Swallow and some other birds were hopping about picking uptheir food.  "Beware of that man," quoth the Swallow.  "Why, what is hedoing?" said the others.  "That is hemp seed he is sowing; be carefulto pick up every one of the seeds, or else you will repent it."  Thebirds paid no heed to the Swallow's words, and by and by the hemp grewup and was made into cord, and of the cords nets were made, and many abird that had despised the Swallow's advice was caught in nets made outof that very hemp.  "What did I tell you?" said the Swallow."DESTROY THE SEED OF EVIL, OR ITWILL GROW UP TO YOUR RUIN."This etext was produced by Douglas E. Levy.TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:  "Sunrise" is an elegy to James A.

EMMA LAZARUS. (Written for "The Century Magazine")             Born July 22, 1849; Died November 19, 1887.One hesitates to lift the veil and throw the light upon a life sohidden and a personality so withdrawn as that of Emma Lazarus; butwhile her memory is fresh, and the echo of her songs still lingersin these pages, we feel it a duty to call up her presence once more,and to note the traits that made it remarkable and worthy to shineout clearly before the world.  Of dramatic episode or climax in herlife there is none; outwardly all was placid and serene, like anuntroubled stream whose depths alone hold the strong, quick tide.The story of her life is the story of a mind, of a spirit, everseeking, ever striving, and pressing onward and upward to new truthand light.  Her works are the mirror of this progress.  In reviewingthem, the first point that strikes us is the precocity, or ratherthe spontaneity, of her poetic gift.  She was a born singer; poetrywas her natural language, and to write was less effort than to speak,for she was a shy, sensitive child, with strange reserves andreticences, not easily putting herself "en rapport" with those aroundher.  Books were her world from her earliest years; in them sheliterally lost and found herself.  She was eleven years old when theWar of Succession broke out, which inspired her first lyric outbursts.Her poems and translations written between the ages of fourteen andseventeen were collected, and constituted her first published volume.Crude and immature as these productions naturally were, and utterlycondemned by the writer's later judgment, they are, nevertheless,highly interesting and characteristic, giving, as they do, thekeynote of much that afterwards unfolded itself in her life.  Onecannot fail to be rather painfully impressed by the profoundmelancholy pervading the book.  The opening poem is "In Memoriam,"--on the death of a school friend and companion; and the two followingpoems also have death for theme.  "On a Lock of my Mother's Hair"givesus reflections on growing old.  These are the four poems written atthe age of fourteen.  There is not a wholly glad and joyous strain inthe volume, and we might smile at the recurrence of broken vows,broken hearts, and broken lives in the experience of this maiden justentered upon her teens, were it not that the innocent child herselfis in such deadly earnest.  The two long narrative poems, "Bertha" and"Elfrida," are tragic in the extreme.  Both are dashed off apparentlyat white heat: "Elfrida," over fifteen hundred lines of blank verse,in two weeks; "Bertha," in three and a half.  We have said that EmmaLazarus was a born singer, but she did not sing, like a bird, forjoy of being alive; and of being young, alas! there is no hint inthese youthful effusions, except inasmuch as this unrelieved gloom,this ignorance of "values," so to speak, is a sign of youth, commonespecially among gifted persons of acute and premature sensibilities,whose imagination, not yet focused by reality, overreached the mark.With Emma Lazarus, however, this sombre streak has a deeper root;something of birth and temperament is in it--the stamp and heritageof a race born to suffer.  But dominant and fundamental though it was,Hebraism was only latent thus far.  It was classic and romantic artthat first attracted and inspired her.  She pictures Aphrodite thebeautiful, arising from the waves, and the beautiful Apollo and hisloves,--Daphne, pursued by the god, changing into the laurel, and theenamored Clytie into the faithful sunflower.  Beauty, for its ownsake, supreme and unconditional, charmed her primarily and to the end.Her restless spirit found repose in the pagan idea,--the absoluteunity and identity of man with nature, as symbolized in the Greekmyths, where every natural force becomes a person, and where, in turn,persons pass with equal readiness and freedom back into nature again.In this connection a name would suggest itself even if it did notappear,--Heine, the Greek, Heine the Jew, Heine the Romanticist, asEmma Lazarus herself has styled him; and already in this early volumeof hers we have trace of the kinship and affinity that afterwards soplainly declared itself.  Foremost among the translations are anumber of his songs, rendered with a finesse and a literalness thatare rarely combined.  Four years later, at the age of twenty-one,she published her second volume, "Admetus and Other Poems," whichat once took rank as literature both in America and England, andchallenged comparison with the work of established writers.  Ofclassic themes we have "Admetus" and "Orpheus," and of romantic thelegend of Tannhauser and of the saintly Lohengrin.  All are treatedwith an artistic finish that shows perfect mastery of her craft,without detracting from the freshness and flow of her inspiration.While sounding no absolutely new note in the world, she yet makesus aware of a talent of unusual distinction, and a highly endowednature,--a sort of tact of sentiment and expression, an instinctof the true and beautiful, and that quick intuition which is likesecond-sight in its sensitiveness to apprehend and respond to externalstimulus.  But it is not the purely imaginative poems in this volumethat most deeply interest us.  We come upon experience of life inthese pages; not in the ordinary sense, however, of outward activityand movement, but in the hidden undercurrent of being.  "The epochsof our life are not in the visible facts, but in the silent thoughtsby the wayside as we walk."  This is the motto, drawn from Emerson,which she chooses for her poem of "Epochs," which marks a pivotalmoment in her life.  Difficult to analyze, difficult above all toconvey, if we would not encroach upon the domain of private andpersonal experience, is the drift of this poem, or rather cycle ofpoems, that ring throughout with a deeper accent and a more directappeal than has yet made itself felt.  It is the drama of the humansoul,--"the mystic winged and flickering butterfly," "flittingbetween earth and sky," in its passage from birth to death.A golden morning of June!  "Sweet empty sky without a stain."Sunlight and mist and "ripple of rain-fed rills."  "A murmur and asinging manifold."            "What simple things be these the soul to raise             To bounding joy, and make young pulses beat             With nameless pleasure, finding life so sweet!"Such is youth, a June day, fair and fresh and tender with dreams andlonging and vague desire. The morn lingers and passes, but the noonhas not reached its height before the clouds begin to rise, thesunshine dies, the air grows thick and heavy, the lightnings flash,the thunder breaks among the hills, rolls and gathers and grows,until                   Behold, yon bolt struck home,             And over ruined fields the storm hath come."Now we have the phases of the soul,--the shock and surprise of griefin the face of the world made desolate.  Loneliness and despair fora space, and then, like stars in the night, the new births of thespirit, the wonderful outcoming from sorrow: the mild light ofpatienceat first; hope and faith kindled afresh in the very jaws of evil;the new meaning and worth of life beyond sorrow, beyond joy; andfinally duty, the holiest word of all, that leads at last to victoryand peace.  The poem rounds and completes itself with the close of"the long, rich day," and the release of           "The mystic winged and flickering butterfly,            A human soul, that drifts at liberty,            Ah! who can tell to what strange paradise,            To what undreamed-of fields and lofty skies!"We have dwelt at some length upon this poem, which seems to us, in acertain sense, subjective and biographical; but upon closer analysisthere is still another conclusion to arrive at.  In "Epochs" we have,doubtless, the impress of a calamity brought very near to the writer,and profoundly working upon her sensibilities; not however by direct,but reflex action, as it were, and through sympathetic emotion--theemotion of the deeply-stirred spectator, of the artist, the poet wholives in the lives of others, and makes their joys and their sorrowshis own.Before dismissing this volume we may point out another clue as to theshaping of mind and character.  The poem of "Admetus" is dedicated"to my friend Ralph Waldo Emerson."  Emma Lazarus was betweenseventeen and eighteen years of age when the writings of Emersonfell into her hands, and it would be difficult to over-estimate theimpression produced upon her.  As she afterwards wrote: "To how manythousand youthful hearts has not his word been the beacon--nay,more, the guiding star--that led them safely through periods ofmental storm and struggle!"  Of no one is this more true than herself.Left, to a certain extent, without compass or guide, without anypositive or effective religious training, this was the first greatmoral revelation of her life.  We can easily realize the chaos andferment of an over-stimulated brain, steeped in romantic literature,and given over to the wayward leadings of the imagination.  Who cantell what is true, what is false, in a world where fantasy is as realas fact?  Emerson's word fell like truth itself, "a shaft of lightshot from the zenith," a golden rule of thought and action.  Hisbooks were bread and wine to her, and she absorbed them into hervery being.  She felt herself invincibly drawn to the master, "thatfount of wisdom and goodness," and it was her great privilege duringthese years to be brought into personal relations with him.  Fromthe first he showed her a marked interest and sympathy, which becamefor her one of the most valued possessions of her life.  He criticisedher work with the fine appreciation and discrimination that madehim quick to discern the quality of her talent as well as of herpersonality, and he was no doubt attracted by her almost transparentsincerity and singleness of soul, as well as by the simplicity andmodesty that would have been unusual even in a person not gifted.He constituted himself, in a way, her literary mentor, advised heras to the books she should read and the attitude of mind she shouldcultivate.  For some years he corresponded with her very faithfully;his letters are full of noble and characteristic utterances, andgive evidence of a warm regard that in itself was a stimulus and ahigh incentive.  But encouragement even from so illustrious a sourcefailed to elate the young poetess, or even to give her a due senseof the importance and value of her work, or the dignity of hervocation.  We have already alluded to her modesty in her unwillingnessto assert herself or claim any prerogative,--something even morbidand exaggerated, which we know not how to define, whether as over-sensitiveness or indifference.  Once finished, the heat and glow ofcomposition spent, her writings apparently ceased to interest her.She often resented any allusion to them on the part of intimatefriends, and the public verdict as to their excellence could notreassure or satisfy her.  The explanation is not far, perhaps, toseek.  Was it not the "Ewig-Weibliche" that allows no prestige butits own?  Emma Lazarus was a true woman, too distinctly feminine towish to be exceptional, or to stand alone and apart, even by virtueof superiority.A word now as to her life and surroundings.  She was one of a familyof seven, and her parents were both living.  Her winters were passedin New York, and her summers by the sea.  In both places her life wasessentially quiet and retired.  The success of her book had beenmainly in the world of letters.  In no wise tricked out to catch thepublic eye, her writings had not yet made her a conspicuous figure,but were destined slowly to take their proper place and give her therank that she afterwards held.For some years now almost everything that she wrote was publishedin "Lippincott's Magazine," then edited by John Foster Kirk, and weshall still find in her poems the method and movement of her life.Nature is still the fount and mirror, reflecting, and again reflected,in the soul.  We have picture after picture, almost to satiety,until we grow conscious of a lack of substance and body and of vitalplay to the thought, as though the brain were spending itself indreamings and reverie, the heart feeding upon itself, and the lifechoked by its own fullness without due outlet.  Happily, however,the heavy cloud of sadness has lifted, and we feel the subsidenceof waves after a storm.  She sings "Matins:"--                  "Does not the morn break thus,                   Swift, bright, victorious,                   With new skies cleared for us                   Over the soul storm-tost?                   Her night was long and deep,                   Strange visions vexed her sleep,                   Strange sorrows bade her weep,                   Her faith in dawn was lost.                  "No halt, no rest for her,                   The immortal wanderer                   From sphere to higher sphere                   Toward the pure source of day.                   The new light shames her fears,                   Her faithlessness and tears,                   As the new sun appears                   To light her god-like way."Nature is the perpetual resource and consolation. "'T is good to bealive!" she says, and why?  Simply,                            "To see the light            That plays upon the grass, to feel (and sigh            With perfect pleasure) the mild breeze stir              Among the garden roses, red and white,                With whiffs of fragrancy."She gives us the breath of the pines and of the cool, salt seas,"illimitably sparkling."  Her ears drink the ripple of the tide,and she stops        "To gaze as one who is not satisfied         With gazing at the large, bright, breathing sea.""Phantasies" (after Robert Schumann) is the most complete and perfectpoem of this period.  Like "Epochs," it is a cycle of poems, and theverse has caught the very trick of music,--alluring, baffling, andevasive.  This time we have the landscape of the night, the glamourof moon and stars,--pictures half real and half unreal, mysticimaginings, fancies, dreams, and the enchantment of "faerie," andthroughout the unanswered cry, the eternal "Wherefore" of destiny.Dawn ends the song with a fine clear note, the return of day, night'smisty phantoms rolled away, and the world itself, again green,sparkling and breathing freshness.In 1874 she published "Alide," a romance in prose drawn from Goethe'sautobiography.  It may be of interest to quote the letter shereceived from Tourgeneff on this occasion:--    "Although, generally speaking, I do not think it advisable    to take celebrated men, especially poets and artists, as a    subject for a novel, still I am truly glad to say that I    have read your book with the liveliest interest.  It is    very sincere and very poetical at the same time; the life    and spirit of Germany have no secrets for you, and your    characters are drawn with a pencil as delicate as it is    strong.  I feel very proud of the approbation you give to    my works, and of the influence you kindly attribute to them    on your own talent; an author who write as you do is not    a pupil in art any more; he is not far from being himself    a master."Charming and graceful words, of which the young writer was justlyproud.About this time occurred the death of her mother, the first break inthe home and family circle.  In August of 1876 she made a visit toConcord, at the Emersons', memorable enough for her to keep a journaland note down every incident and detail.  Very touching to read now,in its almost childlike simplicity, is this record of "persons thatpass and shadows that remain."  Mr. Emerson himself meets her at thestation, and drives with her in his little one-horse wagon to hishome, the gray square house, with dark green blinds, set amidst nobletrees.  A glimpse of the family,--"the stately, white-haired Mrs.Emerson, and the beautiful, faithful Ellen, whose figure seems alwaysto stand by the side of her august father."  Then the picture ofConcord itself, lovely and smiling, with its quiet meadows, quietslopes, and quietest of rivers.  She meets the little set of Concordpeople: Mr. Alcott, for whom she does not share Mr. Emerson'senthusiasm; and William Ellery Channing, whose figure stands out likea gnarled and twisted scrub-oak,--a pathetic, impossible creature,whose cranks and oddities were submitted to on account of an innatenobility of character.  "Generally crabbed and reticent withstrangers, he took a liking to me," says Emma Lazarus.  "The bondof our sympathy was my admiration for Thoreau, whose memory heactually worships, having been his constant companion in his bestdays, and his daily attendant in the last years of illness and heroicsuffering.  I do not know whether I was most touched by the thoughtof the unique, lofty character that had inspired this depth andfervor of friendship, or by the pathetic constancy and pure affectionof the poor, desolate old man before me, who tried to conceal histenderness and sense of irremediable loss by a show of gruffness andphilosophy.  He never speaks of Thoreau's death," she says, "butalways 'Thoreau's loss,' or 'when I lost Mr. Thoreau,' or 'when Mr.Thoreau went away from Concord;' nor would he confess that he missedhim, for there was not a day, an hour, a moment, when he did notfeel that his friend was still with him and had never left him.  Andyet a day or two after," she goes on to say, "when I sat with him inthe sunlit wood, looking at the gorgeous blue and silver summer sky,he turned to me and said: 'Just half of the world died for me when Ilost Mr. Thoreau.  None of it looks the same as when I looked at itwith him.'. . . He took me through the woods and pointed out to meevery spot visited and described by his friend.  Where the hut stoodis a little pile of stones, and a sign, 'Site of Thoreau's Hut,' anda few steps beyond is the pond with thickly-wooded shore,--everythingexquisitely peaceful and beautiful in the afternoon light, and nota sound to be heard except the crickets or the 'z-ing' of the locustswhich Thoreau has described.  Farther on he pointed out to me, inthe distant landscape, a low roof, the only one visible, which wasthe roof of Thoreau's birthplace.  He had been over there many times,he said, since he lost Mr. Thoreau, but had never gone in,--he wasafraid it might look lonely!  But he had often sat on a rock infront of the house and looked at it."  On parting from his youngfriend, Mr. Channing gave her a package, which proved to be a copyof his own book on Thoreau, and the pocket compass which Thoreaucarried to the Maine woods and on all his excursions.  Before leavingthe Emersons she received the proof-sheets of her drama of "TheSpagnoletto," which was being printed for private circulation.  Sheshowed them to Mr. Emerson, who had expressed a wish to see them,and, after reading them, he gave them back to her with the commentthat they were "good."  She playfully asked him if he would not giveher a bigger word to take home to the family.  He laughed, and saidhe did not know of any; but he went on to tell her that he hadtaken it up, not expecting to read it through, and had not been ableto put it down.  Every word and line told of richness in the poetry,he said, and as far as he could judge the play had great dramaticopportunities.  Early in the autumn "The Spagnoletto" appeared,--atragedy in five acts, the scene laid in Italy, 1655.Without a doubt, every one in these days will take up with misgiving,and like Mr. Emerson "not expecting to read it through," a five-acttragedy of the seventeenth century, so far removed apparently fromthe age and present actualities,--so opposed to the "Modernite,"which has come to be the last word of art.  Moreover, great names atonce appear; great shades arise to rebuke the presumptuous new-comerin this highest realm of expression.  "The Spagnoletto" has gravedefects that would probably preclude its ever being represented onthe stage.  The denoument especially is unfortunate, and sins againstour moral and aesthetic instinct.  The wretched, tiger-like fatherstabs himself in the presence of his crushed and erring daughter, sothat she may forever be haunted by the horror and the retribution ofhis death.  We are left suspended, as it were, over an abyss, ourmoral judgment thwarted, our humanity outraged.  But "The Spagnoletto"is, nevertheless, a remarkable production, and pitched in anotherkey from anything the writer has yet given us.  Heretofore we haveonly had quiet, reflective, passive emotion: now we have a stormand sweep of passion for which we were quite unprepared. Ribera'scharacter is charged like a thunder-cloud with dramatic elements.Maria Rosa is the child of her father, fired at a flash, "deaf, dumb,and blind" at the touch of passion.              "Does love steal gently o'er our soul?"she asks;                        "What if he come,                 A cloud, a fire, a whirlwind?"and then the cry:                           "O my God!            This awful joy in mine own heart is love."Again:           "While you are here the one thing real to me            In all the universe is love."Exquisitely tender and refined are the love scenes--at the ball andin the garden--between the dashing prince-lover in search of hispleasure and the devoted girl with her heart in her eyes, on herlips, in her hand.  Behind them, always like a tragic fate, thesomber figure of the Spagnoletto, and over all the glow and colorand soul of Italy.In 1881 appeared the translation of Heine's poems and ballads, whichwas generally accepted as the best version of that untranslatablepoet.  Very curious is the link between that bitter, mocking, cynicspirit and the refined, gentle spirit of Emma Lazarus.  Charmed bythe magic of his verse, the iridescent play of his fancy, and thesudden cry of the heart piercing through it all, she is as yet unawareor only vaguely conscious of the of the real bond between them: thesympathy in the blood, the deep, tragic, Judaic passion of eighteenhundred years that was smouldering in her own heart, soon to breakout and change the whole current of thought and feeling.Already, in 1879, the storm was gathering.  In a distant provinceof Russia at first, then on the banks of the Volga, and finally inMoscow itself, the old cry was raised, the hideous mediaeval chargerevived, and the standard of persecution unfurled against the Jews.Province after province took it up.  In Bulgaria, Servia, and, aboveall, Roumania, where, we were told, the sword of the Czar had beendrawn to protect the oppressed, Christian atrocities took the placeof Moslem atrocities, and history turned a page backward into the darkannals of violence and crime.  And not alone in despotic Russia, butin Germany, the seat of modern philosophic thought and culture, therage of Anti-Semitism broke out and spread with fatal ease andpotency.In Berlin itself tumults and riots were threatened.  We in Americacould scarcely comprehend the situation or credit the reports, andfor a while we shut our eyes and ears to the facts; but we were soonrudely awakened from our insensibility, and forced to face the truth.It was in England that the voice was first raised in behalf ofjustice and humanity.  In January, 1881, there appeared in the"London Times" a series of articles, carefully compiled on thetestimony of eye-witnesses, and confirmed by official documents,records, etc., giving an account of events that had been taking placein southern and western Russia during a period of nine months,between April and December of 1880.  We do not need to recall thesickening details.  The headings will suffice: outrage, murder, arson,and pillage, and the result,--100,000 Jewish families made homelessand destitute, and nearly $100,000,000 worth of property destroyed.Nor need we recall the generous outburst of sympathy and indignationfrom America.  "It is not that it is the oppression of Jews byRussia," said Mr. Evarts in the meeting at Chickering Hall Wednesdayevening, February 4; "it is that it is the oppression of men andwomen, and we are men and women."  So spoke civilized Christendom,and for Judaism,-- who can describe that thrill of brotherhood,quickened anew, the immortal pledge of the race, made one againthrough sorrow?  For Emma Lazarus it was a trumpet call that awokeslumbering and unguessed echoes.  All this time she had been seekingheroic ideals in alien stock, soulless and far removed; in paganmythology and mystic, mediaeval Christianity, ignoring her verybirthright,--the majestic vista of the past, down which, "high aboveflood and fire," had been conveyed the precious scroll of the MoralLaw.  Hitherto Judaism had been a dead letter to her.  Of Portuguesedescent, her family had always been members of the oldest and mostorthodox congregation of New York, where strict adherence to customand ceremonial was the watchword of faith; but it was only duringher childhood and earliest years that she attended the synagogue,and conformed to the prescribed rites and usages which she had nowlong since abandoned as obsolete and having no bearing on modernlife.  Nor had she any great enthusiasm for her own people.  As lateas April, 1882, she published in "The Century Magazine" an articlewritten probably some months before, entitled "Was the Earl ofBeaconsfield a Representative Jew?" in which she is disposed toaccept as the type of the modern Jew the brilliant, successful, butnot over-scrupulous chevalier d'industrie.  In view of subsequent,or rather contemporaneous events, the closing paragraph of the articlein question is worthy  of being cited:--    "Thus far their religion [the Jewish], whose mere preservation    under such adverse conditions seems little short of a miracle,    has been deprived of the natural means of development and    progress, and has remained a stationary force.  The next    hundred years will, in our opinion be the test of their    vitality as a people; the phase of toleration upon which    they are only now entering will prove whether or not they    are capable of growth."By a curious, almost fateful juxtaposition, in the same number ofthe magazine appeared Madame Ragozin's defense of Russian barbarity,and in the following (May) number Emma Lazarus's impassioned appealand reply, "Russian Christianity versus Modern Judaism."  Fromthis time dated the crusade that she undertook in behalf of her race,and the consequent expansion of all her faculties, the growth ofspiritual power which always ensues when a great cause is espousedand a strong conviction enters the soul.  Her verse rang out as ithad never rung before,--a clarion note, calling a people to heroicaction and unity, to the consciousness and fulfillment of a granddestiny.  When has Judaism been so stirred as by "The Crowing ofthe Red Cock" and                      THE BANNER OF THE JEW.              Wake, Israel, wake!  Recall to-day              The glorious Maccabean rage,              The sire heroic, hoary-gray,              His five-fold lion-lineage;              The Wise, the Elect, the Help-of-God,              The Burst-of-Spring, the Avenging Rod.              From Mizpeh's mountain ridge they saw              Jerusalem's empty streets; her shrine              Laid waste where Greeks profaned the Law              With idol and with pagan sign.              Mourners in tattered black were there              With ashes sprinkled on their hair.              Then from the stony peak there rang              A blast to ope the graves; down poured              The Maccabean clan, who sang              Their battle anthem to the Lord.              Five heroes lead, and following, see              Ten thousand rush to victory!              Oh for Jerusalem's trumpet now,              To blow a blast of shattering power,              To wake the sleeper high and low,              And rouse them to the urgent hour!              No hand for vengeance, but to save,              A million naked swords should wave.              Oh, deem not dead that martial fire,              Say not the mystic flame is spent!              With Moses' law and David's lyre,              Your ancient strength remains unbent.              Let but an Ezra rise anew,              To lift the BANNER OF THE JEW!              A rag, a mock at first,--erelong              When men have bled and women wept,              To guard its precious folds from wrong,              Even they who shrunk, even they who slept,              Shall leap to bless it and to save.              Strike! for the brave revere the brave!The dead forms burst their bonds and lived again.  She sings "RoshHashanah" (the Jewish New Year) and "Hanuckah (the Feast of Lights):--        "Kindle the taper like the steadfast star         Ablaze on Evening's forehead o'er the earth,         And add each night a lustre till afar         An eight-fold splendor shine above thy hearth.         Clash, Israel, the cymbals, touch the lyre,         Blow the brass trumpet and the harsh-tongued horn;         Chant psalms of victory till the heart take fire,         The Maccabean spirit leap new-born."  And "The New Ezekiel:"--        "What! can these dead bones live, whose sap is dried         By twenty scorching centuries of wrong?         Is this the House of Israel whose pride         Is as a tale that's told, an ancient song?         Are these ignoble relics all that live         Of psalmist, priest, and prophet?  Can the breath         Of very heaven bid these bones revive,         Open the graves, and clothe the ribs of death?         Yea, Prophesy, the Lord hath said again:         Say to the wind, come forth and breathe afresh,         Even that they may live, upon these slain,         And bone to bone shall leap, and flesh to flesh.         The spirit is not dead, proclaim the word.         Where lay dead bones a host of armed men stand!         I ope your graves, my people, saith the Lord,         And I shall place you living in your land."Her whole being renewed and refreshed itself at its very source.  Shethrew herself into the study of her race, its language, literature,and history.Breaking the outward crust, she pierced to the heart of the faithand "the miracle" of its survival.  What was it other than the ever-present, ever-vivifying spirit itself, which cannot die,--thereligious and ethical zeal which fires the whole history of thepeople, and of which she herself felt the living glow within her ownsoul?  She had come upon the secret and the genius of Judaism,--thatabsolute interpenetration and transfusion of spirit with body andsubstance which, taken literally, often reduces itself to a questionof food and drink, a dietary regulation, and again, in propersplendor,incarnates itself and shines out before humanity in the prophets,teachers, and saviors of mankind.Those were busy, fruitful years for Emma Lazarus, who worked, notwith the pen alone, but in the field of practical and beneficentactivity.  For there was an immense task to accomplish.  The tide ofimmigration had set in, and ship after ship came laden with huntedhuman beings flying from their fellow-men, while all the time, likea tocsin, rang the terrible story of cruelty and persecution,--horrorsthat the pen refuses to dwell upon.  By the hundreds and thousandsthey flocked upon our shores,--helpless, innocent victims of injusticeand oppression, panic-stricken in the midst of strange and utterlynew surroundings.Emma Lazarus came into personal contact with these people, andvisited them in their refuge on Ward Island.  While under theinfluence of all the emotions aroused by this great crisis in thehistory of her race, she wrote the "Dance of Death," a drama ofpersecution of the twelfth century, founded upon the authenticrecords,--unquestionably her finest work in grasp and scope, and, above all,in moral elevation and purport.  The scene is laid in Nordhausen, afree city in Thuringia, where the Jews, living, as the deemed, inabsolute security and peace, were caught up in the wave of persecutionthat swept over Europe at that time.  Accused of poisoning the wellsand causing the pestilence, or black death, as it was called, theywere condemned to be burned.We do not here intend to enter upon a critical or literary analysisof the play, or to point out dramatic merits or defects, but weshould like to make its readers feel with us the holy ardor andimpulse of the writer and the spiritual import of the work.  Theaction is without surprise, the doom fixed from the first; but soglowing is the canvas with local and historic color, so vital andintense the movement, so resistless, the "internal evidence," if wemay call it thus, penetrating its very substance and form, that we areswept along as by a wave of human sympathy and grief.  In contrastwith "The Spagnoletto," how large is the theme and how all-embracingthe catastrophe!  In place of the personal we have the drama ofthe universal.  Love is only a flash now,--a dream caught sight ofand at once renounced at a higher claim.        "Have you no smile to welcome love with, Liebhaid?         Why should you tremble?         Prince, I am afraid!         Afraid of my own heart, my unfathomed joy,         A blasphemy against my father's grief,         My people's agony!        "What good shall come, forswearing kith and God,         To follow the allurements of the heart?"asks the distracted maiden, torn between her love for he princelywooer and her devotion to the people among whom her lot has been cast.                                      "O God!            How shall I pray for strength to love him less            Than mine own soul!                                       No more of that,            I am all Israel's now.  Till this cloud pass,            I have no thought, no passion, no desire,            Save for my people."Individuals perish, but great ideas survive,--fortitude and courage,and that exalted loyalty and devotion to principle which alone areworth living and dying for.The Jews pass by in procession--men, women, and children--on theirway to the flames, to the sound of music, and in festal array,carryingthe gold and silver vessels, the roll of the law, the perpetual lampand the seven branched silver candle-stick of the synagogue.  Thecrowd hoot and jeer at them.           "The misers! they will take their gems and gold            Down to the grave!"                             "Let us rejoice"sing the Jewish youths in chorus; and the maidens:--           "Our feet stand within thy gates, O Zion!             Within thy portals, O Jerusalem!"The flames rise and dart among them; their garments wave, their jewelsflash, as they dance and sing in the crimson blaze.  The music ceases,a sound of crashing boards is heard and a great cry,--"Hallelujah!"What a glory and consecration of the martyrdom!  Where shall we find amore triumphant vindication and supreme victory of spirit over matter?                            "I see, I see,         How Israel's ever-crescent glory makes         These flames that would eclipse it dark as blots         Of candle-light against the blazing sun.         We die a thousand deaths,--drown, bleed, and burn.         Our ashes are dispersed unto the winds.         Yet the wild winds cherish the sacred seed,         The fire refuseth to consume.            .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .         Even as we die in honor, from our death         Shall bloom a myriad heroic lives,         Brave through our bright example, virtuous         Lest our great memory fall in disrepute."The "Dance to Death" was published, along with other poems andtranslations from the Hebrew poets of mediaeval Spain, in a smallcolumn entitled "Songs of a Semite."  The tragedy was dedicated, "Inprofound veneration and respect to the memory of George Eliot, theillustrious writer who did most among the artists of our day towardselevating and ennobling the spirit of Jewish nationality."For this was the idea that had caught the imagination of Emma Lazarus,--a restored and independent nationality and repatriation inPalestine.In her article in "The Century" of February, 1883, on the "JewishProblem," she says:--    "I am fully persuaded that all suggested solutions other    than this are but temporary palliatives. . . . The idea    formulated by George Eliot has already sunk into the minds    of many Jewish enthusiasts, and it germinates with miraculous    rapidity.  'The idea that I am possessed with,' says Deronda,    'is that of restoring a political existence to my people;    making them a nation again, giving them a national centre,    such as the English have, though they, too, are scattered    over the face of the globe.  That task which presents itself    to me as a duty. . . . I am resolved to devote my life to    it.  AT THE LEAST, I MAY AWAKEN A MOVEMENT IN OTHER MINDS    SUCH HAS BEEN AWAKENED IN MY OWN.'  Could the noble    prophetess who wrote the above words have lived but till to-    day to see the ever-increasing necessity of adopting her    inspired counsel, . . .she would have been herself astonished    at the flame enkindled by her seed of fire, and the practical    shape which the movement projected by her poetic vision is    beginning to assume."In November of 1882 appeared her first "Epistle to the Hebrews,"--one of a series of articles written for the "American Hebrew,"published weekly through several months.  Addressing herself nowto a Jewish audience, she sets forth without reserve her views andhopes for Judaism, now passionately holding up the mirror for theshortcomings and peculiarities of her race.  She says:--    "Every student of the Hebrew language is aware that we have    in the conjugation of our verbs a mode known as the 'intensive    voice,' which, by means of an almost imperceptible modification    of vowel-points, intensifies the meaning of the primitive root.    A similar significance seems to attach to the Jews themselves    in connection with the people among whom they dwell.  They are    the 'intensive form' of any nationality whose language and    customs they adopt. . . . Influenced by the same causes, they    represent the same results; but the deeper lights and shadows    of the Oriental temperament throw their failings, as well as    their virtues, into more prominent relief."In drawing the epistles to a close, February 24, 1883, she thussummarizes the special objects she has had in view:--    "My chief aim has been to contribute my mite towards arousing    that spirit of Jewish enthusiasm which might manifest itself:    First, in a return to varied pursuits and broad system of    physical and intellectual education adopted by our ancestors;    Second, in a more fraternal and practical movement towards    alleviating the sufferings of oppressed Jews in countries less    favored than our own; Third, in a closer and wider study of    Hebrew literature and history and finally, in a truer recognition    of the large principals of religion, liberty, and law upon    which Judaism is founded, and which should draw into harmonious    unity Jews of every shade of opinion."Her interest in Jewish affairs was at its height when she planned avisit abroad, which had been a long-cherished dream, and May 15, 1883,she sailed for England, accompanied by a younger sister.  We havedifficulty in recognizing the tragic priestess we have been portrayingin the enthusiastic child of travel who seems new-born into a newworld.  From the very outset she is in a maze of wonder and delight.At sea she writes:--    "Our last day on board ship was a vision of beauty from    morning till night,--the sea like a mirror and the sky    dazzling with light.  In the afternoon we passed a ship    in full sail, near enough to exchange salutes and cheers.    After tossing about for six days without seeing a human    being, except those on our vessel, even this was a sensation.    Then an hour or two before sunset came the great sensation    of--land!  At first, nothing but a shadow on the far horizon,    like the ghost of a ship; two or three widely scattered rocks    which were the promontories of Ireland, and sooner than we    expected we were steaming along low-lying purple hills."The journey to Chester gives her "the first glimpse of mellowEngland,"--a surprise which is yet no surprise, so well known andfamiliar does it appear.  Then Chester, with its quaint, picturesquestreets, "like the scene of a Walter Scott novel, the cathedralplanted in greenness, and the clear, gray river where a boatful ofscarlet dragoons goes gliding by."  Everything is a picture for herspecial benefit.  She "drinks in, at every sense, the sights, sounds,and smells, and the unimaginable beauty of it all."  Then thebewilderment of London, and a whirl of people, sights, andimpressions.She was received with great distinction by the Jews, and many of theleading men among them warmly advocated her views.  But it was notalone from her own people that she met with exceptional consideration.She had the privilege of seeing many of the most eminent personagesof the day, all of whom honored her with special and personal regard.There was, no doubt, something that strongly attracted people to herat this time,--the force of her intellect at once made itself felt,while at the same time the unaltered simplicity and modesty of hercharacter, and her readiness and freshness of enthusiasm, kept herstill almost like a child.She makes a flying visit to Paris, where she happens to be on the 14thof July, the anniversary of the storming of the Bastile, and of thebeginning of the republic; she drives to Versailles, "that gorgeousshell of royalty, where the crowd who celebrate the birth of therepublic wander freely through the halls and avenues, and into themost sacred rooms of the king. . . . There are ruins on every side inParis," she says; "ruins of the Commune, or the Siege, or theRevolution; it is terrible--it seems as if the city were seared withfire and blood."Such was Paris to her then, and she hastens back to her belovedLondon,starting from there on the tour through England that has been mappedout for her.  "A Day in Surrey with William Morris," published in"The Century Magazine," describes her visit to Merton Abbey, theold  Norman monastery, converted into a model factory by the poet-humanitarian, who himself received her as his guest, conducted herall over the picturesque building and garden, and explained to herhis views of art and his aims for the people.She drives through Kent, "where the fields, valleys, and slopes aregarlanded with hops and ablaze with scarlet poppies."  ThenCanterbury,Windsor, and Oxford, Stratford, Warwick, the valley of the Wye, Wells,Exeter, and Salisbury,--cathedral after cathedral.  Back to London,and then north through York, Durham, and Edinburgh, and on the 15thof September she sails for home.  We have merely named the names,for it is impossible to convey an idea of the delight and importanceof this trip, "a crescendo of enjoyment," as she herself calls it.Long after, in strange, dark hours of suffering, these pictures oftravel arose before her, vivid and tragic even in their hold andspell upon her.The winter of 1883-84 was not especially productive.  She wrote afew reminiscences of her journey and occasional poems on the Jewishthemes, which appeared in the "American Hebrew;" but for the mostpart gave herself up to quiet retrospect and enjoyment with herfriends of the life she had had a glimpse of, and the experience shehad stored,--a restful, happy period.  In August of the same yearshe was stricken with a severe and dangerous malady, from which sheslowly recovered, only to go through a terrible ordeal and affliction.Her father's health, which had long been failing, now broke downcompletely, and the whole winter was one long strain of acute anxiety,which culminated in his death, in March, 1885.  The blow was acrushing one for Emma.  Truly, the silver cord was loosed, and thegolden bowl broken.  Life lost its meaning and charm.  Her father'ssympathy and pride in her work had been her chief incentive andambition, and had spurred her on when her own confidence and spiritfailed.  Never afterwards did she find complete and spontaneousexpression.  She decided to go abroad as the best means of regainingcomposure and strength and sailed once more in May for England,where she was welcomed now by the friends she had made, almost asto another home.  She spent the summer very quietly at Richmond,anideally beautiful spot in Yorkshire, where she soon felt thebeneficial influence of her peaceful surroundings.  "The very airseems to rest one here," she writes; and inspired by the romanticloveliness of the place, she even composed the first few chaptersof a novel, begun with a good deal of dash and vigor, but soonabandoned, for she was still struggling with depression and gloom."I have neither ability, energy, nor purpose," she writes.  "It isimpossible to do anything, so I am forced to set it aside for thepresent; whether to take it up again or not in the future remainsto be seen."In the autumn she goes on the Continent, visiting the Hague, which"completely fascinates" her, and where she feels "stronger and morecheerful" than she has "for many a day."  Then Paris, which this timeamazes her "with its splendor and magnificence.  All the ghosts ofthe Revolution are somehow laid," she writes, and she spends sixweeks here enjoying to the full the gorgeous autumn weather, thesights, the picture galleries, the bookshops, the whole brilliantpanorama of the life; and early in December she starts for Italy.And now once more we come upon that keen zest of enjoyment, thatpure desire and delight of the eyes, which are the prerogative ofthe poet,--Emma Lazarus was a poet.  The beauty of the world,--whata rapture and intoxication it is, and how it bursts upon her in thevery land of beauty, "where Dante and Petrarch trod!"  A magic glowcolours it all; no mere blues and greens anymore, but a splendor ofpurple and scarlet and emerald; "each tower, castle, and villageshining like a jewel; the olive, the fig, and at your feet the roses,growing in mid-December."  A day in Pisa seems like a week, so crowdedis it with sensations and unforgettable pictures.  Then a month inFlorence, which is still more entrancing with its inexhaustibletreasures of beauty and art; and finally Rome, the climax of it all,--    "wiping out all other places and impressions, and opening    a whole new world of sensations.  I am wild with the    excitement of this tremendous place.  I have been here a    week, and have seen the Vatican and the Capitoline Museums,    and the Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter's, besides the ruins    on the streets and on the hills, and the graves of Shelley    and Keats.    "It is all heart-breaking.  I don't only mean those beautiful    graves, overgrown with acanthus and violets, but the mutilated    arches and columns and dumb appealing fragments looming up in    the glowing sunshine under the Roman blue sky."True to her old attractions, it is pagan Rome that appeals to hermost strongly,--    "and the far-away past, that seems so sad and strange and    near.  I am even out of humor with pictures; a bit of broken    stone or a  fragment of a bas-relief, or a Corinthian column    standing out against this lapis-lazuli sky, or a tremendous    arch, are the only things I can look at for the moment,--    except the Sistine Chapel, which is as gigantic as the rest,    and forces itself upon you with equal might."Already, in February, spring is in the air; "the almond-trees are inbloom, violets cover the grass, and oh! the divine, the celestial,the unheard-of beauty of it all!"  It is almost a pang for her, "withits strange mixture of longing and regret and delight," and in themidst of it she says, "I have to exert all my strength not to losemyself in morbidness and depression."Early in March she leaves Rome, consoled with the thought of returningthe following winter.  In June she was in England again, and spentthe summer at Malvern.  Disease was no doubt already beginning toprey upon her, for she was oppressed at times by a languor andheaviness amounting almost to lethargy.  When she returned to London,however, in September, she felt quite well again, and started foranother tour in Holland, which she enjoyed as much as before.  Shethen settled in Paris, to await the time when she could return toItaly.  But she was attacked at once with grave and alarming symptoms,that betokened a fatal end to her malady.  Entirely ignorant, however,of the danger that threatened her, she kept up courage and hope,made plans for the journey, and looked forward to setting out atany moment.  But the weeks passed and the months also; slowly andgradually the hope faded.  The journey to Italy must be given up;she was not in condition to be brought home, and she reluctantlyresigned herself to remain where she was and "convalesce," as sheconfidently believed, in the spring.  Once again came the analogy,which she herself pointed out now, to Heine on his mattress-gravein Paris.  She, too, the last time she went out, dragged herself tothe Louvre, to the feet of the Venus, "the goddess without arms, whocould not help."  Only her indomitable will and intense desire tolive seemed to keep her alive.  She sunk to a very low ebb, but, asshe herself expressed it, she "seemed to have always one littlewindow looking out into life," and in the spring she ralliedsufficiently to take a few drives and to sit on the balcony of herapartment.  She came back to life with a feverish sort of thirst andavidity.  "No such cure for pessimism," she says, "as a severeillness;the simplest pleasures are enough,--to breathe the air and see thesun."Many plans were made for leaving Paris, but it was finally decidedto risk the ocean voyage and bring her home, and accordingly shesailed July 23rd, arriving in New York on the last day of that month.She did not rally after this; and now began her long agony, fullof every kind of suffering, mental and physical.  Only her intellectseemed kindled anew, and none but those who saw her during the lastsupreme ordeal can realize that wonderful flash and fire of thespirit before its extinction.  Never did she appear so brilliant.Wasted to a shadow, and between acute attacks of pain, she talkedabout art, poetry, the scenes of travel, of which her brain was sofull, and the phases of her own condition, with an eloquence forwhich even those who knew her best were quite unprepared.  Everyfaculty seemed sharpened and every sense quickened as the "strongdeliveress" approached, and the ardent soul was released from theframe that could no longer contain it.We cannot restrain a feeling of suddenness and incompleteness anda natural pang of wonder and regret for a life so richly and sovitally endowed thus cut off in its prime.  But for us it is notfitting to question or repine, but rather to rejoice in the rarepossession that we hold.  What is any life, even the most roundedand complete, but a fragment and a hint?  What Emma Lazarus mighthave accomplished, had she been spared, it is idle and evenungrateful to speculate.  What she did accomplish has real andpeculiar significance.  It is the privilege of a favored few thatevery fact and circumstance of their individuality shall add lustreand value to what they achieve.  To be born a Jewess was a distinctionfor Emma Lazarus, and she in turn conferred distinction upon herrace.  To be born a woman also lends a grace and a subtle magnetismto her influence.  Nowhere is there contradiction or incongruity.Her works bear the imprint of her character, and her character ofher works; the same directness and honesty, the same limpid purityof tone, and the same atmosphere of things refined and beautiful.The vulgar, the false, and the ignoble,--she scarcely comprehendedthem, while on every side she was open and ready to take in andrespond to whatever can adorn and enrich life.  Literature was nomere "profession" for her, which shut out other possibilities; itwas only a free, wide horizon and background for culture.  She waspassionately devoted to music, which inspired some of her best poems;and during the last years of her life, in hours of intense physicalsuffering, she found relief and consolation in listening to thestrains of Bach and Beethoven.  When she went abroad, painting wasrevealed to her, and she threw herself with the same ardor andenthusiasm into the study of the great masters; her last work (leftunfinished) was a critical analysis of the genius and personalityof Rembrandt.And now, at the end, we ask, Has the grave really closed over allthese gifts?  Has that eager, passionate striving ceased, and "isthe rest silence?"Who knows?  But would we break, if we could, that repose, thatsilence and mystery and peace everlasting?                        EPOCHS. "The epochs of our life are not in the facts, but in the    silent thought by the wayside as we walk."--Emerson               I. Youth.Sweet empty sky of June without a stain,  Faint, gray-blue dewy mists on far-off hills,Warm, yellow sunlight flooding mead and plain,  That each dark copse and hollow overfills;  The rippling laugh of unseen, rain-fed rills,Weeds delicate-flowered, white and pink and gold,A murmur and a singing manifold.The gray, austere old earth renews her youth  With dew-lines, sunshine, gossamer, and haze.How still she lies and dreams, and veils the truth,  While all is fresh as in the early days!  What simple things be these the soul to raiseTo bounding joy, and make young pulses beat,With nameless pleasure finding life so sweet.On such a golden morning forth there floats,  Between the soft earth and the softer sky,In the warm air adust with glistening motes,  The mystic winged and flickering butterfly,  A human soul, that hovers giddilyAmong the gardens of earth's paradise,Nor dreams of fairer fields or loftier skies.               II. Regret.Thin summer rain on grass and bush and hedge,  Reddening the road and deepening the greenOn wide, blurred lawn, and in close-tangled sedge;  Veiling in gray the landscape stretched between  These low broad meadows and the pale hills seenBut dimly on the far horizon's edge.In these transparent-clouded, gentle skies,  Wherethrough the moist beams of the soft June sunMight any moment break, no sorrow lies,  No note of grief in swollen brooks that run,  No hint of woe in this subdued, calm toneOf all the prospect unto dreamy eyes.Only a tender, unnamed half-regret  For the lost beauty of the gracious morn;A yearning aspiration, fainter yet,  For brighter suns in joyous days unborn,  Now while brief showers ruffle grass and corn,And all the earth lies shadowed, grave, and wet;Space for the happy soul to pause again  From pure content of all unbroken bliss,To dream the future void of grief and pain,  And muse upon the past, in reveries  More sweet for knowledge that the present isNot all complete, with mist and clouds and rain.               III. Longing.Look westward o'er the steaming rain-washed slopes,  Now satisfied with sunshine, and beholdThose lustrous clouds, as glorious as our hopes,  Softened with feathery fleece of downy gold,  In all fantastic, huddled shapes uprolled,Floating like dreams, and melting silently,In the blue upper regions of pure sky.The eye is filled with beauty, and the heart  Rejoiced with sense of life and peace renewed;And yet at such an hour as this, upstart  Vague myriad longing, restless, unsubdued,  And causeless tears from melancholy mood,Strange discontent with earth's and nature's best,Desires and yearnings that may find no rest.               IV. Storm.Serene was morning with clear, winnowed air,  But threatening soon the low, blue mass of cloudRose in the west, with mutterings faint and rare  At first, but waxing frequent and more loud.  Thick sultry mists the distant hill-tops shroud;The sunshine dies; athwart black skies of leadFlash noiselessly thin threads of lightning red.Breathless the earth seems waiting some wild blow,  Dreaded, but far too close to ward or shun.Scared birds aloft fly aimless, and below  Naught stirs in fields whence light and life are gone,  Save floating leaves, with wisps of straw and down,Upon the heavy air; 'neath blue-black skies,Livid and yellow the green landscape lies.And all the while the dreadful thunder breaks,  Within the hollow circle of the hills,With gathering might, that angry echoes wakes,  And earth and heaven with unused clamor fills.  O'erhead still flame those strange electric thrills.A moment more,--behold! yon bolt struck home,And over ruined fields the storm hath come!               V. Surprise.When the stunned soul can first lift tired eyes  On her changed world of ruin, waste and wrack,Ah, what a pang of aching sharp surprise  Brings all sweet memories of the lost past back,With wild self-pitying grief of one betrayed,Duped in a land of dreams where Truth is dead!Are these the heavens that she deemed were kind?  Is this the world that yesterday was fair?What painted images of folk half-blind  Be these who pass her by, as vague as air?What go they seeking? there is naught to find.Let them come nigh and hearken her despair.A mocking lie is all she once believed,  And where her heart throbbed, is a cold dead stone.This is a doom we never preconceived,  Yet now she cannot fancy it undone.Part of herself, part of the whole hard scheme,All else is but the shadow of a dream.               VI. Grief.There is a hungry longing in the soul,  A craving sense of emptiness and pain,She may not satisfy nor yet control,  For all the teeming world looks void and vain.No compensation in eternal spheres,She knows the loneliness of all her years.There is no comfort looking forth nor back,  The present gives the lie to all her past.Will cruel time restore what she doth lack?  Why was no shadow of this doom forecast?Ah! she hath played with many a keen-edged thing;Naught is too small and soft to turn and sting.In the unnatural glory of the hour,  Exalted over time, and death, and fate,No earthly task appears beyond her power,  No possible endurance seemeth great.She knows her misery and her majesty,And recks not if she be to live or die.               VII. Acceptance.Yea, she hath looked Truth grimly face to face,  And drained unto the lees the proffered cup.This silence is not patience, nor the grace  Of recognition, meekly offered up,But mere acceptance fraught with keenest pain,Seeing that all her struggles must be vain.Her future clear and terrible outlies,--  This burden to be borne through all her days,This crown of thorns pressed down above her eyes,  This weight of trouble she may never raise.No reconcilement doth she ask nor wait;Knowing such things are, she endures her fate.No brave endeavor of the broken will  To cling to such poor stays as will abide(Although the waves be wild and angry still)  After the lapsing of the swollen tide.No fear of further loss, no hope of gain,Naught but the apathy of weary pain.               VIII. Loneliness.All stupor of surprise hath passed away;  She sees, with clearer vision than before,A world far off of light and laughter gay,  Herself alone and lonely evermore.Folk come and go, and reach her in no wise,Mere flitting phantoms to her heavy eyes.All outward things, that once seemed part of her,  Fall from her, like the leaves in autumn shed.She feels as one embalmed in spice and myrrh,  With the heart eaten out, a long time dead;Unchanged without, the features and the form;Within, devoured by the thin red worm.By her own prowess she must stand or fall,  This grief is to be conquered day by day.Who could befriend her? who could make this small,  Or her strength great? she meets it as she may.A weary struggle and a constant pain,She dreams not they may ever cease nor wane.               IX. Sympathy.It comes not in such wise as she had deemed,  Else might she still have clung to her despair.More tender, grateful than she could have dreamed,  Fond hands passed pitying over brows and hair,  And gentle words borne softly through the air,Calming her weary sense and wildered mind,By welcome, dear communion with her kind.Ah! she forswore all words as empty lies;  What speech could help, encourage, or repair?Yet when she meets these grave, indulgent eyes,  Fulfilled with pity, simplest words are fair,  Caressing, meaningless, that do not dareTo compensate or mend, but merely sootheWith hopeful visions after bitter Truth.One who through conquered trouble had grown wise,  To read the grief unspoken, unexpressed, The misery of the blank and heavy eyes,--  Or through youth's infinite compassion guessed  The heavy burden,--such a one brought rest,And bade her lay aside her doubts and fears,While the hard pain dissolved in blessed tears.               X. Patience.The passion of despair is quelled at last;  The cruel sense of undeserved wrong,The wild self-pity, these are also past;  She knows not what may come, but she is strong;She feels she hath not aught to lose nor gain,Her patience is the essence of all pain.As one who sits beside a lapsing stream,  She sees the flow of changeless day by day,Too sick and tired to think, too sad to dream,  Nor cares how soon the waters slip away,Nor where they lead; at the wise God's decree,She will depart or bide indifferently.There is deeper pathos in the mild  And settled sorrow of the quiet eyes,Than in the tumults of the anguish wild,  That made her curse all things beneath the skies;No question, no reproaches, no complaint,Hers is the holy calm of some meek saint.               XI. Hope.Her languid pulses thrill with sudden hope,  That will not be forgot nor cast aside,And life in statelier vistas seems to ope,  Illimitably lofty, long, and wide.What doth she know?  She is subdued and mild,Quiet and docile "as a weaned child."If grief came in such unimagined wise,  How may joy dawn?  In what undreamed-of hour,May the light break with splendor of surprise,  Disclosing all the mercy and the power?A baseless hope, yet vivid, keen, and bright,As the wild lightning in the starless night.She knows not whence it came, nor where it passed,  But it revealed, in one brief flash of flame,A heaven so high, a world so rich and vast,  That, full of meek contrition and mute shame,In patient silence hopefully withdrawn,She bows her head, and bides the certain dawn.               XII. Compensation.'T is not alone that black and yawning void  That makes her heart ache with this hungry pain,But the glad sense of life hath been destroyed,  The lost delight may never come again.Yet myriad serious blessings with grave graceArise on every side to fill their place.For much abides in her so lonely life,--  The dear companionship of her own kind,Love where least looked for, quiet after strife,  Whispers of promise upon every wind,A quickened insight, in awakened eyes,For the new meaning of the earth and skies.The nameless charm about all things hath died,  Subtle as aureole round a shadow's head,Cast on the dewy grass at morning-tide;  Yet though the glory and the joy be fled,'T is much her own endurance to have weighed,And wrestled with God's angels, unafraid.               XIII. Faith.She feels outwearied, as though o'er her head  A storm of mighty billows broke and passed.Whose hand upheld her?  Who her footsteps led  To this green haven of sweet rest at last?What strength was hers, unreckoned and unknown?What love sustained when she was most alone?Unutterably pathetic her desire,  To reach, with groping arms outstretched in prayer,Something to cling to, to uplift her higher  From this low world of coward fear and care,Above disaster, that her will may beAt one with God's, accepting his decree.Though by no reasons she be justified,  Yet strangely brave in Evil's very face,She deems this want must needs be satisfied,  Though here all slips from out her weak embrace.And in blind ecstasy of perfect faith,With her own dream her prayer she answereth.               XIV. Work.Yet life is not a vision nor a prayer,  But stubborn work; she may not shun her task.After the first compassion, none will spare  Her portion and her work achieved, to ask.She pleads for respite,--she will come ere longWhen, resting by the roadside, she is strong.Nay, for the hurrying throng of passers-by  Will crush her with their onward-rolling stream.Much must be done before the brief light die;  She may not loiter, rapt in the vain dream.With unused trembling hands, and faltering feet,She staggers forth, her lot assigned to meet.But when she fills her days with duties done,  Strange vigor comes, she is restored to health.New aims, new interests rise with each new sun,  And life still holds for her unbounded wealth.All that seemed hard and toilsome now proves small,And naught may daunt her,--she hath strength for all.               XV. Victory.How strange, in some brief interval of rest,  Backward to look on her far-stretching past.To see how much is conquered and repressed,  How much is gained in victory at last!The shadow is not lifted,--but her faith,Strong from life's miracles, now turns toward death.Though much be dark where once rare splendor shone,  Yet the new light has touched high peaks unguessedIn her gold, mist-bathed dawn, and one by one  New outlooks loom from many a mountain crest.She breathes a loftier, purer atmosphere,And life's entangled paths grow straight and clear.Nor will Death prove an all-unwelcome guest;  The struggle has been toilsome to this end,Sleep will be sweet, and after labor rest,  And all will be atoned with him to friend.Much must be reconciled, much justified,And yet she feels she will be satisfied.               XVI. Peace.The calm outgoing of a long, rich day,  Checkered with storm and sunshine, gloom and light,Now passing in pure, cloudless skies away,  Withdrawing into silence of blank night.  Thick shadows settle on the landscape bright,Like the weird cloud of death that falls apaceOn the still features of the passive face.Soothing and gentle as a mother's kiss,  The touch that stopped the beating of the heart.A look so blissfully serene as this,  Not all the joy of living could impart.With dauntless faith and courage therewithal,The Master found her ready at his call.On such a golden evening forth there floats,  Between the grave earth and the glowing skyIn the clear air, unvexed with hazy motes,  The mystic-winged and flickering butterfly,  A human soul, that drifts at liberty,Ah! who can tell to what strange paradise,To what undreamed-of fields and lofty skies.!               HOW LONG?  How long, and yet how long,Our leaders will we hail from over seas,Master and kings from feudal monarchies,  And mock their ancient songWith echoes weak of foreign melodies?  That distant isle mist-wreathed,Mantled in unimaginable green,Too long hath been our mistress and our queen.  Our fathers have bequeathedToo deep a love for her, our hearts within.  She made the whole world ringWith the brave exploits of her children strong,And with the matchless music of her song.  Too late, too late we clingTo alien legends, and their strains prolong.  This fresh young world I see,With heroes, cities, legends of her own;With a new race of men, and overblown  By winds from sea to sea,Decked with the majesty of every zone.  I see the glittering topsOf snow-peaked mounts, the wid'ning vale's expanse,Large prairies where free herds of horses prance,  Exhaustless wealth of crops,In vast, magnificent extravagance.  These grand, exuberant plains,These stately rivers, each with many a mouth,The exquisite beauty of the soft-aired south,  The boundless seas of grains,Luxuriant forests' lush and splendid growth.  The distant siren-songOf the green island in the eastern sea,Is not the lay for this new chivalry.  It is not free and strongTo chant on prairies 'neath this brilliant sky.  The echo faints and fails;It suiteth not, upon this western plain,Out voice or spirit; we should stir again  The wilderness, and make the valesResound unto a yet unheard-of strain.               HEROES.  In rich Virginian woods,The scarlet creeper reddens over graves,Among the solemn trees enlooped with vines;Heroic spirits haunt the solitudes,--The noble souls of half a million braves,  Amid the murmurous pines.  Ah! who is left behind,Earnest and eloquent, sincere and strong,To consecrate their memories with wordsNot all unmeet? with fitting dirge and songTo chant a requiem purer than the wind,  And sweeter than the birds?  Here, though all seems at peace,The placid, measureless sky serenely fair,The laughter of the breeze among the leaves,The bars of sunlight slanting through the trees,The reckless wild-flowers blooming everywhere,  The grasses' delicate sheaves,--  Nathless each breeze that blows,Each tree that trembles to its leafy headWith nervous life, revives within our mind,Tender as flowers of May, the thoughts of thoseWho lie beneath the living beauty, dead,--  Beneath the sunshine, blind.  For brave dead soldiers, these:Blessings and tears of aching thankfulness,Soft flowers for the graves in wreaths enwove,The odorous lilac of dear memories,The heroic blossoms of the wilderness,  And the rich rose of love.  But who has sung their praise,Not less illustrious, who are living yet?Armies of heroes, satisfied to passCalmly, serenely from the whole world's gaze,And cheerfully accept, without regret,  Their old life as it was,  With all its petty pain,Its irritating littleness and care;They who have scaled the mountain, with contentSublime, descend to live upon the plain;Steadfast as though they breathed the mountain-air  Still, wheresoe'er they went.  They who were brave to act,And rich enough their action to forget;Who, having filled their day with chivalry,Withdraw and keep their simpleness intact,And all unconscious add more lustre yet  Unto their victory.  On the broad Western plainsTheir patriarchal life they live anew;Hunters as mighty as the men of old,Or harvesting the plenteous, yellow grains,Gathering ripe vintage of dusk bunches blue,Or working mines of gold;  Or toiling in the town,Armed against hindrance, weariness, defeat,With dauntless purpose not to serve or yield,And calm, defiant, they struggle on,As sturdy and as valiant in the street,  As in the camp and field.  And those condemned to live,Maimed, helpless, lingering still through suffering years,May they not envy now the restful sleepOf the dear fellow-martyrs they survive?Not o'er the dead, but over these, your tears,  O brothers, ye may weep!  New England fields I see,The lovely, cultured landscape, waving grain,Wide haughty rivers, and pale, English skies.And lo! a farmer ploughing busily,Who lifts a swart face, looks upon the plain,--  I see, in his frank eyes,  The hero's soul appear.Thus in the common fields and streets they stand;The light that on the past and distant gleams,They cast upon the present and the near,With antique virtues from some mystic land,  Of knightly deeds and dreams.               ADMETUS.    To my friend, Ralph Waldo Emerson.  He who could beard the lion in his lair,To bind him for a girl, and tame the boar,And drive these beasts before his chariot,Might wed Alcestis.  For her low brows' sake,Her hairs' soft undulations of warm gold,Her eyes clear color and pure virgin mouth,Though many would draw bow or shiver spear,Yet none dared meet the intolerable eye,Or lipless tusk, of lion or boar.This heard Admetus, King of Thessaly,Whose broad, fat pastures spread their ample fieldsDown to the sheer edge of Amphrysus' stream,Who laughed, disdainful, at the father's pride,That set such value on one milk-faced child.  One morning, as he rode alone and passedThrough the green twilight of Thessalian woods,Between two pendulous branches interlocked,As through an open casement, he descriedA goddess, as he deemed,--in truth a maid.On a low bank she fondled tenderlyA favorite hound, her floral face inclinedabove the glossy, graceful animal,That pressed his snout against her cheek and gazedWistfully, with his keen, sagacious eyes.One arm with lax embrace the neck enwreathed,With polished roundness near the sleek, gray skin.Admetus, fixed with wonder,dare not pass,Intrusive on her holy innocenceAnd sacred girlhood, but his fretful steedSnuffed the air, and champed and pawed the ground;And hearing this, the maiden raised her head.No let or hindrance then might stop the king,Once having looked upon those supreme eyes.The drooping boughs disparting, forth he sped,And then drew in his steed, to ask the path,Like a lost traveller in an alien land.Although each river-cloven vale, with streamsArrowy glancing to the blue Aegean,Each hallowed mountain, the abode of gods,Pelion and Ossa fringed with haunted groves,The height, spring-crowned, of dedicate Olympus,And pleasant sun-fed vineyards, were to himFamiliar as his own face in the stream,Nathless he paused and asked the maid what pathMight lead him from the forest.  She replied,But still he tarried, and with sportsman's praiseAdmired the hound and stooped to stroke its head,And asked her if she hunted.  Nay, not she:Her father Pelias hunted in these woods,Where there was royal game.  He knew her now,--Alcestis,--and he left her with due thanks:No goddess, but a mortal, to be wonBy such a simple feat as driving boarsAnd lions to his chariot.  What was thatTo him who saw the boar of Calydon,The sacred boar of Artemis, at bayIn the broad stagnant marsh, and sent his dartsIn its tough, quivering flank, and saw its death,Stung by sure arrows of Arcadian nymph?  To river-pastures of his flocks and herdsAdmetus rode, where sweet-breathed cattle grazed,Heifers and goats and kids, and foolish sheepDotted cool, spacious meadows with bent heads,And necks' soft wool broken in yellow flakes,Nibbling sharp-toothed the rich, thick-growing blades.One herdsman kept the innumerable droves--A boy yet, young as immortality--In listless posture on a vine-grown rock.Around him huddled kids and sheep that leftThe mother's udder for his nighest grass,Which sprouted with fresh verdure where he sat.And yet dull neighboring rustics never guessedA god had been among them till he went,Although with him they acted as he willed,Renouncing shepherds' silly pranks and quips,Because his very presence made them grave.Amphryssius, after their translucent stream,They called him, but Admetus knew his name,--Hyperion, god of sun and song and silver speech,Condemned to serve a mortal for his sinTo Zeus in sending violent darts of death,A raising hand irreverent, againstThe one-eyed forgers of the thunderbolt.For shepherd's crook he held the living rodOf twisted serpents, later Hermes' wand.Him sought the king, discovering soon hard by,Idle as one in nowise bound to time,Watching the restless grasses blow and wave,The sparkle of the sun upon the stream,Regretting nothing, living with the hour:For him, who had his light and song within,Was naught that did not shine, and all things sang.Admetus prayed for his celestial aidTo win Alcestis, which the god vouchsafed,Granting with smiles, as grant all gods, who smiteWith stern hand, sparing not for piteousness,But give their gifts in gladness.                                   Thus the kingLed with loose rein the beasts as tame as kine,And townsfolk thronged within the city streets,As round a god; and mothers showed their babes,And maidens loved the crowned intrepid youth,And men aloud worship, though the very godWho wrought the wonder dwelled unnoted nigh,Divinely scornful of neglect or praise.Then Pelias, seeing this would be his son,As he had vowed, called for his wife and child.With Anaxibia, Alcestis came,A warm flush spreading o'er her eager faceIn looking on the rider of the woods,And knowing him her suitor and the king.  Admetus won Alcestis thus to wife,And these with mated hearts and mutual loveLived a life blameless, beautiful: the kingOrdaining justice in the gates; the queen,With grateful offerings to the household gods,Wise with the wisdom of the pure in heart.One child she bore,--Eumelus,--and he throve.Yet none the less because they sacrificedThe firstlings of their flocks and fruits and flowers,Did trouble come; for sickness seized the king.Alcestis watched with many-handed love,But unavailing service, for he layWith languid limbs, despite his ancient strengthOf sinew, and his skill with spear and sword.His mother came, Clymene, and with herHis father, Pheres: his unconscious childThey brought him, while forlorn Alcestis satDiscouraged, with the face of desolation.The jealous gods would bind his mouth from speech,And smite his vigorous frame with impotence;And ruin with bitter ashes, worms, and dust,The beauty of his crowned, exalted head.He knew her presence,--soon he would not know,Nor feel her hand in his lie warm and close,Nor care if she were near him any more.Exhausted with long vigils, thus the queenHeld hard and grievous thoughts, till heavy sleepPossessed her weary sense, and she dreamed.And even in her dream her trouble lived,For she was praying in a barren fieldTo all the gods for help, when came acrossThe waste of air and land, from distant skies,A spiritual voice divinely clear,Whose unimaginable sweetness thrilledHer aching heart with tremor of strange joy:"Arise, Alcestis, cast away white fear.A god dwells with you: seek, and you shall find."Then quiet satisfaction filled her soulAlmost akin to gladness, and she woke.Weak as the dead, Admetus lay there still;But she, superb with confidence, arose,And passed beyond the mourners' curious eyes,Seeking Amphryssius in the meadow-lands.She found him with the godlike mien of oneWho, roused, awakens unto deeds divine:"I come, Hyperion, with incessant tears,To crave the life of my dear lord the king.Pity me, for I see the future yearsWidowed and laden with disastrous days.And ye, the gods, will miss him when the firesUpon your shrines, unfed, neglected die.Who will pour large libations in your names,And sacrifice with generous piety?Silence and apathy will greet you thereWhere once a splendid spirit offered praise.Grant me this boon divine, and I will beatWith prayer at morning's gates, before they opeUnto thy silver-hoofed and flame-eyed steeds.Answer ere yet the irremeable streamBe crossed: answer, O god, and save!"                                   She ceased,With full throat salt with tears, and looked on him,And with a sudden cry of awe fell prone,For, lo! he was transmuted to a god;The supreme aureole radiant round his brow,Divine refulgences on his face,--his eyesAwful with splendor, and his august headWith blinding brilliance crowned by vivid flame.Then in a voice that charmed the listening air:"Woman, arise! I have no influenceOn Death, who is the servant of the Fates.Howbeit for thy passion and thy prayer,The grace of thy fair womanhood and youth,Thus godlike will I intercede for thee,And sue the insatiate sisters for this life.Yet hope not blindly: loth are these to changeTheir purpose; neither will they freely give,But haggling lend or sell: perchance the priceWill counterveil the boon.  Consider this.Now rise and look upon me."  And she rose,But by her stood no godhead bathed in light,But young Amphryssius, herdsman to the king,Benignly smiling.                    Fleet as thought, the godFled from the glittering earth to blackest depthsOf Tartarus; and none might say he spedOn wings ambrosial, or with feet as swiftAs scouring hail, or airy chariotBorne by the flame-breathing steeds ethereal;But with a motion inconceivableDeparted and was there.  Before the throneOf Ades, first he hailed the long-sought queen,Stolen with violent hands from grassy fieldsAnd delicate airs of sunlit Sicily,Pensive, gold-haired, but innocent-eyed no moreAs when she laughing plucked the daffodils,But grave as on fulfilling a strange doom.And low at Ades' feet, wrapped in grim murkAnd darkness thick, the three gray women sat,Loose-robed and chapleted with wool and flowers,Purple narcissi round their horrid hair.Intent upon her task, the first one heldThe tender thread that at a touch would snap;The second weaving it with warp and woofInto strange textures, some stained dark and foul,Some sanguine-colored, and some black as night,And rare ones white, or with a golden threadRunning throughout the web: the farthest hagWith glistening scissors cut her sisters' work.To these Hyperion, but they never ceased,Nor raised their eyes, till with soft, moderate tones,But by their powerful persuasivenessCommanding all to listen and obey,He spoke, and all hell heard, and these three lookedAnd waited his request:                             I come, a god,At pure mortal queen's request, who suesFor life renewed unto her dying lord,Admetus; and I also pray this prayer.""Then cease, for when hath Fate been moved by prayer?""But strength and upright heart should serve with you.""I ask ye not forever to forbear,But spare a while,--a moment unto us,A lifetime unto men."  "The Fates swerve notFor supplications, like the pliant gods.Have they not willed a life's thread should be cut?With them the will is changeless as the deed.O men! ye have not learned in all the past,Desires are barren and tears yield no fruit.How long will ye besiege the thrones of godsWith lamentations?  When lagged Death for allYour timorous shirking?  We work not like you,Delaying and relenting, purposeless,With unenduring issues; but our deeds,Forever interchained and interlocked,Complete each other and explain themselves.""Ye will a life: then why not any life?""What care we for the king?  He is not worthThese many words; indeed, we love not speech.We care not if he live, or lose such lifeAs men are greedy for,--filled full with hate,Sins beneath scorn, and only lit by dreams,Or one sane moment, or a useless hope,--Lasting how long?--the space between the greenAnd fading yellow of the grass they tread."But he withdrawing not: "Will any lifeSuffice ye for Admetus?"  "Yea," the cronesThree times repeated.  "We know no such namesAs king or queen or slave: we want but life.Begone, and vex us in our work no more."  With broken blessings, inarticulate joyAnd tears, Alcestis thanked Hyperion,And worshipped.  Then he gently: "Who will die,So that the king may live?"  And she: "You ask?Nay, who will live when life clasps hands with shame,And death with honor?  Lo, you are a god;You cannot know the highest joy of life,--To leave it when 't is worthier to die.His parents, kinsmen, courtiers, subjects, slaves,--For love of him myself would die, were noneFound ready; but what Greek would stand to seeA woman glorified, and falter?  Once,And only once, the gods will do this thingIn all the ages: such a man themselvesDelight to honor,--holy, temperate, chaste,With reverence for his daemon and his god."Thus she triumphant to they very doorOf King Admetus' chamber.  All there sawHer ill-timed gladness with much wonderment.But she: "No longer mourn!  The king is saved:The Fates will spare him.  Lift your voice in praise;Sing paeans to Apollo; crown your browsWith laurel; offer thankful sacrifice!""O Queen, what mean these foolish words misplaced?And what an hour is this to thank the Fates?""Thrice blessed be the gods!--for God himselfHas sued for me,--they are not stern and deaf.Cry, and they answer: commune with your soul,And they send counsel: weep with rainy grief,And these will sweeten you your bitterest tears.On one condition King Admetus lives,And ye, on hearing, will lament no more,Each emulous to save."  Then--for she spakeAssured, as having heard an oracle--They asked: "What deed of ours may serve the king?""The Fates accept another life for his,And one of you may die."  Smiling, she ceased.But silence answered her.  "What! do ye thrustYour arrows in your hearts beneath your cloaks,Dying like Greeks, too proud to own the pang?This ask I not.  In all the populous landBut one need suffer for immortal praise.The generous Fates have sent no pestilence,Famine, nor war: it is as though they gaveFreely, and only make the boon more richBy such slight payment.  Now a people mourns,And ye may change the grief to jubilee,Filling the cities with a pleasant sound.But as for me, what faltering words can tellMy joy, in extreme sharpness kin to pain?A monument you have within my heart,Wreathed with kind love and dear remembrances;And I will pray for you before I cravePardon and pity for myself from God.Your name will be the highest in the land,Oftenest, fondest on my grateful lips,After the name of him you die to save.What! silent still?  Since when has virtue grownLess beautiful than indolence and ease?Is death more terrible, more hateworthy,More bitter than dishonor?  Will ye liveOn shame?  Chew and find sweet its poisoned fruits?What sons will ye bring forth--mean-souled like you,Or, like your parents, brave--to blush like girls,And say,'Our fathers were afraid to die!'Ye will not dare to raise heroic eyesUnto the eyes of aliens.  In the streetsWill women and young children point at youScornfully, and the sun will find you shamed,And night refuse to shield you.  What a lifeIs this ye spin and fashion for yourselves!And what new tortures of suspense and doubtWill death invent for such as are afraid!Acastus, thou my brother, in the fieldForemost, who greeted me with sanguine handsFrom ruddy battle with a conqueror's face,--These honors wilt thou blot with infamy?Nay, thou hast won no honors: a mere girlWould do as much as thou at such a time,In clamorous battle,'midst tumultuous sounds,Neighing of war-steeds, shouts of sharp command,Snapping of shivered spears; for all are braveWhen all men look to them expectantly;But he is truly brave who faces deathWithin his chamber, at a sudden call,At night, when no man sees,--content to dieWhen life can serve no longer those he loves."Then thus Acastus: "Sister, I fear notDeath, nor the empty darkness of the grave,And hold my life but as a little thing,Subject unto my people's call, and Fate.But if 't is little, no greater is the king's;And though my heart bleeds sorely, I recallAstydamia, who thus would mourn for me.We are not cowards, we youth of Thessaly,And Thessaly--yea, all Greece--knoweth it;Nor will we brook the name from even you,Albeit a queen, and uttering these wild wordsThrough your umwonted sorrow."  Then she knewThat he stood firm, and turning from him, criedTo the king's parents: "Are ye deaf with grief,Pheres, Clymene?  Ye can save your son,Yet rather stand and weep with barren tears.O, shame! to think that such gray, reverend hairsShould cover such unvenerable heads!What would ye lose?--a remnant of mere life,A few slight raveled threads, and give him yearsTo fill with glory.  Who, when he is gone,Will call you gentlest names this side of heaven,--Father and mother?  Knew ye not this manEre he was royal,--a poor, helpless child,Crownless and kingdomless?  One birth aloneSufficeth not, Clymene: once againYou must give life with travail and strong pain.Has he not lived to outstrip your swift hopes?What mother can refuse a second birthTo such a son?  But ye denying him,What after-offering may appease the gods?What joy outweigh the grief of this one day?What clamor drown the hours' myriad tongues,Crying, 'Your son, your son? where is your son,Unnatural mother, timid foolish man?"Then Pheres gravely: "These are graceless wordsFrom you our daughter.  Life is always life,And death comes soon enough to such as we.We twain are old and weak, have served our time,And made our sacrifices.  Let the youngArise now in their turn and save the king.""O gods! look on your creatures! do ye see?And seeing, have ye patience?  Smite them all,Unsparing, with dishonorable death.Vile slaves! a woman teaches you to die.Intrepid, with exalted steadfast soul,Scorn in my heart, and love unutterable,I yield the Fates my life, and like a godCommand them to revere that sacred head.Thus kiss I thrice the dear, blind, holy eyes,And bid them see; and thrice I kiss this brow,And thus unfasten I the pale, proud lipsWith fruitful kissings, bringing love and life,And without fear or any pang, I breatheMy soul in him."                     "Alcestis, I awake.I hear, I hear--unspeak thy reckless words!For, lo! thy life-blood tingles in my veins,And streameth through my body like new wine.Behold! thy spirit dedicate revivesMy pulse, and through thy sacrifice I breathe.Thy lips are bloodless: kiss me not again.Ashen thy cheeks, faded thy flower-like hands.O woman! perfect in thy womanhoodAnd in thy wifehood, I adjure thee nowAs mother, by the love thou bearest our child,In this thy hour of passion and of love,Of sacrifice and sorrow, to unsayThy words sublime!"  "I die that thou mayest live.""And deemest thou that I accept the boon,Craven, like these my subjects?  Lo, my queen,Is life itself a lovely thing,--bare life?And empty breath a thing desirable?Or is it rather happiness and loveThat make it precious to its inmost core?When these are lost, are there not swords in Greece,And flame and poison, deadly waves and plagues?No man has ever lacked these things and goneUnsatisfied.  It is not these the gods refuse(Nay, never clutch my sleeve and raise thy lip),--Not these I seek; but I will stab myself,Poison my life and burn my flesh, with words,And save or follow thee.  Lo! hearken now:I bid the gods take back their loathsome gifts:O spurn them, and I scorn them, and I hate.Will they prove deaf to this as to my prayers?With tongue reviling, blasphemous, I curse,With mouth polluted from deliberate heart.Dishonored be their names, scorned be their priests,Ruined their altars, mocked their oracles!It is Admetus, King of Thessaly,Defaming thus: annihilate him, gods!So that his queen, who worships you, may live."He paused as one expectant; but no boltFrom the insulted heavens answered him,But awful silence followed.  Then a hand,A boyish hand, upon his shoulder fell,And turning, he beheld his shepherd boy,Not wrathful, but divinely pitiful,Who spake in tender, thrilling tones: "The godsCannot recall their gifts.  Blaspheme them not:Bow down and worship rather.  Shall he curseWho sees not, and who hears not,--neither knowsNor understands?  Nay, thou shalt bless and pray,--Pray, for the pure heart purged by prayer, divinesAnd seeth when the bolder eyes are blind.Worship and wonder,--these befit a manAt every hour; and mayhap will the godsYet work a miracle for knees that bendAnd hands that supplicate."                              Then all they knewA sudden sense of awe, and bowed their headsBeneath the stripling's gaze: Admetus fell,Crushed by that gentle touch, and cried aloud:"Pardon and pity! I am hard beset."          ______________________  There waited at the doorway of the kingOne grim and ghastly, shadowy, horrible,Bearing the likeness of a king himself,Erect as one who serveth not,--uponHis head a crown, within his fleshless handsA sceptre,--monstrous, winged, intolerable.To him a stranger coming 'neath the trees,Which slid down flakes of light, now on his hair,Close-curled, now on his bared and brawny chest,Now on his flexile, vine-like veined limbs,With iron network of strong muscle thewed,And godlike brows and proud mouth unrelaxed.Firm was his step; no superfluityOf indolent flesh impeded this man's strength.Slender and supple every perfect limb,Beautiful with the glory of a man.No weapons bare he, neither shield: his handsFolded upon his breast, his movements freeOf all incumbrance.  When his mighty stridesHad brought him nigh the waiting one, he paused:"Whose palace this? and who art thou, grim shade?""The palace of the King of Thessaly,And my name is not strange unto thine ears;For who hath told men that I wait for them,The one sure thing on earth?  Yet all they know,Unasking and yet answered.  I am Death,The only secret that the gods reveal.But who are thou who darest question me?""Alcides; and that thing I dare not doHath found no name.  Whom here awaitest thou?""Alcestis, Queen of Thessaly,--a queenWho wooed me as the bridegroom woos the bride,For her life sacrificed will save her lordAdmetus, as the Fates decreed.  I waitImpatient, eager; and I enter soon,With darkening wing, invisible, a god,And kiss her lips, and kiss her throbbing heart,And then the tenderest hands can do no moreThan close her eyes and wipe her cold, white brow,Inurn her ashes and strew flowers above.""This woman is a god, a hero, Death.In this her sacrifice I see a soulLuminous, starry: earth can spare her not:It is not rich enough in purityTo lose this paragon.  Save her, O Death!Thou surely art more gentle than the Fates,Yet these have spared her lord, and never meantThat she should suffer, and that this their grace,Beautiful, royal on one side, should turnSudden and show a fearful, fatal face.""Nay, have they not?  O fond and foolish man,Naught comes unlooked for, unforeseen by them.Doubt when they favor thee, though thou mayest laughWhen they have scourged thee with an iron scourge.Behold, their smile is deadlier than their sting,And every boon of theirs is double-faced.Yea, I am gentler unto ye than these:I slay relentless, but when have I mockedWith poisoned gifts, and generous hands that smiteUnder the flowers? for my name is Truth.Were this fair queen more fair, more pure, more chaste,I would not spare her for your wildest prayerNor her best virtue.  Is the earth's mouth full?Is the grave satisfied?  Discrown me then,For life is lord, and men may mock the godsWith immortality."  "I sue no more,But I command thee spare this woman's life,Or wrestle with Alcides."  "Wrestle with thee,Thou puny boy!"  And Death laughed loud, and swelledTo monstrous bulk, fierce-eyed, with outstretched wings,And lightnings round his brow; but grave and firm,Strong as a tower, Alcides waited him,And these began to wrestle, and a cloudImpenetrable fell, and all was dark.         ______________________  "Farewell, Admetus and my little son,Eumelus,--O these clinging baby hands!Thy loss is bitter, for no chance, no fame,No wealth of love, can ever compensatefor a dead mother.  Thou, O king, fulfillThe double duty: love him with my love,And make him bold to wrestle, shiver spears,Noble and manly, Grecian to the bone;And tell him that his mother spake with gods.Farewell, farewell!  Mine eyes are growing blind:The darkness gathers.  O my heart, my heart!"No sound made answer save the cries of griefFrom all the mourners, and the supplianceOf strick'n Admetus: "O have mercy, gods!O gods, have mercy, mercy upon us!"Then from the dying woman's couch againHer voice was heard, but with strange sudden tones:"Lo, I awake--the light comes back to me.What miracle is this?"  And thunders shookThe air, and clouds of mighty darkness fell,And the earth trembled, and weird, horrid soundsWere heard of rushing wings and fleeing feet,And groans; and all were silent, dumb with awe,Saving the king, who paused not in his prayer:"Have mercy, gods!" and then again, "O gods,Have mercy!"              Through the open casement pouredBright floods of sunny light; the air was soft,Clear, delicate as though a summer stormHad passed away; and those there standing saw,Afar upon the plain, Death fleeing thence,And at the doorway, weary, well-nigh spent,Alcides, flushed with victory.               TANNHAUSER.         To my mother.  May, 1870.The Landgrave Hermann held a gatheringOf minstrels, minnesingers, troubadours,At Wartburg in his palace, and the knight,Sir Tannhauser of France, the greatest bard,Inspired with heavenly visions, and endowedWith apprehension and rare utteranceOf noble music, fared in thoughtful wiseAcross the Horsel meadows.  Full of light,And large repose, the peaceful valley lay,In the late splendor of the afternoon,And level sunbeams lit the serious faceOf the young knight, who journeyed to the west,Towards the precipitous and rugged cliffs,Scarred, grim, and torn with savage rifts and chasms,That in the distance loomed as soft and fairAnd purple as their shadows on the grass.The tinkling chimes ran out athwart the air,Proclaiming sunset, ushering evening in,Although the sky yet glowed with yellow light.The ploughboy, ere he led his cattle home,In the near meadow, reverently knelt,And doffed his cap, and duly crossed his breast,Whispering his "Ave Mary," as he heardThe pealing vesper-bell.  But still the knight,Unmindful of the sacred hour announced,Disdainful or unconscious, held his course."Would that I also, like yon stupid wight,Could kneel and hail the Virgin and believe!"He murmured bitterly beneath his breath."Were I a pagan, riding to contendFor the Olympic wreath, O with what zeal,What fire of inspiration, would I singThe praises of the gods!  How may my lyreGlorify these whose very life I doubt?The world is governed by one cruel God,Who brings a sword, not peace.  A pallid Christ,Unnatural, perfect, and a virgin cold,They give us for a heaven of living gods,Beautiful, loving, whose mere names were song;A creed of suffering and despair, walled inOn every side by brazen boundaries,That limit the soul's vision and her hopeTo a red hell or and unpeopled heaven.Yea, I am lost already,--even nowAm doomed to flaming torture for my thoughts.O gods! O gods! where shall my soul find peace?"He raised his wan face to the faded skies,Now shadowing into twilight; no responseCame from their sunless heights; no miracle,As in the ancient days of answering gods.With a long, shuddering sigh he glanced to earth,Finding himself among the Horsel cliffs.Gray, sullen, gaunt, they towered on either side;Scant shrubs sucked meagre life between the riftsOf their huge crags, and made small darker spotsUpon their wrinkled sides; the jaded horseStumbled upon loose, rattling, fallen stones,Amidst the gathering dusk, and blindly faredThrough the weird, perilous pass.  As darkness waxed,And an oppressive mystery enwrappedThe roadstead and the rocks, Sir TannhauserFancied he saw upon the mountain-sideThe fluttering of white raiment.  With a senseOf wild joy and horror, he gave pause,For his sagacious horse that reeked of sweat,Trembling in every limb, confirmed his thought,That nothing human scaled that haunted cliff.The white thing seemed descending,--now a cloudIt looked, and now a rag of drifted mist,Torn in the jagged gorge precipitous,And now an apparition clad in white,Shapely and real,--then he lost it quite,Gazing on nothing with blank, foolish face.As with wide eyes he stood, he was awareOf a strange splendor at his very side,A presence and a majesty so great,That ere he saw, he felt it was divine.He turned, and, leaping from his horse, fell prone,In speechless adoration, on the earth,Before the matchless goddess, who appearedWith no less freshness of immortal youthThan when first risen from foam of Paphian seas.He heard delicious strains of melody,Such as his highest muse had ne'er attained,Float in the air, while in the distance rang,Harsh and discordant, jarring with those tones,The gallop of his frightened horse's hoofs,Clattering in sudden freedom down the pass.A voice that made all music dissonanceThen thrilled through heart and flesh of that prone knight,Triumphantly: "The gods need but appear,And their usurped thrones are theirs again!"Then tenderly: "Sweet knight, I pray thee, rise;Worship me not, for I desire thy love.Look on me, follow me, for I am fainOf thy fair, human face."  He rose and looked,Stirred by that heavenly flattery to the soul.Her hair, unbraided and unfilleted,Rained in a glittering shower to the ground,And cast forth lustre.  Round her zone was claspedThe scintillant cestus, stiff with flaming gold,Thicker with restless gems than heaven with stars.She might have flung the enchanted wonder forth;Her eyes, her slightest gesture would sufficeTo bind all men in blissful slavery.She sprang upon the mountain's dangerous side,With feet that left their print in flowers divine,--Flushed amaryllis and blue hyacinth,Impurpled amaranth and asphodel,Dewy with nectar, and exhaling scentsRicher than all the roses of mid-June.The knight sped after her, with wild eyes fixedUpon her brightness, as she lightly leaptFrom crag to crag, with flying auburn hair,Like a gold cloud, that lured him ever on,Higher and higher up the haunted cliff.At last amidst a grove of pines she paused,Until he reached her, breathing hard with haste,Delight, and wonder.  Then upon his handShe placed her own, and all his blood at onceTingled and hotly rushed to brow and cheek,At the supreme caress; but the mere touchInfused fresh life, and when she looked at himWith gracious tenderness, he felt himselfStrong suddenly to bear the blinding lightOf those great eyes.  "Dear knight," she murmured low,"For love of me, wilt thou accord this boon,--To grace my weary home in banishment?"His hungry eyes gave answer ere he spoke,In tones abrupt that startled his own earsWith their strange harshness; but with thanks profuseShe guided him, still holding his cold handIn her warm, dainty palm, unto a cave,Whence a rare glory issued, and a smellOf spice and roses, frankincense and balm.They entering stood within a marble hall,With straight, slim pillars, at whose farther endThe goddess led him to a spiral flightOf stairs, descending always 'midst black gloomInto the very bowels of the earth.Down these, with fearful swiftness, they made way,The knight's feet touching not the solid stair,But sliding down as in a vexing dream,Blind, feeling but that hand divine that stillEmpowered him to walk on empty air.Then he was dazzled by a sudden blaze,In vast palace filled with reveling folk.Cunningly pictured on the ivory wallsWere rolling hills, cool lakes, and boscage green,And all the summer landscape's various pomp.The precious canopy aloft was carvedIn semblance of the pleached forest trees,Enameled with the liveliest green, wherethroughA light pierced, more resplendent than the day.O'er the pale, polished jasper of the floorOf burnished metal, fretted and embossedWith all the marvelous story of her birthPainted in prodigal splendor of rich tincts,And carved by heavenly artists,--crystal seas,And long-haired Nereids in their pearly shells,And all the wonder of her lucent limbsSphered in a vermeil mist.  Upon the throneShe took her seat, the knight beside her still,Singing on couches of fresh asphodel,And the dance ceased, and the flushed revelers cameIn glittering phalanx to adore their queen.Beautiful girls, with shining delicate heads,Crested with living jewels, fanned the airWith flickering wings from naked shoulders soft.Then with preluding low, a thousand harps,And citherns, and strange nameless instruments,Sent through the fragrant air sweet symphonies,And the winged dancers waved in mazy rounds,With changing lustres like a summer sea.Fair boys, with charming yellow hair crisp-curled,And frail, effeminate beauty, the knight saw,But of strong, stalwart men like him were none.He gazed thereon bewitched, until the handOf Venus, erst withdrawn, now fell againUpon his own, and roused him from his trance.He looked on her, and as he looked, a cloudAuroral, flaming as at sunrising,Arose from nothing, floating over themIn luminous folds, like that vermilion mistPenciled upon the throne, and as it waxedIn density and brightness, all the throngOf festal dancers, less and less distinct,Grew like pale spirits in a vague, dim dream,And vanished altogether; and these twain,Shut from the world in that ambrosial cloud,Now with a glory inconceivable,Vivid and conflagrant, looked each on each.  All hours came laden with their own delightsIn that enchanted place, wherein TimeKnew no divisions harsh of night and day,But light was always, and desire of sleepWas satisfied at once with slumber soft,Desire of food with magical repast,By unseen hands on golden tables spread.But these the knight accepted like a god,All less was lost in that excess of joy,The crowning marvel of her love for him,Assuring him of his divinity.Meanwhile remembrance of the earth appearedLike the vague trouble of a transient dream,--The doubt, the scruples, the remorse for thoughtsBeyond his own control, the constant thirstFor something fairer than his life, more realThan airy revelations of his Muse.Here was his soul's desire satisfied.All nobler passions died; his lyre he flungRecklessly forth, with vows to dedicateHis being to herself.  She knew and seizedThe moment of her mastery, and conveyedThe lyre beyond his sight and memory.With blandishment divine she changed for him,Each hour, her mood; a very woman now,Fantastic, voluble, affectionate,And jealous of the vague, unbodied air,Exacting, penitent, and pacified,All in a breath.  And often she appearedMajestic with celestial wrath, with eyesThat shot forth fire, and a heavy brow,Portentous as the lowering front of heaven,When the reverberant, sullen thunder rollsAmong the echoing clouds.  Thus she denouncedHer ancient, fickle worshippers, who leftHer altars desecrate, her fires unfed,Her name forgotten.  "But I reign, I reign!"She would shrill forth, triumphant; "yea, I reign.Men name me not, but worship me unnamed,Beauty and Love within their heart of hearts;Not with bent knees and empty breath of words,But with devoted sacrifice of lives."Then melting in a moment, she would weepAmbrosial tears, pathetic, full of guile,Accusing her own base ingratitude,In craving worship, when she had his heart,Her priceless knight, her peerless paladin,Her Tannhauser; then, with an artful glanceOf lovely helplessness, entreated himNot to desert her, like the faithless world,For these unbeautiful and barbarous gods,Or she would never cease her prayers to Jove,Until he took from her the heavy curseOf immortality.  With closer vows,The knight then sealed his worship and forsworeAll other aims and deeds to serve her cause.Thus passed unnoted seven barren yearsOf reckless passion and voluptuous sloth,Undignified by any lofty thoughtIn his degraded mind, that sometime wasEndowed with noble capability.From revelry to revelry he passed,Craving more pungent pleasure momently,And new intoxications, and each hourThe siren goddess answered his desires.Once when she left him with a weary senseOf utter lassitude, he sat alone,And, raising listless eyes, he saw himselfIn a great burnished mirror, wrought aboutWith cunning imagery of twisted vines.He scarcely knew those sunken, red-rimmed eyes,For his who in the flush of manhood rodeAmong the cliffs, and followed up the cragsThe flying temptress; and there fell on himA horror of her beauty, a disgustFor his degenerate and corrupted life,With irresistible, intense desire,To feel the breath of heaven on his face.Then as Fate willed, who rules above the gods,He saw, within the glass, behind him glideThe form of Venus.  Certain of her power,She had laid by, in fond security,The enchanted cestus, and Sir Tannhauser,With surfeited regard, beheld her now,No fairer than the women of the earth,Whom with serenity and health he left,Duped by a lovely witch.  Before he moved,She knew her destiny; and when he turned,He seemed to drop a mask, disclosing thusAn alien face, and eyes with vision true,That for long time with glamour had been blind.Hiding the hideous rage within her breast,With girlish simpleness of folded hands,Auroral blushes, and sweet, shamefast mien,She spoke: "Behold, my love, I have cast forthAll magic, blandishments and sorcery,For I have dreamed a dream so terrible,That I awoke to find my pillow stainedWith tears as of real woe.  I thought my belt,By Vulcan wrought with matchless skill and power,Was the sole bond between us; this being doffed,I seemed to thee an old, unlovely crone,Wrinkled by every year that I have seen.Thou turnedst from me with a brutal sneer,So that I woke with weeping.  Then I rose,And drew the glittering girdle from my zone,Jealous thereof, yet full of fears, and said,'If it be this he loves, then let him go!I have no solace as a mortal hath,No hope of change or death to comfort meThrough all eternity; yet he is free,Though I could hold him fast with heavy chains,Bound in perpetual imprisonment.'Tell me my vision was a baseless dream;See, I am kneeling, and kiss thy hands,--In pity, look on me, before thy wordCondemns me to immortal misery!"As she looked down, the infernal influenceWorked on his soul again; for she was fairBeyond imagination, and her browSeemed luminous with high self-sacrifice.He bent and kissed her head, warm, shining, soft,With its close-curling gold, and love revived.But ere he spoke, he heard the distant soundOf one sweet, smitten lyre, and a gleamOf violent anger flashed across the faceUpraised to his in feigned simplicityAnd singleness of purpose.  Then he sprang,Well-nigh a god himself, with sudden strengthto vanquish and resist, beyond her reach,Crying, "My old Muse calls me, and I hear!Thy fateful vision is no baseless dream;I will be gone from this accursed hall!"Then she, too, rose, dilating over him,And sullen clouds veiled all her rosy limbs,Unto her girdle, and her head appearedRefulgent, and her voice rang wrathfully:"Have I cajoled and flattered thee till now,To lose thee thus!  How wilt thou make escape?ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:Yea, not my love, but my poor slave and fool."But he, with both hands pressed upon his eyes,Against that blinding lustre, heeded notHer thundered words, and cried in sharp despair,"Help me, O Virgin Mary! and thereat,The very bases of the hall gave way,The roof was rived, the goddess disappeared,And Tannhauser stood free upon the cliff,Amidst the morning sunshine and fresh air.  Around him were the tumbled blocks and crags,Huge ridges and sharp juts of flinty peaks,Black caves, and masses of the grim, bald rock.The ethereal, unfathomable sky,Hung over him, the valley lay beneath,Dotted with yellow hayricks, that exhaledSweet, healthy odors to the mountain-top.He breathed intoxicate the infinite air,And plucked the heather blossoms where they blew,Reckless with light and dew, in crannies green,And scarcely saw their darling bells for tears.No sounds of labor reached him from the farmsAnd hamlets trim, nor from the furrowed glebe;But a serene and sabbath stillness reigned,Till broken by the faint, melodious chimesOf the small village church that called to prayer.He hurried down the rugged, scarped cliff,And swung himself from shelving granite slopesTo narrow foot-holds, near wide-throated chasms,Tearing against the sharp stones his bleeding hands,With long hair flying from his dripping brow,Uncovered head, and white, exalted face.No memory had he of his smooth ascent,No thought of fear upon those dreadful hills;He only heard the bell, inviting himTo satisfy the craving of his heart,For worship 'midst his fellow men.  He reachedThe beaten, dusty road, and passed thereonThe pious peasants faring towards the church,And scarce refrained from greeting them like friendsDearly beloved, after long absence met.How more than fair the sunburnt wenches looked,In their rough, homespun gowns and coifs demure,After the beauty of bare, rosy limbs,And odorous, loose hair!  He noted notSuspicious glances on his garb uncouth,His air extravagant and face distraught,With bursts of laughter from the red-cheeked boys,And prudent crossings of the women's breasts.He passed the flowering close about the church,And trod the well worn-path, with throbbing heart,The little heather-bell between his lips,And his eyes fastened on the good green grass.Thus entered he the sanctuary, litWith frequent tapers, and with sunbeams stainedThrough painted glass.  How pure and innocentThe waiting congregation seemed to him,Kneeling, or seated with calm brows upraised!With faltering strength, he cowered down alone,And held sincere communion with the Lord,For one brief moment, in a sudden gushOf blessed tears.  The minister of GodRose to invoke a blessing on his flock,And then began the service,--not in wordsTo raise the lowly, and to heal the sick,But an alien tongue, with phrases formed,And meaningless observances.  The knight,Unmoved, yet thirsting for the simple wordThat might have moved him, held his bitter thoughts,But when in his own speech a new priest spake,Looked up with hope revived, and heard the text:"Go, preach the Gospel unto all the world.He that believes and is baptized, is saved.He that believeth not, is damned in hell!"He sat with neck thrust forth and staring eyes;The crowded congregation disappeared;He felt alone in some black sea of hell,While a great light smote one exalted face,Vivid already with prophetic fire,Whose fatal mouth now thundered forth his doom.He longed in that void circle to cry out,With one clear shriek, but sense and voice seemed bound,And his parched tongue clave useless to his mouth.As the last words resounded through the church,And once again the pastor blessed his flock,Who, serious and subdued, passed slowly downThe arrow aisle, none noted, near the wall,A fallen man with face upon his knees,A heap of huddled garments and loose hair,Unconscious 'mid the rustling, murmurous stir,'Midst light and rural smell of grass and flowers,Let in athwart the doorway.  One lone priest,Darkening the altar lights, moved noiselessly,Now with the yellow glow upon his face,Now a black shadow gliding farther on,Amidst the smooth, slim pillars of hewn ash.But from the vacant aisles he heard at onceA hollow sigh, heaved from a depth profound.Upholding his last light above his head,And peering eagerly amidst the stalls,He cried, "Be blest who cometh in God's name."Then the gaunt form of Tannhauser arose."Father, I am a sinner, and I seekForgiveness and help, by whatso meansI can regain the joy of peace with God.""The Lord hath mercy on the penitent.'Although thy sins be scarlet,' He hath said,'Will I not make them white as wool?'  Confess,And I will shrive you."  Thus the good priest movedTowards the remorseful knight and pressed his hand.But shrinking down, he drew his fingers backFrom the kind palm, and kissed the friar's feet."Thy pure hand is anointed, and can heal.The cool, calm pressure brings back sanity,And what serene, past joys! yet touch me not,My contact is pollution,--hear, O hear,While I disburden my charged soul."  He lay,Casting about for words and strength to speak."O father, is there help for such a one,"In tones of deep abasement he began,"Who hath rebelled against the laws of God,With pride no less presumptuous than hisWho lost thereby his rank in heaven?"  "My son,There is atonement for all sins,--or slightOr difficult, proportioned to the crime.Though this may be the staining of thy handsWith blood of kinsmen or of fellow-men.""My hands are white,--my crime hath found no name,This side of hell; yet though my heart-strings snapTo live it over, let me make the attempt.I was a knight and bard, with such a giftOf revelation that no hour of lifeLacked beauty and adornment, in myselfThe seat and centre of all happiness.What inspiration could my lofty MuseDraw from those common and familiar themes,Painted upon the windows and the wallsOf every church,--the mother and her child,The miracle and mystery of the birth,The death, the resurrection?  Fool and blind!That saw not symbols of eternal truthIn that grand tragedy and victory,Significant and infinite as life.What tortures did my skeptic soul endure,At war against herself and all mankind!The restless nights of feverish sleeplessness,With balancing of reasons nicely weighed;The dawn that brought no hope nor energy,The blasphemous arraignment of the Lord,Taxing His glorious divinityWith all the grief and folly of the world.Then came relapses into abject fear,And hollow prayer and praise from craven heart.Before a sculptured Venus I would kneel,Crown her with flowers, worship her, and cry,'O large and noble type of our ideal,At least my heart and prayer return to thee,Amidst a faithless world of proselytes.Madonna Mary, with her virgin lips,And eyes that look perpetual reproach,Insults and is a blasphemy on youth.Is she to claim the worship of a manHot with the first rich flush of ripened life?'Realities, like phantoms, glided by,Unnoted 'midst the torment and delightsOf my conflicting spirit, and I doffedthe modest Christian weeds of charityAnd fit humility, and steeled myselfIn pagan panoply of stoicismAnd self-sufficing pride.  Yet constantlyI gained men's charmed attention and applause,With the wild strains I smote from out my lyre,To me the native language of my soul,To them attractive and miraculous,As all things whose solution and whose sourceRemain a mystery.  Then came suddenlyThe summons to attend the gatheringOf minstrels at the Landgrave Hermann's court.Resolved to publish there my pagan creedIn harmonies so high and beautifulThat all the world would share my zeal and faith,I journeyed towards the haunted Horsel cliffs.O God! how may I tell you how SHE came,The temptress of a hundred centuries,Yet fresh as April?  She bewitched my sense,Poisoned my judgment with sweet flatteries,And for I may not guess how many yearsHeld me a captive in degrading bonds.There is no sin of lust so lewd and foul,Which I learned not in that alluring hell,Until this morn, I snapped the ignoble tie,By calling on the Mother of our Lord.O for the power to stand again erect,And look men in the eyes!  What penitence,What scourging of the flesh, what rigid fasts,What terrible privations may sufficeTo cleanse me in the sight of God and man?"Ill-omened silence followed his appeal.Patient and motionless he lay awhile,Then sprang unto his feet with sudden force,Confronting in his breathless vehemence,With palpitating heart, the timid priest."Answer me, as you hope for a response,One day, at the great judgment seat yourself.""I cannot answer," said the timid priest,"I have not understood."  "Just God! is thisThe curse Thou layest upon me?  I outstripThe sympathy and brotherhood of men,So far removed is my experienceFrom their clean innocence.  Inspire me,Prompt me to words that bring me near to them!Father," in gentler accents he resumed,"Thank Heaven at your every orisonThat sin like mine you cannot apprehend.More than the truth perchance I have confessed,But I have sinned, and darkly,--this is true;And I have suffered, and am suffering now.Is there no help in your great Christian creedOf liberal charity, for such a one?""My son," the priest replied, "your speech distraughtHath quite bewildered me.  I fain would hopeThat Christ's large charity can reach your sin,But I know naught.  I cannot but believeThat the enchantress who first tempted youMust be the Evil one,--your early doubtWas the possession of your soul by him.Travel across the mountain to the town,The first cathedral town upon the roadThat leads to Rome,--a sage and reverend priest,The Bishop Adrian, bides there.  Say you have comeFrom his leal servant, Friar Lodovick;He hath vast lore and great authority,And may absolve you freely of your sin."  Over the rolling hills, through summer fields,By noisy villages and lonely lanes,Through glowing days, when all the landscape stretchedShimmering in the heat, a pilgrim faredTowards the cathedral town.  Sir TannhauserHad donned the mournful sackcloth, girt his loinsWith a coarse rope that ate into his flesh,Muffled a cowl about his shaven head,Hung a great leaden cross around his neck;And bearing in his hands a knotty staff,With swollen, sandaled feet he held his course.He snatched scant rest at twilight or at dawn,When his forced travel was least difficult.But most he journeyed when the sky, o'ercast,Uprolled its threatening clouds of dusky blue,And angry thunder grumbled through the hills,And earth grew dark at noonday, till the flashOf the thin lightning through the wide sky leapt.And tumbling showers scoured along the plain.Then folk who saw the pilgrim penitent,Drenched, weird, and hastening as as to some strange doom,Swore that the wandering Jew had crossed their land,And the Lord Christ had sent the deadly boltHarmless upon his cursed, immortal head.At length the hill-side city's spires and roofs,With all its western windows smitten redBy a rich sunset, and with massive towersOf its cathedral overtopping all,greeted his sight.  Some weary paces more,And as the twilight deepened in the streets,He stood within the minster.  How serene,In sculptured calm of centuries, it seemed!How cool and spacious all the dim-lit aisles,Still hazy with fumes of frankincense!The vesper had been said, yet here and thereA wrinkled beldam, or mourner veiled,Or burly burgher on the cold floor knelt,And still the organist, with wandering hands,Drew from the keys mysterious melodies,And filled the church with flying waifs of song,That with ethereal beauty moved the soulTo a more tender prayer and gentler faithThan choral anthems and the solemn mass.A thousand memories, sweet to bitterness,Rushed on the knight and filled his eyes with tears;Youth's blamelessness and faith forever lost,The love of his neglected lyre, his art,Revived by these aerial harmonies.He was unworthy now to touch the strings,Too base to stir men's soul to ecstasyAnd high resolves, as in the days agone;And yet, with all his spirit's earnestness,He yearned to feel the lyre between his hands,To utter all the trouble of his lifeUnto the Muse who understands and helps.Outworn with travel, soothed to drowsinessBy dying music and sweet-scented air,His limbs relaxed, and sleep possessed his frame.Auroral light the eastern oriels touched,When with delicious sense of rest he woke,Amidst the cast and silent empty aisles."God's peace hath fallen upon me in this place;This is my Bethel; here I feel againA holy calm, if not of innocence,Yet purest after that, the calm sereneOf expiation and forgiveness."He spake, and passed with staff and wallet forthThrough the tall portal to the open square,And turning, paused to look upon the pile.The northern front against the crystal skyLoomed dark and heavy, full of sombre shade,With each projecting buttress, carven cross,Gable and mullion, tipped with laughing lightBy the slant sunbeams of the risen morn.The noisy swallows wheeled above their nests,Builded in hidden nooks about the porch.No human life was stirring in the square,Save now and then a rumbling market-team,Fresh from the fields and farms without the town.He knelt upon the broad cathedral steps,And kissed the moistened stone, while overheadThe circling swallows sang, and all aroundThe mighty city lay asleep and still.  To stranger's ears must yet again be madeThe terrible confession; yet againA deathly chill, with something worse than fear,Seized the knight's heart, who knew his every wordWidened the gulf between his kind and him.The Bishop sat with pomp of mitred head,In pride of proven virtue, hearkening to allWith cold, official apathy, nor madeA sign of pity nor encouragement.The friar understood the pilgrim's grief,The language of his eyes; his speech aloneWas alien to these kind, untutored ears.But this was truly to be misconstrued,To tear each palpitating word aliveFrom out the depths of his remorseful soul,And have it weighed with the precision coolAnd the nice logic of a reasoning mind.This spiritual Father judged his crimeAs the mad mischief of a reckless boy,That call for strict, immediate punishment.But Tannhauser, who felt himself a man,Though base, yet fallen through passions and rare giftsOf an exuberant nature rankly rich,And knew his weary head was growing grayWith a life's terrible experience,Found his old sense of proper worth revive;But modestly he ended: "Yet I felt,O holy Father, in the church, this morn,A strange security, a peace serene,As though e'en yet the Lord regarded meWith merciful compassion; yea, as thoughEven so vile a worm as I might workMine own salvation, through repentant prayers.""Presumptuous man, it is no easy taskTo expiate such sin; a space of prayerThat deprecates the anger of the Lord,A pilgrimage through pleasant summer lands,May not atone for years of impious lust;Thy heart hath lied to thee in offering hope.""Is there no hope on earth?" the pilgrim sighed."None through thy penance," said the saintly man."Yet there may be through mediation, help.There is a man who by a blameless lifeHath won the right to intercede with God.No sins of his own flesh hath he to purge,--The Cardinal Filippo,--he abides,Within the Holy City.  Seek him out;This is my only counsel,--through thyselfCan be no help and no forgiveness."  How different from the buoyant joy of mornWas this discouraged sense of lassitude,The Bishop's words were ringing in his ears,Measured and pitiless, and blent with these,The memory of the goddess' last wild cry,--"ONCE BEING MINE, THOU ART FOREVER MINE."Was it the truth, despite his penitence,And the dedication of his thought to God,That still some portion of himself was hers,Some lust survived, some criminal regret,For her corrupted love?  He searched his heart:All was remorse, religious and sincere,And yet her dreadful curse still haunted him;For all men shunned him, and denied him help,Knowing at once in looking on his face,Ploughed with deep lines and prematurely old,That he had struggled with some deadly fiend,And that he was no longer kin to them.Just past the outskirts of the town, he stopped,To strengthen will and courage to proceed.The storm had broken o'er the sultry streets,But now the lessening clouds were flying east,And though the gentle shower still wet his face,The west was cloudless while the sun went down,And the bright seven-colored arch stood forth,Against the opposite dull gray.  There wasA beauty in the mingled storm and peace,Beyond clear sunshine, as the vast, green fieldsBasked in soft light, though glistening yet with rain.The roar of all the town was now a buzzLess than the insects' drowsy murmuringThat whirred their gauzy wings around his head.The breeze that follows on the sunsettingWas blowing whiffs of bruised and dripping grassInto the heated city.  But he stood,Disconsolate with thoughts of fate and sin,Still wrestling with his soul to win it backFrom her who claimed it to eternity.Then on the delicate air there came to himThe intonation of the minster bells,Chiming the vespers, musical and faint.He knew not what of dear and beautifulThere was in those familiar peals, that spakeOf his first boyhood and his innocence,Leading him back, with gracious influence,To pleasant thoughts and tender memories,And last, recalling the fair hour of hopeHe passed that morning in the church.  Again,The glad assurance of God's boundless loveFilled all his being, and he rose serene,And journeyed forward with a calm content.  Southward he wended, and the landscape tookA warmer tone, the sky a richer light.The gardens of the graceful, festooned with hops,With their slight tendrils binding pole to pole,Gave place to orchards and the trellised grape,The hedges were enwreathed with trailing vines,With clustering, shapely bunches, 'midst the growthOf tangled greenery.  The elm and ashLess frequent grew than cactus, cypresses,And golden-fruited or large-blossomed trees.The far hills took the hue of the dove's breast,Veiled in gray mist of olive groves.  No moreHe passed dark, moated strongholds of grim knights,But terraces with marble-paven steps,With fountains leaping in the sunny air,And hanging gardens full of sumptuous bloom.Then cloisters guarded by their dead gray walls,Where now and then a golden globe of fruitOr full-flushed flower peered out upon the road,Nodding against the stone, and where he heardSometimes the voices of the chanting monks,Sometimes the laugh of children at their play,Amidst the quaint, old gardens.  But these sightsWere in the suburbs of the wealthy towns.For many a day through wildernesses rank,Or marshy, feverous meadow-lands he fared,The fierce sun smiting his close-muffled head;Or 'midst the Alpine gorges faced the storm,That drave adown the gullies melted snowAnd clattering boulders from the mountain-tops.At times, between the mountains and the seaFair prospects opened, with the boundless stretchOf restless, tideless water by his side,And their long wash upon the yellow sand.Beneath this generous sky the country-folkCould lead a freer life,--the fat, green fieldsOffered rich pasturage, athwart the airRang tinkling cow-bells and the shepherds' pipes.The knight met many a strolling troubadour,Bearing his cithern, flute, or dulcimer;And oft beneath some castle's balcony,At night, he heard their mellow voices rise,Blent with stringed instruments or tambourines,Chanting some lay as natural as a bird's.Then Nature stole with healthy influenceInto his thoughts; his love of beauty woke,His Muse inspired dreams as in the past.But after this came crueler remorse,And he would tighten round his loins the rope,And lie for hours beside some wayside cross,And feel himself unworthy to enjoyThe splendid gift and privilege of life.Then forth he hurried, spurred by his desireTo reach the City of the Seven Hills,And gain his absolution.  Some leagues moreWould bring him to the vast Campagna land,When by a roadside well he paused to rest.'T was noon, and reapers in the field hard byLay neath the trees upon the sun-scorched grass.But from their midst one came towards the well,Not trudging like a man forespent with toil,But frisking like a child at holiday,With light steps.  The pilgrim watched him come,And found him scarcely older than a child,A large-mouthed earthen pitcher in his hand,And a guitar upon his shoulder slung.A wide straw hat threw all his face in shade,But doffing this, to catch whatever breezeMight stir among the branches, he disclosedA charming head of rippled, auburn hair,A frank, fair face, as lovely as a girls,With great, soft eyes, as mild and grave as kine's.Above his head he slipped the instrument,And laid it with his hat upon the turf,Lowered his pitcher down the well-head cool,And drew it dripping upward, ere he sawThe watchful pilgrim, craving (as he thought)The precious draught.  "Your pardon, holy sir,Drink first," he cried, "before I take the jarUnto my father in the reaping-field."Touched by the cordial kindness of the lad,The pilgrim answered,--"Thanks, my thirst is quenchedFrom mine own palm."  The stranger deftly poisedThe brimming pitcher on his head, and turnedBack to the reaping-folk, while TannhauserLooked after him across the sunny fields,Clasping each hand about his waist to bearThe balanced pitcher; then, down glancing, foundThe lad's guitar near by, and fell at onceTo striking its tuned string with wandering hands,And pensive eyes filled full of tender dreams."Yea, holy sir, it is a worthless thing,And yet I love it, for I make it speak."The boy again stood by him and dispelledHis train of fantasies half sweet, half sad."That was not in my thought," the knight replied."Its worth is more than rubies; whoso hathThe art to make this speak is raised therebyAbove all loneliness or grief or fear."More to himself than to the lad he spake,Who, understanding not, stood doubtfullyAt a loss for answer; but the knight went on:"How came it in your hands, and who hath tunedyour voice to follow it."  "I am unskilled,Good father, but my mother smote its stringsTo music rare."  Diverted from one theme,Pleased with the winsome candor of the boy,The knight encouraged him to confidence;Then his own gift of minstrelsy revealed,And told bright tales of his first wanderings,When in lords' castles and kings' palacesMen still made place for him, for in his landThe gift was rare and valued at its worth,And brought great victory and sounding fame.Thus, in retracing all his pleasant youth,His suffering passed as though it had not been.Wide-eyed and open-mouthed the boy gave ear,His fair face flushing with the sudden thoughtsThat went and came,--then, as the pilgrim ceased,Drew breath and spake: "And where now is your lyre?"The knight with both hands hid his changed, white face,Crying aloud, "Lost! lost! forever lost!"Then, gathering strength, he bared his face againUnto the frightened, wondering boy, and roseWith hasty fear.  "Ah, child, you bring me backUnwitting to remembrance of my grief,For which I donned eternal garb of woe;And yet I owe you thanks for one sweet hourOf healthy human intercourse and peace.'T is not for me to tarry by the way.Farewell!"  The impetuous, remorseful boy,Seeing sharp pain on that kind countenance,Fell at his feet and cried, "Forgive my words,Witless but innocent, and leave me notWithout a blessing."  Moved unutterably,The pilgrim kissed with trembling lips his head,And muttered, "At this moment would to GodThat I were worthy!"  Then waved wasted handsOver the youth in act of blessing him,But faltered, "Cleanse me through his innocence,O heavenly Father!" and with quickening stepsHastened away upon the road to Rome.The noon was past, the reapers drew broad swathsWith scythes sun-smitten 'midst the ripened crop.Thin shadows of the afternoon slept softOn the green meadows as the knight passed forth.  He trudged amidst the sea of poisonous flowersOn the Campagna's undulating plain,With Rome, the many-steepled, many-towered,Before him regnant on her throne of hills.A thick blue cloud of haze o'erhung the town,But the fast-sinking sun struck fiery lightFrom shining crosses, roofs, and flashing domes.Across his path an arching bridge of stoneWas raised above a shrunken yellow stream,Hurrying with the light on every waveTowards the great town and outward to the sea.Upon the bridge's crest he paused, and leanedAgainst the barrier, throwing back his cowl,And gazed upon the dull, unlovely floodThat was the Tiber.  Quaggy banks lay bare,Muddy and miry, glittering in the sun,And myriad insects hovered o'er the reeds,Whose lithe, moist tips by listless airs were stirred.When the low sun had dropped behind the hills,He found himself within the streets of Rome,Walking as in a sleep, where naught seemed real.The chattering hubbub of the market-placeWas over now; but voices smote his earOf garrulous citizens who jostled past.Loud cries, gay laughter, snatches of sweet song,The tinkling fountains set in gardens coolAbout the pillared palaces, and blentWith trickling of the conduits in the squares,The noisy teams within the narrow streets,--All these the stranger heard and did not hear,While ringing bells pealed out above the town,And calm gray twilight skies stretched over it.Wide open stood the doors of every church,And through the porches pressed a streaming throng.Vague wonderment perplexed him, at the sightOf broken columns raised to JupiterBeside the cross, immense cathedrals rearedUpon a dead faith's ruins; all the whirlAnd eager bustle of the living townFilling the storied streets, whose very stonesWere solemn monuments, and spake of death.Although he wrestled with himself, the thoughtOf that poor, past religion smote his heartWith a huge pity and deep sympathy,Beyond the fervor which the Church inspired.Where was the noble race who ruled the world,Moulded of purest elements, and stuffedWith sternest virtues, every man a king,Wearing the purple native in his heart?These lounging beggars, stealthy monks and priests,And womanish patricians filled their place.Thus Tannhauser, still half an infidel,Pagan through mind and Christian through the heart,Fared thoughtfully with wandering, aimless steps,Till in the dying glimmer of the dayHe raised his eyes and found himself aloneAmid the ruined arches, broken shafts,And huge arena of the Coliseum.He did not see it as it was, dim-litBy something less than day and more than night,With wan reflections of the rising moonRather divined than seen on ivied walls,And crumbled battlements, and topless columns--But by the light of all the ancient days,Ringed with keen eager faces, living eyes,Fixed on the circus with a savage joy,Where brandished swords flashed white, and human bloodStreamed o'er the thirsty dust, and Death was king.He started, shuddering, and drew breath to seeThe foul pit choked with weeds and tumbled stones,The cross raised midmost, and the peaceful moonShining o'er all; and fell upon his knees,Restored to faith in one wise, loving God.Day followed day, and still he bode in Rome,Waiting his audience with the Cardinal,And from the gates, on pretext frivolous,Passed daily forth,--his Eminency slept,--Again, his Eminency was fatiguedBy tedious sessions of the Papal court,And thus the patient pilgrim was referredUnto a later hour.  At last the pageBore him a missive with Filippo's seal,That in his name commended TannhauserUnto the Pope.  The worn, discouraged knightRead the brief scroll, then sadly forth again,Along the bosky alleys of the park,Passed to the glare and noise of summer streets."Good God!" he muttered, "Thou hast ears for all,And sendest help and comfort; yet these men,Thy saintly ministers, must deck themselvesWith arrogance, and from their large delightIn all the beauty of the beauteous earth,And peace of indolent, untempted souls,Deny the hungry outcast a bare word."Yet even as he nourished bitter thoughts,He felt a depth of clear serenity,Unruffled in his heart beneath it all.No outward object now had farther powerTo wound him there, for the brooding o'er those deepsOf vast contrition was boundless hope.  Yet not to leave a human chance untried,He sought the absolution of the Pope.In a great hall with airy galleries,Thronged with high dignitaries of the Church,He took his seat amidst the humblest friars.Through open windows came sweet garden smells,Bright morning light, and twittered song of birds.Around the hall flashed gold and sunlit gems,And splendid wealth of color,--white-stoled priests,And scarlet cardinals, and bishops cladIn violet vestments,--while beneath the shadeOf the high gallery huddled dusky shapes,With faded, travel-tattered, sombre smocks,And shaven heads, and girdles of coarse hemp;Some, pilgrims penitent like Tannhauser;Some, devotees to kiss the sacred feet.The brassy blare of trumpets smote the air,Shrill pipes and horns with swelling clamor came,And through the doorway's wide-stretched tapestriesPassed the Pope's trumpeters and mace-bearers,His vergers bearing slender silver wands,Then mitred bishops, red-clad cardinals,The stalwart Papal Guard with halberds raised,And then, with white head crowned with gold ingemmed,The vicar of the lowly Galilean,Holding his pastoral rod of smooth-hewn wood,With censer swung before and peacock fansWaved constantly by pages, either side.Attended thus, they bore him to his throne,And priests and laymen fell upon their knees.Then, after pause of brief and silent prayer,The pilgrims singly through the hall defiled,To kiss the borders of the papal skirts,Smiting their foreheads on the paven stone;Some silent, abject, some accusing themOf venial sins in accents of remorse,Craving his grace, and passing pardoned forth.Sir Tannhauser came last, no need for himTo cry "Peccavi," and crook suppliant knees.His gray head rather crushed than bowed, his faceLivid and wasted, his deep thoughtful eyes,His tall gaunt form in those unseemly weeds,Spake more than eloquence.  His hollow voiceBrake silence, saying, "I am Tannhauser.For seven years I lived apart from men,Within the Venusberg."  A horror seizedThe assembled folk; some turbulently rose;Some clamored, "From the presence cast him forth!"But the knight never ceased his steady gazeUpon the Pope.  At last,--"I have not spokenTo be condemned," he said, "by such as these.Thou, spiritual Father, answer me.Look thou upon me with the eyes of Christ.Can I through expiation gain my shrift,And work mine own redemption?"  "Insolent man!"Thundered the outraged Pope, "is this the toneWherewith thou dost parade thy loathsome sin?Down on thy knees, and wallow on the earth!Nay, rather go! there is no ray of hope,No gleam, through cycles of eternity,For the redemption of a soul like thine.Yea, sooner shall my pastoral rod branch forthIn leaf and blossom, and green shoots of spring,Than Christ will pardon thee."  And as he spoke,He struck the rod upon the floor with forceThat gave it entrance 'twixt two loosened tiles,So that it stood, fast-rooted and alone.The knight saw naught, he only heard his judgeRing forth his curses, and the court cry out"Anathema!" and loud, and blent therewith,Derisive laughter in the very hall,And a wild voice that thrilled through flesh and heart:"ONCE BEING MINE, THOU ART FOREVER MINE!"Half-mad he clasped both hands upon his brow,Amidst the storm of voices, till they died,And all was silence, save the reckless songOf a young bird upon a twig without.Then a defiant, ghastly face he raised,And shrieked, "'T is false!  I am no longer thine!"And through the windows open to the park,Rushed forth, beyond the sight and sound of men.  By church nor palace paused he, till he passedAll squares and streets, and crossed the bridge of stone,And stood alone amidst the broad expanseOf the Campagna, twinkling in the heat.He knelt upon a knoll of turf, and snappedThe cord that held the cross about his neck,And far from him the leaden burden flung."O God!  I thank Thee, that my faith in TheeSubsists at last, through all discouragements.Between us must no type nor symbol stand,No mediator, were he more divineThan the incarnate Christ.  All forms, all priests,I part aside, and hold communion freeBeneath the empty sky of noon, with naughtBetween my nothingness and thy high heavens--Spirit with spirit.  O, have mercy, God!Cleanse me from lust and bitterness and pride,Have mercy in accordance with my faith."Long time he lay upon the scorching grass,With his face buried in the tangled weeds.Ah! who can tell the struggles of his soulAgainst its demons in that sacred hour,The solitude, the anguish, the remorse?When shadows long and thin lay on the ground,Shivering with fever, helpless he arose,But with a face divine, ineffable,Such as we dream the face of Israel,When the Lord's wrestling angel, at gray dawn,Blessed him, and disappeared.                                 Upon the marsh,All night, he wandered, striving to emergeFrom the wild, pathless plain,--now limitlessAnd colorless beneath the risen moon;Outstretching like a sea, with landmarks none,Save broken aqueducts and parapets,And ruined columns glinting 'neath the moon.His dress was dank and clinging with the dew;A thousand insects fluttered o'er his head,With buzz and drone; unseen cicadas chirpedAmong the long, rank grass, and far and nearThe fire-flies flickered through the summer air.Vague thoughts and gleams prophetic filled his brain."Ah, fool!" he mused, "to look for help from men.Had they the will to aid, they lack the power.In mine own flesh and soul the sin had birth,Through mine own anguish it must be atoned.Our saviours are not saints and ministers,But tear-strung women, children soft of heart,Or fellow-sufferers, who, by some chance word,Some glance of comfort, save us from despair.These I have found, thank heaven! to strengthen trustIn mine own kind, when all the world grew dark.Make me not proud in spirit, O my God!Yea, in thy sight I am one mass of sin,One black and foul corruption, yet I knowMy frailty is exceeded by thy love.Neither is this the slender straw of hope,Whereto I, drowning, cling, but firm belief,That fills my inmost soul with vast content.As surely as the hollow faiths of oldShriveled to dust before one ray of Truth,So will these modern temples pass away,Piled upon rotten doctrines, baseless forms,And man will look in his own breast for help,Yea, search for comfort his own inward reins,Revere himself, and find the God within.Patience and patience!"  Through the sleepless nightHe held such thoughts; at times before his eyesFlashed glimpses of the Church that was to be,Sublimely simple in the light sereneOf future ages; then the vision changedTo the Pope's hall, thronged with high priests, who hurledTheir curses on him.  Staggering, he awokeUnto the truth, and found himself alone,Beneath the awful stars.  When dawn's first chillCrept though the shivering grass and heavy leaves,Giddy and overcome, he fell and sleptUpon the dripping weeds, nor dreamed nor stirred,Until the wide plain basked in noon's broad light.He dragged his weary frame some paces more,Unto a solitary herdsman's hut,Which, in the vagueness of the moonlit night,Was touched with lines of beauty, till it grewFair as the ruined works of ancient art,Now squat and hideous with its wattled roof,Decaying timbers, and loose door wide oped,Half-fallen from the hinge.  A drowsy man,Bearded and burnt, in shepherd habit lay,Stretched on the floor, slow-munching, half asleep,His frugal fare; for thus, at blaze of noon,The shepherds sought a shelter from the sun,Leaving their vigilant dogs beside their flock.The knight craved drink and bread, and with respectFor pilgrim weeds, the Roman herdsman stirredHis lazy length, and shared with him his meal.Refreshed and calm, Sir Tannhauser passed forth,Yearning with morbid fancy once againTo see the kind face of the minstrel boyHe met beside the well.  At set of sunHe reached the place; the reaping-folk were gone,The day's toil over, yet he took his seat.A milking-girl with laden buckets full,Came slowly from the pasture, paused and drank.From a near cottage ran a ragged boy,And filled his wooden pail, and to his homeReturned across the fields.  A herdsman came,And drank and gave his dog to drink, and passed,Greeting the holy man who sat there still,Awaiting.  But his feeble pulse beat highWhen he descried at last a youthful form,Crossing the field, a pitcher on his head,Advancing towards the well.  Yea, this was he,The same grave eyes, and open, girlish face.But he saw not, amidst the landscape brown,The knight's brown figure, who, to win his ear,Asked the lad's name.  "My name is Salvator,To serve you, sir," he carelessly replied,With eyes and hands intent upon his jar,Brimming and bubbling.  Then he cast one glanceUpon his questioner, and left the well,Crying with keen and sudden sympathy,"Good Father, pardon me, I knew you not.Ah! you have travelled overmuch: your feetAre grimed with mud and wet, your face is changed,Your hands are dry with fever."  But the knight:"Nay, as I look on thee, I think the LordWills not that I should suffer any more.""Then you have suffered much," sighed Salvator,With wondering pity.  "You must come with me;My father knows of you, I told him all.A knight and minstrel who cast by his lyre,His health and fame, to give himself to God,--Yours is a life indeed to be desired!If you will lie with us this night, our homeWill verily be blessed."  By kindness crushed,Wandering in sense and words, the broken knightResisted naught, and let himself be ledTo the boy's home.  The outcast and accursedWas welcomed now by kindly human hands;Once more his blighted spirit was revivedBy contact with refreshing innocence.There, when the morning broke upon the world,The humble hosts no longer knew their guest.His fleshly weeds of sin forever doffed,Tannhauser lay and smiled, for in the nightThe angel came who brings eternal peace.           ____________________Far into Wartburg, through all Italy,In every town the Pope sent messengers,Riding in furious haste; among them, oneWho bore a branch of dry wood burst in bloom;The pastoral rod had borne green shoots of spring,And leaf and blossom.

The wondrous golden sunIs linked unto the glow-worm's tiny spark;The eagle soars to heaven in his flight;And in those realms of space, all bathed in light,Soar none except the eagle and the lark.            MATINS.Gray earth, gray mist, gray sky:Through vapors hurrying by,Larger than wont, on high  Floats the horned, yellow moon.Chill airs are faintly stirred,And far away is heard,Of some fresh-awakened bird,  The querulous, shrill tune.The dark mist hides the faceOf the dim land: no traceOf rock or river's place  In the thick air is drawn;But dripping grass smells sweet,And rustling branches meet,And sounding water greet  The slow, sure, sacred dawn.Past is the long black night,With its keen lightnings white,Thunder and floods: new light  The glimmering low east streaks.The dense clouds part: betweenTheir jagged rents are seenPale reaches blue and green,  As the mirk curtain breaks.Above the shadowy world,Still more and more unfurled,The gathered mists upcurled  Like phantoms melt and pass.In clear-obscure revealed,Brown wood, gray stream, dark field:Fresh, healthy odors yield  Wet furrows, flowers, and grass.The sudden, splendid gleamOf one thin, golden beamShoots from the feathered rim  Of yon hill crowned with woods.Down its embowered side,As living waters slide,So the great morning tide  Follows in sunny floods.From bush and hedge and treeJoy, unrestrained and free,Breaks forth in melody,  Twitter and chirp and song:Alive the festal airWith gauze-winged creatures fair,That flicker everywhere,  Dart, poise, and flash along.The shining mists are gone,Slight films of gold swift-blownBefore the strong, bright sun  Or the deep-colored sky:A world of life and glowSparkles and basks below,Where the soft meads a-row,  Hoary with dew-fall, lie.Does not the morn break thus,Swift, bright, victorious,With new skies cleared for us,  Over the soul storm-tost?Her night was long and deep,Strange visions vexed her sleep,Strange sorrows bade her weep:  Her faith in dawn was lost.No halt, no rest for her,The immortal wandererFrom sphere to higher sphere,  Toward the pure source of day.The new light shames her fears,Her faithlessness, her tears,As the new sun appears  To light her godlike way.               SAINT ROMUALDO.I give God thanks that I, a lean old man,Wrinkled, infirm, and crippled with keen painsBy austere penance and continuous toil,Now rest in spirit, and possess "the peaceWhich passeth understanding." Th' end draws nigh,Though the beginning is yesterday,And a broad lifetime spreads 'twixt this and that--A favored life, though outwardly the buttOf ignominy, malice, and affront,Yet lighted from within by the clear starOf a high aim, and graciously prolongedTo see at last its utmost goal attained.I speak not of mine Order and my House,Here founded by my hands and filled with saints--A white society of snowy souls,Swayed by my voice, by mine example led;For this is but the natural harvest reapedFrom labors such as mine when blessed by God.Though I rejoice to think my spirit stillWill work my purposes, through worthy hands,After my bones are shriveled into dust,Yet have I gleaned a finer, sweeter fruitOf holy satisfaction, sure and real,Though subtler than the tissue of the air--The power completely to detach the soulFrom her companion through this life, the flesh;So that in blessed privacy of peace,Communing with high angels, she can hold,Serenely rapt, her solitary course.  Ye know, O saints of heaven, what I have borneOf discipline and scourge; the twisted lashOf knotted rope that striped my shrinking limbs;Vigils and fasts protracted, till my fleshWasted and crumbled from mine aching bones,And the last skin, one woof of pain and sores,Thereto like yellow parchment loosely clung;Exposure to the fever and the frost,When 'mongst the hollows of the hills I lurkedFrom persecution of misguided folk,Accustoming my spirit to ignoreThe burden of the cross, while picturingThe bliss of disembodied souls, the graceOf holiness, the lives of sainted men,And entertaining all exalted thoughts,That nowise touched the trouble of the hour,Until the grief and pain seemed far less realThan the creations of my brain inspired.The vision, the beatitude, were true:The agony was but an evil dream.I speak not now as one who hath not learnedThe purport of those lightly-bandied words,Evil and Fate, but rather one who knowsThe thunders of the terrors of the world.No mortal chance or change, no earthly shock,Can move or reach my soul, securely thronedOn heights of contemplation and calm prayer,Happy, serene, no less actual joyOf present peace than faith in joys to come.  This soft, sweet, yellow evening, how the treesStand crisp against the clear, bright-colored sky!How the white mountain-tops distinctly shine,Taking and giving radiance, and the slopesAre purpled with rich floods of peach-hued light!Thank God, my filmy, old dislustred eyesFind the same sense of exquisite delight,My heart vibrates to the same touch of joyIn scenes like this, as when my pulse danced high,And youth coursed through my veins!  This the one linkThat binds the wan old man that now I amTo the wild lad who followed up the houndsAmong Ravenna's pine-woods by the sea.For there how oft would I lose all delightIn the pursuit, the triumph, or the game,To stray alone among the shadowy glades,And gaze, as one who is not satisfiedWith gazing, at the large, bright, breathing sea,The forest glooms, and shifting gleams betweenThe fine dark fringes of the fadeless trees,On gold-green turf, sweet-brier, and wild pink rose!How rich that buoyant air with changing scentOf pungent pine, fresh flowers, and salt cool seas!And when all echoes of the chase had died,Of horn and halloo, bells and baying hounds,How mine ears drank the ripple of the tideOn the fair shore, the chirp of unseen birds,The rustling of the tangled undergrowth,And the deep lyric murmur of the pines,When through their high tops swept the sudden breeze!There was my world, there would my heart dilate,And my aspiring soul dissolve in prayerUnto that Spirit of Love whose energiesWere active round me, yet whose presence, spheredIn the unsearchable, unbodied air,Made itself felt, but reigned invisible.This ere the day that made me what I am.Still can I see the hot, bright sky, the seaIllimitably sparkling, as they showedThat morning.  Though I deemed I took no noteOf heaven or earth or waters, yet my mindRetains to-day the vivid portraitureOf every line and feature of the scene.Light-hearted 'midst the dewy lanes I faredUnto the sea, whose jocund gleam I caughtBetween the slim boles, when I heard the clinkOf naked weapons, then a sudden thrustSickening to hear, and then a stifled groan;And pressing forward I beheld the sightThat seared itself for ever on my brain--My kinsman, Ser Ranieri, on the turf,Fallen upon his side, his bright young headAmong the pine-spurs, and his cheek pressed closeUnto the moist, chill sod: his fingers clutchedA handful of loose weeds and grass and earth,Uprooted in his anguish as he fell,And slowly from his heart the thick stream flowed,Fouling the green, leaving the fair, sweet faceGhastly, transparent, with blue, stony eyesStaring in blankness on that other oneWho triumphed over him.  With hot desireOf instant vengeance I unsheathed my swordTo rush upon the slayer, when he turnedIn his first terror of blood-guiltiness.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .Within my heart a something snapped and brake.What was it but the chord of rapturous joyFor ever stilled?  I tottered and would fall,Had I not leaned against the friendly pine;For all realities of life, unmooredFrom their firm anchorage, appeared to floatLike hollow phantoms past my dizzy brain.The strange delusion wrought upon my soulThat this had been enacted ages since.This very horror curdled at my heart,This net of trees spread round, these iron heavens,Were closing over me when I had stood,Unnumbered cycles back, and fronted HIM,My father; and he felt mine eyes as now,Yet saw me not; and then, as now, that form,The one thing real, lay stretched between us both.The fancy passed, and I stood sane and strongTo grasp the truth.  Then I remembered all--A few fierce words between them yester eveConcerning some poor plot of pasturage,Soon silenced into courteous, frigid calm:This was the end.  I could not meet him now,To curse him, to accuse him, or to save,And draw him from the red entanglementCoiled by his own hands round his ruined life.God pardon me!  My heart that moment heldNo drop of pity toward this wretched soul;And cowering down, as though his guilt were mine,I fled amidst the savage silencesOf that grim wood, resolved to nurse aloneMy boundless desolation, shame, and grief.  There, in that thick-leaved twilight of high noon,The quiet of the still, suspended air,Once more my wandering thoughts were calmly ranged,Shepherded by my will.  I wept, I prayedA solemn prayer, conceived in agony,Blessed with response instant, miraculous;For in that hour my spirit was at oneWith Him who knows and satisfies her needs.The supplication and the blessing sprangFrom the same source, inspired divinely both.I prayed for light, self-knowledge, guidance, truth,And these like heavenly manna were rained downTo feed my hungered soul.  His guilt was mine.What angel had been sent to stay mine armUntil the fateful moment passed awayThat would have ushered an eternityOf withering remorse?  I found the germsIn mine own heart of every human sin,That waited but occasion's tempting breathTo overgrow with poisoned bloom my life.What God thus far had saved me from myself?Here was the lofty truth revealed, that eachMust feel himself in all, must know where'erThe great soul acts or suffers or enjoys,His proper soul in kinship there is bound.Then my life-purpose dawned upon my mind,Encouraging as morning.  As I lay,Crushed by the weight of universal love,Which mine own thoughts had heaped upon myself,I heard the clear chime of a slow, sweet bell.I knew it--whence it came and what it sang.From the gray convent nigh the wood it pealed,And called the monks to prayer.  Vigil and prayer,Clean lives, white days of strict austerity:Such were the offerings of these holy saints.How far might such not tend to expiateA riotous world's indulgence?  Here my life,Doubly austere and doubly sanctified,Might even for that other one atone,So bound to mine, till both should be forgiven.  They sheltered me, not questioning the needThat led me to their cloistered solitude.How rich, how freighted with pure influence,With dear security of perfect peace,Was the first day I passed within those walls!The holy habit of perpetual prayer,The gentle greetings, the rare temperate speech,The chastening discipline, the atmosphereOf settled and profound tranquillity,Were even as living waters unto oneWho perisheth of thirst.  Was this the worldThat yesterday seemed one huge battlefieldFor brutish passions?  Could the soul of manWithdraw so easily, and erect apartHer own fair temple for her own high ends?But this serene contentment slowly wanedAs I discerned the broad disparityBetwixt the form and spirit of the lawsThat bound the order in strait brotherhood.Yet when I sought to gain a larger love,More rigid discipline, severer truth,And more complete surrender of the soulUnto her God, this was to my reproach,And scoffs and gibes beset me on all sides.In mine own cell I mortified my flesh,I held aloof from all my brethren's feastsTo wrestle with my viewless enemies,Till they should leave their blessing on my head;For nightly was I haunted by that face,White, bloodless, as I saw it 'midst the ferns,Now staring out of darkness, and it heldMine eyes from slumber and my brain from restAnd drove me from my straw to weep and pray.Rebellious thoughts such subtle torture wroughtUpon my spirit that I lay day-longIn dumb despair, until the blessed hopeOf mercy dawned again upon my soul,As gradual as the slow gold moon that mountsThe airy steps of heaven.  My faith aroseWith sure perception that disaster, wrong,And every shadow of man's destinyAre merely circumstance, and cannot touchThe soul's fine essence: they exist or dieOnly as she affirms them or denies.  This faith sustain me even to the end:It floods my heart with peace as surely nowAs on that day the friars drove me forth,Urging that my asceticism, too harsh,Endured through pride, would bring into reproachTheir customs and their order.  Then beganMy exile in the mountains, where I bodeA hunted man.  The elements conspiredAgainst me, and I was the seasons' sport,Drenched, parched, and scorched and frozen alternately,Burned with shrewd frosts, prostrated by fierce heats,Shivering 'neath chilling dews and gusty rains,And buffeted by all the winds of heaven.Yet was this period my time of joy:My daily thoughts perpetual converse heldWith angels ministrant; mine ears were charmedWith sweet accordance of celestial sounds,Song, harp and choir, clear ringing through the air.And visions were revealed unto mine eyesBy night and day of Heaven's very courts,In shadowless, undimmed magnificence.I gave God thanks, not that He sheltered me,And fed me as He feeds the fowls of air--For had I perished, this too had been well--But for the revelation of His truth,The glory, the beatitude vouchsafedTo exalt, to heal, to quicken, to inspire;So that the pinched, lean excommunicateWas crowned with joy more solid, more secure,Than all the comfort of the vales could bring.Then the good Lord touched certain fervid hearts,Aspiring toward His love, to come to me,Timid and few at first; but as they heardFrom mine own lips the precious oracles,That soothed the trouble of their souls, appeasedTheir spiritual hunger, and disclosedAll of the God within them to themselves,They flocked about me, and they hailed me saint,And sware to follow and to serve the goodWhich my word published and my life declared.Thus the lone hermit of the mountain-topDescended leader of a band of saints,And midway 'twixt the summit and the valeI perched my convent.  Yet I bated notOne whit of strict restraint and abstinence.And they who love me and who serve the truthHave learned to suffer with me, and have wonThe supreme joy that is not of the flesh,Foretasting the delights of Paradise.This faith, to them imparted, will endureAfter my tongue hath ceased to utter it,And the great peace hath settled on my soul.               AFTERNOON.    Small, shapeless drifts of cloudSail slowly northward in the soft-hued sky,  With blur half-tints and rolling summits bright,By the late sun caressed; slight hazes shroud  All things afar; shineth each leaf anigh    With its own warmth and light.    O'erblown by Southland airs,The summer landscape basks in utter peace:  In lazy streams the lazy clouds are seen;Low hills, broad meadows, and large, clear-cut squares  Of ripening corn-fields, rippled by the breeze,    With shifting shade and sheen.    Hark! and you may not hearA sound less soothing than the rustle cool  Of swaying leaves, the steady wiry droneOf unseen crickets, sudden chirpings clear  Of happy birds, the tinkle of the pool,    Chafed by a single stone.    What vague, delicious dreams,Born of this golden hour of afternoon,  And air balm-freighted, fill the soul with bliss,Transpierced like yonder clouds with lustrous gleams,  Fantastic, brief as they, and, like them, spun    Of gilded nothingness!    All things are well with her.'T is good to be alive, to see the light  That plays upon the grass, to feel (and sighWith perfect pleasure) the mild breezes stir  Among the garden roses, red and white,    With whiffs of fragrancy.    There is no troublous thought,No painful memory, no grave regret,  To mar the sweet suggestions of the hour:The soul, at peace, reflects the peace without,  Forgetting grief as sunset skies forget    The morning's transient shower.               PHANTASIES.          (After Robert Schumann).                I. Evening.Rest, beauty, stillness: not a waif of a cloudFrom gray-blue east sheer to the yellow west--No film of mist the utmost slopes to shroud.The earth lies grace, by quiet airs caressed,And shepherdeth her shadows, but each stream,Free to the sky, is by that glow possessed,And traileth with the splendors of a dreamAthwart the dusky land.  Uplift thine eyes!Unbroken by a vapor or a gleam,The vast clear reach of mild, wan twilight skies.But look again, and lo, the evening star!Against the pale tints black the slim elms rise,The earth exhales sweet odors nigh and far,And from the heavens fine influences fall.Familiar things stand not for what they are:What they suggest, foreshadow, or recallThe spirit is alert to apprehend,Imparting somewhat of herself to all.Labor and thought and care are at an end:The soul is filled with gracious reveries,And with her mood soft sounds and colors blend;For simplest sounds ring forth like melodiesIn this weird-lighted air--the monotoneOf some far bell, the distant farmyard cries,A barking dog, the thin, persistent droneOf crickets, and the lessening call of birds.The apparition of yon star aloneBreaks on the sense like music.  Beyond wordThe peace that floods the soul, for night is here,And Beauty still is guide and harbinger.                II. Aspiration.Dark lies the earth, and bright with worlds the sky:That soft, large, lustrous star, that first outshone,Still holds us spelled with potent sorcery.Dilating, shrinking, lightening, it hath wonOur spirit with its strange strong influence,And sways it as the tides beneath the moon.What impulse this, o'ermastering heart and sense?Exalted, thrilled, the freed soul fain would soarUnto that point of shining prominence,Craving new fields and some unheard-of shore,Yea, all the heavens, for her activity,To mount with daring flight, to hover o'erLow hills of earth, flat meadows, level sea,And earthly joy and trouble.  In this hourOf waning light and sound, of mystery,Of shadowed love and beauty-veiled power,She feels her wings: she yearns to grasp her own,Knowing the utmost good to be her dower.A dream! a dream! for at a touch 't is gone.O mocking spirit! thy mere fools are we,Unto the depths from heights celestial thrown.From these blind gropings toward reality,This thirst for truth, this most pathetic needOf something to uplift, to justify,To help and comfort while we faint and bleed,May we not draw, wrung from the last despair,Some argument of hope, some blessed creed,That we can trust the faith which whispers prayer,The vanishings, the ecstasy, the gleam,The nameless aspiration, and the dream?               III. Wherefore?Deep languor overcometh mind and frame:A listless, drowsy, utter weariness,A trance wherein no thought finds speech or name,The overstrained spirit doth possess.She sinks with drooping wing--poor unfledged bird,That fain had flown!--in fluttering breathlessness.To what end those high hopes that wildly stirredThe beating heart with aspirations vain?Why proffer prayers unanswered and unheardTo blank, deaf heavens that will not heed her pain?Where lead these lofty, soaring tendencies,That leap and fly and poise, to fall again,Yet seem to link her with the utmost skies?What mean these clinging loves that bind to earth,And claim her with beseeching, wistful eyes?This little resting-place 'twixt death and birth,Why is it fretted with the ceaseless flowOf flood and ebb, with overgrowth and dearth,And vext with dreams, and clouded with strange woe?Ah! she is tired of thought, she yearns for peace,Seeing all things one equal end must know.Wherefore this tangle of perplexities,The trouble or the joy? the weary mazeOf narrow fears and hopes that may not cease?A chill falls on her from the skyey ways,Black with the night-tide, where is none to hearThe ancient cry, the Wherefore of our days.               IV. Fancies.The ceaseless whirr of crickets fills the earFrom underneath each hedge and bush and tree,Deep in the dew-drenched grasses everywhere.The simple sound dispels the fantasyOf gloom and terror gathering round the mind.It seems a pleasant thing to breathe, to be,To hear the many-voiced, soft summer windLisp through the dark thick leafage overhead--To see the rosy half-moon soar behindThe black slim-branching elms.  Sad thoughts have fled,Trouble and doubt, and now strange reveriesAnd odd caprices fill us in their stead.From yonder broken disk the redness dies,Like gold fruit through the leaves the half-sphere gleams,Then over the hoar tree-tops climbs the skies,Blanched ever more and more, until it beamsWhiter than crystal.  Like a scroll unfurled,And shadowy as a landscape seen in dreams,Reveals itself the sleeping, quiet world,Painted in tender grays and whites subdued--The speckled stream with flakes of light impearled,The wide, soft meadow and the massive wood.Naught is too wild for our credulityIn this weird hour: our finest dreams hold good.Quaint elves and frolic flower-sprites we see,And fairies weaving rings of gossamer,And angels floating through the filmy air.               V. In the Night.Let us go in: the air is dank and chillWith dewy midnight, and the moon rides highO'er ghostly fields, pale stream, and spectral hill.This hour the dawn seems farthest from the skySo weary long the space that lies betweenThat sacred joy and this dark mysteryOf earth and heaven: no glimmering is seen,In the star-sprinkled east, of coming day,Nor, westward, of the splendor that hath been.Strange fears beset us, nameless terrors swayThe brooding soul, that hungers for her rest,Out worn with changing moods, vain hopes' delay,With conscious thought o'erburdened and oppressed.The mystery and the shadow wax too deep;She longs to merge both sense and thought in sleep.               VI. Faerie.From the oped lattice glance once more abroadWhile the ethereal moontide bathes with lightHill, stream, and garden, and white-winding road.All gracious myths born of the shadowy nightRecur, and hover in fantastic guise,Airy and vague, before the drowsy sight.On yonder soft gray hill Endymion liesIn rosy slumber, and the moonlit airBreathes kisses on his cheeks and lips and eyes.'Twixt bush and bush gleam flower-white limbs, left bare,Of huntress-nymphs, and flying raiment thin,Vanishing faces, and bright floating hair.The quaint midsummer fairies and their kin,Gnomes, elves, and trolls, on blossom, branch, and grassGambol and dance, and winding out and inLeave circles of spun dew where'er they pass.Through the blue ether the freed Ariel flies;Enchantment holds the air; a swarming massOf myriad dusky, gold-winged dreams arise,Throng toward the gates of sense, and so possessThe soul, and lull it to forgetfulness.            VII. Confused Dreams.O strange, dim other-world revealed to us,Beginning there where ends reality,Lying 'twixt life and death, and populousWith souls from either sphere! now enter weThy twisted paths.  Barred is the silver gate,But the wild-carven doors of ivorySpring noiselessly apart: between them straightFlies forth a cloud of nameless shadowy things,With harpies, imps, and monsters, small and great,Blurring the thick air with darkening wings.All humors of the blood and brain take shape,And fright us with our own imaginings.A trouble weighs upon us: no escapeFrom this unnatural region can there be.Fixed eyes stare on us, wide mouths grin and gape,Familiar faces out of reach we see.Fain would we scream, to shatter with a cryThe tangled woof of hideous fantasy,When, lo! the air grows clear, a soft fair skyShines over head: sharp pain dissolves in peace;Beneath the silver archway quietlyWe float away: all troublous visions cease.By a strange sense of joy we are possessed,Body and spirit soothed in perfect rest.            VIII. The End of the Song.What dainty note of long-drawn melodyAthwart our dreamless sleep rings sweet and clear,Till all the fumes of slumber are brushed by,And with awakened consciousness we hearThe pipe of birds?  Look forth!  The sane, white dayBlesses the hilltops, and the sun is near.All misty phantoms slowly roll awayWith the night's vapors toward the western sky.The Real enchants us, the fresh breath of hayBlows toward us; soft the meadow-grasses lie,Bearded with dew; the air is a caress;The sudden sun o'ertops the boundaryOf eastern hills, the morning joyousnessThrills tingling through the frame; life's pulse beats strong;Night's fancies melt like dew.  So ends the song!    ON THE PROPOSAL TO ERECT A MONUMENT          IN ENGLAND TO LORD BYRON.The grass of fifty Aprils hath waved green  Above the spent heart, the Olympian head,The hands crost idly, the shut eyes unseen,  Unseeing, the locked lips whose song hath fled;Yet mystic-lived, like some rich, tropic flower,His fame puts forth fresh blossoms hour by hour;Wide spread the laden branches dropping dew  On the low, laureled brow misunderstood,  That bent not, neither bowed, until subduedBy the last foe who crowned while he o'erthrew.Fair was the Easter Sabbath morn when first  Men heard he had not wakened to its light:The end had come, and time had done its worst,  For the black cloud had fallen of endless night.Then in the town, as Greek accosted Greek,'T was not the wonted festal words to speak,"Christ is arisen," but "Our chief is gone,"  With such wan aspect and grief-smitten head  As when the awful cry of "Pan is dead!"Filled echoing hill and valley with its moan."I am more fit for death than the world deems,"  So spake he as life's light was growing dim,And turned to sleep as unto soothing dreams.  What terrors could its darkness hold for him,Familiar with all anguish, but with fearStill unacquainted?  On his martial bierThey laid a sword, a helmet, and a crown--  Meed of the warrior, but not these among  His voiceless lyre, whose silent chords unstrungShall wait--how long?--for touches like his own.An alien country mourned him as her son,  And hailed him hero: his sole, fitting tombWere Theseus' temple or the Parthenon,  Fondly she deemed.  His brethren bare him home,Their exiled glory, past the guarded gateWhere England's Abbey shelters England's great.Afar he rests whose very name hath shed  New lustre on her with the song he sings.  So Shakespeare rests who scorned to lie with kings,Sleeping at peace midst the unhonored dead.And fifty years suffice to overgrow  With gentle memories the foul weeds of hateThat shamed his grave.  The world begins to know  Her loss, and view with other eyes his fate.Even as the cunning workman brings to passThe sculptor's thought from out the unwieldy massOf shapeless marble, so Time lops away  The stony crust of falsehood that concealed  His just proportions, and, at last revealed,The statue issues to the light of day,Most beautiful, most human.  Let them fling  The first stone who are tempted even as he,And have not swerved.  When did that rare soul sing  The victim's shame, the tyrant's eulogy,The great belittle, or exalt the small,Or grudge his gift, his blood, to disenthrallThe slaves of tyranny or ignorance?  Stung by fierce tongues himself, whose rightful fame  Hath he reviled?  Upon what noble nameDid the winged arrows of the barbed wit glance?The years' thick, clinging curtains backward pull,  And show him as he is, crowned with bright beams,"Beauteous, and yet not all as beautiful  As he hath been or might be; Sorrow seemsHalf of his immortality."*  He needsNo monument whose name and song and deedsAre graven in all foreign hearts; but she  His mother, England, slow and last to wake,  Needs raise the votive shaft for her fame's sake:Hers is the shame if such forgotten be!  May, 1875.  *"Cain," Act I. Scene 1.            ARABESQUE.On a background of pale goldI would trace with quaint design,    Penciled fine,Brilliant-colored, Moorish scenes,Mosques and crescents, pages, queens,    Line on line,That the prose-world of to-dayMight the gorgeous Past's array    Once behold.On the magic painted shieldRich Granada's Vega green    Should be seen;Crystal fountains, coolness flinging,Hanging gardens' skyward springing    Emerald sheen;Ruddy when the daylight falls,Crowned Alhambra's beetling walls    Stand revealed;Balconies that overbrowField and city, vale and stream.    In a dreamLulled the drowsy landscape basks;    Mark the gleamSilvery of each white-swathed peak!Mountain-airs caress the cheek,    Fresh from the snow.Here in Lindaraxa's bowerThe immortal roses bloom;    In the roomLion-guarded, marble-paven,Still the fountain leaps to heaven.    But the doomOf the banned and stricken raceOvershadows every place,    Every hour.Where fair Lindaraxa dweltFlits the bat on velvet wings;    Mute the stringsOf the broken mandoline;The Pavilion of the Queen    Widely flingsVacant windows to the night;Moonbeams kiss the floor with light    Where she knelt.Through these halls that people steppedWho through darkling centuries    Held the keysOf all wisdom, truth, and art,In a Paradise apart,   Lapped in ease,Sagely pondering deathless themes,While, befooled with monkish dreams,    Europe slept.Where shall they be found today?Yonder hill that frets the sky    "The last SighOf the Moor" is named still.There the ill-starred Boabdil    Bade good-byTo Granada and to Spain,Where the Crescent ne'er again    Holdeth sway.Vanished like the wind that blows,Whither shall we seek their trace    On earth's face?The gigantic wheel of fate,Crushing all things soon or late,   Now a race,Now a single life o'erruns,Now a universe of suns,    Now a rose.            AGAMEMNON'S TOMB.Uplift the ponderous, golden mask of death,  And let the sun shine on him as it didHow many thousand years agone!  Beneath  This worm-defying, uncorrupted lid,Behold the young, heroic face, round-eyed,Of one who in his full-flowered manhood died;  Of nobler frame than creatures of to-day,Swathed in fine linen cerecloths fold on fold,With carven weapons wrought of bronze and gold,  Accoutred like a warrior for the fray.We gaze in awe at these huge-modeled limbs,  Shrunk in death's narrow house, but hinting yetTheir ancient majesty; these sightless rims  Whose living eyes the eyes of Helen met;The speechless lips that ah! what tales might tellOf earth's morning-tide when gods did dwell  Amidst a generous-fashioned, god-like race,Who dwarf our puny semblance, and who wonThe secret soul of Beauty for their own,  While all our art but crudely apes their grace.We gather all the precious relics up,  The golden buttons chased with wondrous craft,The sculptured trinkets and the crystal cup,  The sheathed, bronze sword, the knife with brazen haft.Fain would we wrest with curious eyes from theseUnnumbered long-forgotten histories,  The deeds heroic of this mighty man,On whom once more the living daylight beams,To shame our littleness, to mock our dreams,  And the abyss of centuries to span.Yet could we rouse him from his blind repose,  How might we meet his searching questionings,Concerning all the follies, wrongs, and woes,  Since his great day whom men call King of Kings,Victorious Agamemnon?  How might weThose large, clear eyes confront, which scornfully  Would view us as a poor, degenerate race,Base-souled and mean-proportioned?  What replyGive to the beauty-loving Greek's heart-cry,  Seeking his ancient gods in vacant space?What should he find within a world grown cold,  Save doubt and trouble?  To his sunny creed  A thousand gloomy, warring sects succeed.How of the Prince of Peace might he be told,  When over half the world the war-cloud lowers?  How would he mock these faltering hopes of ours,Who knows the secret now of death and fate!  Humbly we gaze on the colossal frame,  And mutely we accept the mortal shame,Of men degraded from a high estate.           SIC SEMPER LIBERATORIBUS!                March 13, 1881.As one who feels the breathless nightmare gripHis heart-strings, and through visioned horrors fares,Now on a thin-ledged chasm's rock-crumbling lip,Now on a tottering pinnacle that dareThe front of heaven, while always unawaresWeird monsters start above, around, beneath,Each glaring from some uglier mask of death,So the White Czar imperial progress madeThrough terror-haunted days.  A shock, a cryWhose echoes ring the globe--the spectre's laid.Hurled o'er the abyss, see the crowned martyr lieResting in peace--fear, change, and death gone by.Fit end for nightmare--mist of blood and tears,Red climax to the slow, abortive years.The world draws breath--one long, deep-shuddering sigh,At that which dullest brain prefigured clearAs swift-sure bolt from thunder-threatening sky.How heaven-anointed humblest lots appearBeside his glittering eminence of fear;His spiked crown, sackcloth purple, poisoned cates,His golden palace honey-combed with hates.Well is it done!  A most heroic plan,Which after myriad plots succeeds at lastIn robbing of his life this poor old man,Whose sole offense--his birthright--has but passedTo fresher blood, with younger strength recast.What men are these, who, clamoring to be free,Would bestialize the world to what they be?Whose sons are they who made the snow-wreathed headTheir frenzy's target?  In their Russian veins,What alien current urged on to smite him dead,Whose word had loosed a million Russian chains?What brutes were they for whom such speechless pains,So royally endured, no human thrillAwoke, in hearts drunk with the lust to kill?Not brutes!  No tiger of the wilderness,No jackal of the jungle, bears such brandAs man's black heart, who shrinks not to confessThe desperate deed of his deliberate hand.Our kind, our kin, have done this thing.  We standBowed earthward, red with shame, to see such wrongProrogue Love's cause and Truth's--God knows how long!               DON RAFAEL.      "I would not have," he said,"Tears, nor the black pall, nor the wormy grave,Grief's hideous panoply I would not have      Round me when I am dead.      "Music and flowers and light,And choric dances to guitar and flute,Be these around me when my lips are mute,      Mine eyes are sealed from sight.      "So let me lie one day,One long, eternal day, in sunshine bathed,In cerements of silken tissue swathed,      Smothered 'neath flowers of May.      "One perfect day of peace,Or ere clean flame consume my fleshly veil,My life--a gilded vapor--shall exhale,      Brief as a sigh--and cease.      "But ere the torch be laidTo my unshrinking limbs by some true hand,Athwart the orange-fragrant laughing land,      Bring many a dark-eyed maid      "From the bright, sea-kissed town;My beautiful, beloved enemies,Gemmed as the dew, voluptuous as the breeze,      Each in her festal gown.      "All those through whom I learnedThe sweet of folly and the pains of love,My Rose, my Star, my Comforter, my Dove,      For whom, poor moth, I burned.      "Loves of a day, and hour,Or passions (vowed eternal) of a year,Though each be strange to each, to me all dear      As to the bee the flower.      "Around me they shall moveIn languid contra dances, and shall shedTheir smiling eyebeams as I were not dead,      But quick to flash back love.      "Something not alien quiteTo tender ruth, perchance their breast shall fill,Seeing him that was so mobile grown so still,      The fiery-veined so white.      "And when the dance is o'er,The pinched guitar, the smitten tambourine,Have ceased their rhythmic beat,--oh, friends of mine,      On my rich bier, then pour      "The garlands that ye wear,The happy rose that on your bosom breathes,The fresh-culled clusters and the dewy wreaths      That crown your fragrant hair.      "Though blind, I still shall see,Though dead, shall feel your presence and shall know,I who was beauty's life-long slave, shall so      Win her in death to me.      "Thanks, sisters, and farewell!Back to your joys.  My brother shall make roomFor my tried sword upon the high-piled bloom,      And fire the pinnacle.      "My soul, pure flame, shall leapTo meet its parent essence once againMy body dust and ashes shall remain,      Tired heart and brain shall sleep.      "Life has one gate alone,Obscure, beset with peril and fierce pain.Large death has many portals to his fane,      Why choose we to make moan?      "Why dwell with worms and clayWhen we may soar through air on wings of flame,Dissolve to small, white dust our perfect frame,      And never know decay?      "A brother's pious handThe pure, fire-winnowed ashes shall inurn,And lay them in the orange grove where burn      Globed suns that scent the land.      "The leaf shall be more green,Even for my dust--more snowy-soft the flower,More juicy-sweet the fruit's live pulp--the bower      Richer that I have been.      "For I would not," he said,"Tears and the black pall and the wormy grave,Grief's hideous panoply I would not have      Round me when I am dead."        OFF ROUGH POINT.We sat at twilight nigh the sea,  The fog hung gray and weird.Through the thick film uncannily  The broken moon appeared.We heard the billows crack and plunge,  We saw nor waves nor ships.Earth sucked the vapors like a sponge,  The salt spray wet our lips.Closer the woof of white mist drew,  Before, behind, beside.How could that phantom moon break through,  Above that shrouded tide?The roaring waters filled the ear,  A white blank foiled the sight.Close-gathering shadows near, more near,  Brought the blind, awful night.O friends who passed unseen, unknown!  O dashing, troubled sea!Still stand we on a rock alone,Walled round by mystery.          MATER AMABILIS.Down the goldenest of streams,        Tide of dreams,The fair cradled man-child drifts;Sways with cadenced motion slow,        To and fro,As the mother-foot poised lightly, falls and lifts.He, the firstling,--he, the light        Of her sight,--He, the breathing pledge of love,'Neath the holy passion lies,        Of her eyes,--Smiles to feel the warm, life-giving ray above.She believes that in his vision,        Skies elysianO'er an angel-people shine.Back to gardens of delight,        Taking flight,His auroral spirit basks in dreams divine.But she smiles through anxious tears;        Unborn yearsPressing forward, she perceives.Shadowy muffled shapes, they come        Deaf and dumb,Bringing what? dry chaff and tares, or full-eared sheaves?What for him shall she invoke?        Shall the oakBind the man's triumphant brow?Shall his daring foot alight        On the height?Shall he dwell amidst the humble and the low?Through what tears and sweat and pain,        Must he gainFruitage from the tree of life?Shall it yield him bitter flavor?        Shall its savorBe as manna midst the turmoil and the strife?In his cradle slept and smiled        Thus the childWho as Prince of Peace was hailed.Thus anigh the mother breast,        Lulled to rest,Child-Napoleon down the lilied river sailed.Crowned or crucified--the same        Glows the flameOf her deathless love divine.Still the blessed mother stands,        In all lands,As she watched beside thy cradle and by mine.Whatso gifts the years bestow,        Still men know,While she breathes, lives one who sees(Stand they pure or sin-defiled)        But the childWhom she crooned to sleep and rocked upon her knee.                   FOG.Light silken curtain, colorless and soft,Dreamlike before me floating! what abides        Behind thy pearly veil's        Opaque, mysterious woof?Where sleek red kine, and dappled, crunch day-longThick, luscious blades and purple clover-heads,        Nigh me I still can mark        Cool fields of beaded grass.No more; for on the rim of the globed worldI seem to stand and stare at nothingness.        But songs of unseen birds        And tranquil roll of wavesBring sweet assurance of continuous lifeBeyond this silvery cloud.  Fantastic dreams,        Of tissue subtler still        Than the wreathed fog, arise,And cheat my brain with airy vanishingsAnd mystic glories of the world beyond.        A whole enchanted town        Thy baffling folds conceal--An Orient town, with slender-steepled mosques,Turret from turret springing, dome from dome,        Fretted with burning stones,        And trellised with red gold.Through spacious streets, where running waters flow,Sun-screened by fruit-trees and the broad-leaved palm,        Past the gay-decked bazaars,        Walk turbaned, dark-eyed men.Hark! you can hear the many murmuring tongues,While loud the merchants vaunt their gorgeous wares.        The sultry air is spiced        With fragrance of rich gums,And through the lattice high in yon dead wall,See where, unveiled, an arch, young, dimpled face,        Flushed like a musky peach,        Peers down upon the mart!From her dark, ringleted and bird-poised headShe hath cast back the milk-white silken veil:        'Midst the blank blackness there        She blossoms like a rose.Beckons she not with those bright, full-orbed eyes,And open arms that like twin moonbeams gleam?        Behold her smile on me        With honeyed, scarlet lips!Divine Scheherazade! I am thine.I come!  I come!--Hark! from some far-off mosque        The shrill muezzin calls        The hour of silent prayer,And from the lattice he hath scared my love.The lattice vanisheth itself--the street,        The mart, the Orient town;        Only through still, soft airThat cry is yet prolonged.  I wake to hearThe distant fog-horn peal: before mine eyes        Stands the white wall of mist,        Blending with vaporous skies.Elusive gossamer, imperviousEven to the mighty sun-god's keen red shafts!        With what a jealous art        Thy secret thou dost guard!Well do I know deep in thine inmost folds,Within an opal hollow, there abides        The lady of the mist,        The Undine of the air--A slender, winged, ethereal, lily form,Dove-eyed, with fair, free-floating, pearl-wreathed hair,        In waving raiment swathed        Of changing, irised hues.Where her feet, rosy as a shell, have grazedThe freshened grass, a richer emerald glows:        Into each flower-cup        Her cool dews she distills.She knows the tops of jagged mountain-peaks,She knows the green soft hollows of their sides,        And unafraid she floats        O'er the vast-circled seas.She loves to bask within the moon's wan beams,Lying, night-long upon the moist, dark earth,        And leave her seeded pearls        With morning on the grass.Ah! that athwart these dim, gray outer courtsOf her fantastic palace I might pass,        And reach the inmost shrine        Of her chaste solitude,And feel her cool and dewy fingers pressMy mortal-fevered brow, while in my heart        She poured with tender love        Her healing Lethe-balm!See! the close curtain moves, the spell dissolves!Slowly it lifts: the dazzling sunshine streams        Upon a newborn world        And laughing summer seas.Swift, snowy-breasted sandbirds twittering glanceThrough crystal air.  On the horizon's marge,        Like a huge purple wraith,        The dusky fog retreats.             THE ELIXIR."Oh brew me a potion strong and good!    One golden drop in his wineShall charm his sense and fire his blood,    And  bend his will to  mine."Poor child of passion! ask of me    Elixir of death or sleep,Or Lethe's stream; but love is free,    And woman must wait and weep.               SONG.              Venus.Frosty lies the winter-landscape,  In the twilight golden-green.Down the Park's deserted alleys,  Naked elms stand stark and lean.Dumb the murmur of the fountain,  Birds have flown from lawn and hill.But while yonder star's ascendant,  Love triumphal reigneth still.See the keen flame throb and tremble,  Brightening in the darkening night,Breathing like a thing of passion,  In the sky's smooth chrysolite.Not beneath the moon, oh lover,  Thou shalt gain thy heart's desire.Speak to-night!  The gods are with thee  Burning with a kindred fire.                 SPRING LONGING.   What art thou doing here, O Imagination?  Go   away I entreat thee by the gods, as thou didst   come, for I want thee not.  But thou art come   according to thy old fashion.  I am not angry   with thee--only go away.                            --Marcus AntoninusLilac hazes veil the skies.    Languid sighsBreathes the mild, caressing air.Pink as coral's branching sprays,    Orchard waysWith the blossomed peach are fair.Sunshine, cordial as a kiss,    Poureth blissIn this craving soul of mine,And my heart her flower-cup    Lifteth up,Thirsting for the draught divine.Swift the liquid golden flame    Through my frameSets my throbbing veins afire.Bright, alluring dreams arise,    Brim mine eyesWith the tears of strong desire.All familiar scenes anear    Disappear--Homestead, orchard, field, and wold.Moorish spires and turrets fair    Cleave the air,Arabesqued on skies of gold.Low, my spirit, this May morn,    Outward borne,Over seas hath taken wing:Where the mediaeval town,    Like a crown,Wears the garland of the Spring.Light and sound and odors sweet    Fill the street;Gypsy girls are selling flowers.Lean hidalgos turn aside,    Amorous-eyed,'Neath the grim cathedral towers.Oh, to be in Spain to-day,    Where the MayRecks no whit of good or evil,Love and only love breathes she!    Oh, to be'Midst the olive-rows of Seville!Or on such a day to glide    With the tideOf the berylline lagoon,Through the streets that mirror heaven,    Crystal paven,In the warm Venetian noon.At the prow the gondolier   May not hear,May not see our furtive kiss;But he lends with cadenced strain    The refrainTo our ripe and silent bliss.Golden shadows, silver light,    Burnish brightAir and water, domes and skies;As in some ambrosial dream,    On the streamFloats our bark in magic wise.Oh, to float day long just so!    Naught to knowOf the trouble, toil, and fret!This is love, and this is May:    YesterdayAnd to-morrow to forget!Whither hast thou, Fancy free,    Guided me,Wild Bohemian sister dear?All thy gypsy soul is stirred    Since yon birdWarbled that the Spring was here.Tempt no more!  I may not follow,    Like the swallow,Gayly on the track of Spring.Bounden by an iron fate,    I must wait,Dream and wonder, yearn and sing.                 THE SOUTH.Night, and beneath star-blazoned summer skies  Behold the Spirit of the musky South,A creole with still-burning, languid eyes,  Voluptuous limbs and incense-breathing mouth:        Swathed in spun gauze is she,From fibres of her own anana tree.Within these sumptuous woods she lies at ease,  By rich night-breezes, dewy cool, caressed:'Twixt cypresses and slim palmetto trees,  Like to the golden oriole's hanging nest,        Her airy hammock swings,And through the dark her mocking-bird yet sings.How beautiful she is!  A tulip-wreath  Twines round her shadowy, free-floating hair:Young, weary, passionate, and sad as death,  Dark visions haunt for her the vacant air,        While movelessly she liesWith lithe, lax, folded hands and heavy eyes.Full well knows she how wide and fair extend  Her groves bright-flowered, her tangled everglades,Majestic streams that indolently wend  Through lush savanna or dense forest shades,        Where the brown buzzard fliesTo broad bayou 'neath hazy-golden skies.Hers is the savage splendor of the swamp,  With pomp of scarlet and of purple bloom,Where blow warm, furtive breezes faint and damp,  Strange insects whir, and stalking bitterns boom--        Where from stale waters deadOft looms the great-jawed alligator's head.Her wealth, her beauty, and the blight on these,--  Of all she is aware: luxuriant woods,Fresh, living, sunlit, in her dream she sees;  And ever midst those verdant solitudes        The soldier's wooden cross,O'ergrown by creeping tendrils and rank moss.Was her a dream of empire? was it sin?  And is it well that all was borne in vain?She knows no more than one who slow doth win,  After fierce fever, conscious life again,        Too tired, too weak, too sad,By the new light to be stirred or glad.From rich sea-islands fringing her green shore,  From broad plantations where swart freemen bendBronzed backs in willing labor, from her store  Of golden fruit, from stream, from town, ascend        Life-currents of pure health:Her aims shall be subserved with boundless wealth.Yet now how listless and how still she lies,  Like some half-savage, dusky Indian queen,Rocked in her hammock 'neath her native skies,  With the pathetic, passive, broken mien        Of one who, sorely proved,Great-souled, hath suffered much and much hath loved!But look! along the wide-branched, dewy glade  Glimmers the dawn: the light palmetto-treesAnd cypresses reissue from the shade,  And SHE hath wakened.  Through clear air she sees        The pledge, the brightening ray,And leaps from dreams to hail the coming day.       SPRING STAR.            I.Over the lamp-lit street,Trodden by hurrying feet,Where mostly pulse and beat    Life's throbbing veins,See where the April star,Blue-bright as sapphires are,Hangs in deep heavens far,    Waxes and wanes.Strangely alive it seems,Darting keen, dazzling gleams,Veiling anon its beams,    Large, clear, and pure.In the broad western skyNo orb may shine anigh,No lesser radiancy    May there endure.Spring airs are blowing sweet:Low in the dusky streetStar-beams and eye-beams meet.    Rapt in his dreams,All through the crowded martPoet with swift-stirred heart,Passing beneath, must start,    Thrilled by those gleams.Naught doth he note anear,Fain through Night's veil to peer,Reach that resplendent sphere,    Reading her sign.Where point those sharp, thin rays,Guiding his weary maze,Blesseth she or betrays,    Who may divine?"Guard me, celestial light,Lofty, serenely bright:Lead my halt feet aright,"    Prayerful he speaks."For a new ray hath shoneOver my spirit lone.Be this new soul the one    whom my soul seeks."                 II.Beside her casement oped the maiden sits,  Where the mild evening spirit of the SpringGently between the city's homesteads flits  To kiss her brows, and floats on languid wing,  Vague longings in her breast awakening.While her heart trembles 'neath those dim, deep skies,As the quick sea that 'neath the globed moon lies.Where her eyes rest the full-orbed evening star  Burns with white flame: it beckons, shrinks, dilates.She, dazzled by that shining world afar,  May not withdraw her gaze: breathless she waits.  Some promised joy from Heaven's very gatesUnto her soul seems proffered.  When shall beThe bright fulfilment of that star's decree?Nor glad nor sad is she: she doth not know  That through the city's throng one threads his way,Thrilled likewise by that planet's mystic glow,  And hastes to seek her.  What sweet change shall sway  Her spirit at his coming?  What new rayUpon his shadowy life from her shall fall?The silent star burns on, and knoweth all.          A JUNE NIGHT.Ten o'clock: the broken moon  Hangs not yet a half hour high,    Yellow as a shield of brass,In the dewy air of June,  Poised between the vaulted sky    And the ocean's liquid glass.Earth lies in the shadow still;  Low black bushes, trees, and lawn    Night's ambrosial dews absorb;Through the foliage creeps a thrill,  Whispering of yon spectral dawn    And the hidden climbing orb.Higher, higher, gathering light,  Veiling with a golden gauze    All the trembling atmosphere,See, the rayless disk grows white!  Hark, the glittering billows pause!    Faint, far sounds possess the ear.Elves on such a night as this  Spin their rings upon the grass;    On the beach the water-fayGreets her lover with a kiss;  Through the air swift spirits pass,    Laugh, caress, and float away.Shut thy lids and thou shalt see  Angel faces wreathed with light,    Mystic forms long vanished hence.Ah, too fine, too rare, they be  For the grosser mortal sight,    And they foil our waking sense.Yet we feel them floating near,  Know that we are not alone,    Though our open eyes beholdNothing save the moon's bright sphere,  In the vacant heavens shown,    And the ocean's path of gold.          MAGNETISM.By the impulse of my will,  By the red flame in my blood,By me nerves' electric thrill,  By the passion of my mood,My concentrated desire,  My undying, desperate love,I ignore Fate, I defy her,  Iron-hearted Death I move.When the town lies numb with sleep,  Here, round-eyed I sit; my breathQuickly stirred, my flesh a-creep,  And I force the gates of death.I nor move nor speak--you'd deem  From my quiet face and hands,I were tranced--but in her dream,  SHE responds, she understands.I have power on what is not,  Or on what has ceased to be,From that deep, earth-hollowed spot,  I can lift her up to me.And, or ere I am aware  Through the closed and curtained door,Comes my lady white and fair,  And embraces me once more.Though the clay clings to her gown,  Yet all heaven is in her eyes;Cool, kind fingers press mine eyes,  To my soul her soul replies.But when breaks the common dawn,  And the city wakes--behold!My shy phantom is withdrawn,  And I shiver lone and cold.And I know when she has left,  She is stronger far than I,And more subtly spun her weft,  Than my human wizardry.Though I force her to my will,  By the red flame in my blood,By my nerves' electric thrill,  By the passion of my mood,Yet all day a ghost am I.  Nerves unstrung, spent will, dull brain.I achieve, attain, but die,  And she claims me hers again.          AUGUST MOON.Look! the round-cheeked moon floats high,In the glowing August sky,Quenching all her neighbor stars,Save the steady flame of Mars.White as silver shines the sea,Far-off sails like phantoms be,Gliding o'er that lake of light,Vanishing in nether night.Heavy hangs the tasseled corn,Sighing for the cordial morn;But the marshy-meadows bare,Love this spectral-lighted air,Drink the dews and lift their song,Chirp of crickets all night long;Earth and sea enchanted lie'Neath that moon-usurped sky.To the faces of our friendsUnfamiliar traits she lends--Quaint, white witch, who looketh downWith a glamour all her own.Hushed are laughter, jest, and speech,Mute and heedless each of each,In the glory wan we sit,Visions vague before us flit;Side by side, yet worlds apart,Heart becometh strange to heart.Slowly in a moved voice, then,Ralph, the artist spake again--"Does not that weird orb unrollScenes phantasmal to your soul?As I gaze  thereon, I swear,Peopled grows the vacant air,Fables, myths alone are real,White-clad sylph-like figures steal'Twixt the bushes, o'er the lawn,Goddess, nymph, undine, and faun.Yonder, see the Willis dance,Faces pale with stony glance;They are maids who died unwed,And they quit their gloomy bed,Hungry still for human pleasure,Here to trip a moonlit measure.Near the shore the mermaids play,Floating on the cool, white spray,Leaping from the glittering surfTo the dark and fragrant turf,Where the frolic trolls, and elvesDaintily disport themselves.All the shapes by poet's brain,Fashioned, live for me again,In this spiritual light,Less than day, yet more than night.What a world! a waking dream,All things other than they seem,Borrowing a finer grace,From yon golden globe in space;Touched with wild, romantic glory,Foliage fresh and billows hoary,Hollows bathed in yellow haze,Hills distinct and fields of maize,Ancient legends come to mind.Who would marvel should he find,In the copse or nigh the spring,Summer fairies gambolingWhere the honey-bees do suck,Mab and Ariel and Puck?Ah! no modern mortal seesCreatures delicate as these.All the simple faith has goneWhich their world was builded on.Now the moonbeams coldly glanceOn no gardens of romance;To prosaic senses dull,Baldur's dead, the Beautiful,Hark, the cry rings overhead,'Universal Pan is dead!'""Requiescant!"  Claude's grave toneThrilled us strangely.  "I am oneWho would not restore that Past,Beauty will immortal last,Though the beautiful must die--This the ages verify.And had Pan deserved the nameWhich his votaries misclaim,He were living with us yet.I behold, without regret,Beauty in new forms recast,Truth emerging from the vast,Bright and orbed, like yonder sphere,Making the obscure air clear.He shall be of bards the king,Who, in worthy verse, shall singAll the conquests of the hour,Stealing no fictitious powerFrom the classic types outworn,But his rhythmic line adornWith the marvels of the real.He the baseless feud shall healThat estrangeth wide apartScience from her sister Art.Hold! look through this glass for me?Artist, tell me what you see?""I!" cried Ralph.  "I see in placeOf Astarte's silver face,Or veiled Isis' radiant robe,Nothing but a rugged globeSeamed with awful rents and scars.And below no longer Mars,Fierce, flame-crested god of war,But a lurid, flickering star,Fashioned like our mother earth,Vexed, belike, with death and birth."Rapt in dreamy thought the while,With a sphinx-like shadowy smile,Poet Florio sat, but nowSpake in deep-voiced accents slow,More as one who probes his mind,Than for us--"Who seeks, shall find--Widening knowledge surely bringsVaster themes to him who sings.Was veiled Isis more sublimeThan yon frozen fruit of Time,Hanging in the naked sky?Death's domain--for worlds too die.Lo! the heavens like a scrollStand revealed before my soul;And the hieroglyphs are suns--Changeless change the law that runsThrough the flame-inscribed page,World on world and age on age,Balls of ice and orbs of fire,What abides when these expire?Through slow cycles they revolve,Yet at last like clouds dissolve.Jove, Osiris, Brahma pass,Races wither like the grass.Must not mortals be as godsTo embrace such periods?Yet at Nature's heart remainsOne who waxes not nor wanes.And our crowning glory stillIs to have conceived his will."              SUNRISE.          September 26, 1881.Weep for the martyr!  Strew his bierWith the last roses of the year;Shadow the land with sables; knellThe harsh-tongued, melancholy bell;Beat the dull muffled drum, and flauntThe drooping banner; let the chantOf the deep-throated organ sob--One voice, one sorrow, one heart-throb,From land to land, from sea to sea--The huge world quires his elegy.Tears, love, and honor he shall have,Through ages keeping green his grave.Too late approved, too early lost,His story is the people's boast.Tough-sinewed offspring of the soil,Of peasant lineage, reared to toil,In Europe he had been a thingTo the glebe tethered--here a king!Crowned not for some transcendent gift,Genius of power that may liftA Caesar or a BonaparteUp to the starred goal of his heart;But that he was the epitomeOf all the people aim to be.Were they his dying trust?  He wasNo less their model and their glass.In him the daily traits were viewedOf the undistinguished multitude.Brave as the silent myriads are,Crushed by the juggernaut world-car;Strong with the people's strength, yet mild,Simple and tender as a child;Wise with the wisdom of the heart,Able in council, field, and mart;Nor lacking in the lambent gleam,The great soul's final stamp--the beamOf genial fun, the humor saneWherewith the hero sports with pain.His virtues hold within the spanOf his obscurest fellow-man.To live without reproach, to dieWithout a fear--in these words lieHis highest aims, for none too high.No triumph his beyond the reachOf patient courage, kindly speech;And yet so brave the soul outbreathed,The great example he bequeathed,Were all to follow, we should seeA universal chivalry.His trust, the People!  They respondFrom Maine to Florida, beyondThe sea-walled continent's broad scope,Honor his pledge, confirm his hope.Hark! over seas the echo hence,The nations do him reverence.An Empress lays her votive wreathWhere peoples weep with bated breath.The world-clock strikes a fateful hour,Bright with fair portents, big with power,--The first since history's course has run,When kings' and peoples' cause is one;Those mourn a brother--these a son!O how he loved them!  That gray morn,When his wound-wasted form was borneNorth, from the White House to the sea,Lifting his tired lids thankfully,"How good," he murmured in his pain,"To see the people once again!"Oh, how they loved him!  They stood there,Thronging the road, the street, the square,With hushed lips locked in silent prayer,Uncovered heads and streaming eyes,Breathless as when a father dies.The records of the ghostly ride,Past town and field at morning-tide.When life's full stream is wont to gushThrough all its ways with boisterous rush,--The records note that once a houndHad barked, and once was heard the soundOf cart-wheels rumbling on the stones--And once, mid stifled sobs and groans,One man dared audibly lament,And cried, "God bless the president!"Always the waiting crowds to sendA God-speed to his journey's end--The anxious whisper, brow of gloom,As in a sickness-sacred room,Till his ear drank with ecstasyThe rhythmic thunders of the sea.Tears for the smitten fatherless,The wife's, the mother's life-distress,To whom the million-throated moanFrom throne and hut, may not atoneFor one hushed voice, one empty chair,One presence missing everywhere.But only words of joy and sheer,The people from his grave shall hear.Were they not worthy of his trust,From whose seed sprang the sacred dust?He broke the bars that separateThe humble from the high estate.And heirs of empire round his bedMourn with the "disinherited."Oh, toil-worn, patient Heart that bleeds,Whose martyrdom even his exceeds,Wronged, cursed, despised, misunderstood--Oh, all-enduring multitude,Rejoice! amid you tears, rejoice!There issues from this grave a voice,Proclaiming your long night is o'er,Your day-dawn breaks from shore to shore.You have redeemed his pledge, remainedSecure, erect, and self-sustained,Holding more dear one thing alone,Even than the blood of dearest son,Revering with religious aweThe inviolable might of Law.             A MASQUE OF VENICE.                 (A Dream.)           Not a stain,In the sun-brimmed sapphire cup that is the sky--Not a ripple on the black translucent laneOf the palace-walled lagoon.           Not a cryAs the gondoliers with velvet oar glide by,Through the golden afternoon.           From this heightWhere the carved, age-yellowed balcony o'erjutsYonder liquid, marble pavement, see the lightShimmer soft beneath the bridge,           That abutsOn a labyrinth of water-ways and shutsHalf their sky off with its ridge.           We shall markAll the pageant from this ivory porch of ours,Masques and jesters, mimes and minstrels, while we harkTo their music as they fare.           Scent their flowersFlung from boat to boat in rainbow radiant showersThrough the laughter-ringing air.           See! they come,Like a flock of serpent-throated black-plumed swans,With the mandoline, viol, and the drum,Gems afire on arms ungloved,           Fluttering fans,Floating mantles like a great moth's streaky vansSuch as Veronese loved.           But beholdIn their midst a white unruffled swan appear.One strange barge that snowy tapestries enfold,White its tasseled, silver prow.           Who is here?Prince of Love in masquerade or Prince of Fear,Clad in glittering silken snow?           Cheek and chinWhere the mask's edge stops are of the hoar-frosts hue,And no eyebeams seem to sparkle from withinWhere the hollow rings have place.           Yon gay crewSeem to fly him, he seems ever to pursue.'T is our sport to watch the race.           At his sideStands the goldenest of beauties; from her glance,From her forehead, shines the splendor of a bride,And her feet seem shod with wings,           To entrance,For she leaps into a wild and rhythmic dance,Like Salome at the King's.           'T is his aimJust to hold, to clasp her once against his breast,Hers to flee him, to elude him in the game.Ah, she fears him overmuch!           Is it jest,--Is it earnest? a strange riddle lurks half-guessedIn her horror of his touch.           For each timeThat his snow-white fingers reach her, fades some rayFrom the glory of her beauty in its prime;And the knowledge grows upon us that the dance          Is no play'Twixt the pale, mysterious lover and the fay--But the whirl of fate and chance.           Where the tideOf the broad lagoon sinks plumb into the sea,There the mystic gondolier hath won his bride.Hark, one helpless, stifled scream!           Must it be?Mimes and minstrels, flowers and music, where are ye?Was all Venice such a dream?          AUTUMN SADNESS.Air and sky are swathed in gold    Fold on fold,Light glows through the trees like wine.Earth, sun-quickened, swoons for bliss    'Neath his kiss,Breathless in a trance divine.Nature pauses from her task,    Just to baskIn these lull'd transfigured hours.The green leaf nor stays nor goes,    But it growsRoyaler than mid-June's flowers.Such impassioned silence fills    All the hillsBurning with unflickering fire--Such a blood-red splendor stains    The leaves' veins,Life seems one fulfilled desire.While earth, sea, and heavens shine,    Heart of mine,Say, what art thou waiting for?Shall the cup ne'er reach the lip,    But still slipTill the life-long thirst give o'er?Shall my soul, no frosts may tame,    Catch new flameFrom the incandescent air?In this nuptial joy apart,    Oh my heart,Whither shall we lonely fare?Seek some dusky, twilight spot,    Quite forgotOf the Autumn's Bacchic fire.Where soft mists and shadows sleep,    There outweepBarren longing's vain desire.                  SONNETS.                  ECHOES.Late-born and woman-souled I dare not hope,The freshness of the elder lays, the mightOf manly, modern passion shall alightUpon my Muse's lips, nor may I cope(Who veiled and screened by womanhood must grope)With the world's strong-armed warriors and reciteThe dangers, wounds, and triumphs of the fight;Twanging the full-stringed lyre through all its scope.But if thou ever in some lake-floored caveO'erbrowed by hard rocks, a wild voice wooed and heard,Answering at once from heaven and earth and wave,Lending elf-music to thy harshest word,Misprize thou not these echoes that belongTo one in love with solitude and song.                 SUCCESS.Oft have I brooded on defeat and pain,The pathos of the stupid, stumbling throng.These I ignore to-day and only longTo pour my soul forth in one trumpet strain,One clear, grief-shattering, triumphant song,For all the victories of man's high endeavor,Palm-bearing, laureled deeds that live forever,The splendor clothing him whose will is strong.Hast thou beheld the deep, glad eyes of oneWho has persisted and achieved?  Rejoice!On naught diviner shines the all-seeing sun.Salute him with free heart and choral voice,'Midst flippant, feeble crowds of spectres wan,The bold, significant, successful man.              THE NEW COLOSSUS.*Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,With conquering limbs astride from land to land;Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall standA mighty woman with a torch, whose flameIs the imprisoned lightning, and her nameMother of Exiles.  From her beacon-handGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes commandThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame."Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries sheWith silent lips.  "Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to be free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"*Written in aid of the Bartholdi Pedestal Fund, 1883.             VENUS OF THE LOUVRE.Down the long hall she glistens like a star,The foam-born mother of Love, transfixed to stone,Yet none the less immortal, breathing on.Time's brutal hand hath maimed but could not mar.When first the enthralled enchantress from afarDazzled mine eyes, I saw not her alone,Serenely poised on her world-worshipped throne,As when she guided once her dove-drawn car,--But at her feet a pale, death-stricken Jew,Her life adorer, sobbed farewell to love.Here Heine wept!  Here still we weeps anew,Nor ever shall his shadow lift or move,While mourns one ardent heart, one poet-brain,For vanished Hellas and Hebraic pain.                  CHOPIN.                    I.A  dream of interlinking hands, of feetTireless to spin the unseen, fairy woof,Of the entangling waltz.  Bright eyebeams meet,Gay laughter echoes from the vaulted roof.Warm perfumes rise; the soft unflickering glowOf branching lights sets off the changeful charmsOf glancing gems, rich stuffs, dazzling snowOf necks unkerchieft, and bare, clinging arms.Hark to the music!  How beneath the strainOf reckless revelry, vibrates and sobsOne fundamental chord of constant pain,The pulse-beat of the poet's heart that throbs.So yearns, though all the dancing waves rejoice,The troubled sea's disconsolate, deep voice.                   II.Who shall proclaim the golden fable falseOf Orpheus' miracles?  This subtle strainAbove our prose-world's sordid loss and gainLightly uplifts us.  With the rhythmic waltz,The lyric prelude, the nocturnal songOf love and languor, varied visions rise,That melt and blend to our enchanted eyes.The Polish poet who sleeps silenced long,The seraph-souled musician, breathes againEternal eloquence, immortal pain.Revived the exalted face we know so well,The illuminated eyes, the fragile frame,Slowly consuming with its inward flame,We stir not, speak not, lest we break the spell.                    III.A voice was needed, sweet and true and fineAs the sad spirit of the evening breeze,Throbbing with human passion, yet divineAs the wild bird's untutored melodies.A voice for him 'neath twilight heavens dim,Who mourneth for his dead, while round him fallThe wan and noiseless leaves.  A voice for himWho sees the first green sprout, who hears the callOf the first robin on the first spring day.A voice for all whom Fate hath set apart,Who, still misprized, must perish by the way,Longing with love, for that they lack the artOf their own soul's expression.  For all theseSing the unspoken hope, the vague, sad reveries.                     IV.Then Nature shaped a poet's heart--a lyreFrom out whose chords the lightest breeze that blowsDrew trembling music, wakening sweet desire.How shall she cherish him?  Behold! she throwsThis precious, fragile treasure in the whirlOf seething passions; he is scourged and stung,Must dive in storm-vext seas, if but one pearlOf art or beauty therefrom may be wrung.No pure-browed pensive nymph his Muse shall be,An amazon of thought with sovereign eyes,Whose kiss was poison, man-brained, worldly-wise,Inspired that elfin, delicate harmony.Rich gain for us!  But with him is it well?The poet who must sound earth, heaven, and hell!             SYMPHONIC STUDIES.          (After Robert Schumann.)                  Prelude.Blue storm-clouds in hot heavens of mid-July  Hung heavy, brooding over land and sea:  Our hearts, a-tremble, throbbed in harmonyWith the wild, restless tone of air and sky.Shall we not call him Prospero who held  In his enchanted hands the fateful key  Of that tempestuous hour's mystery,And with him to wander by a sun-bright shore,  To hear fine, fairy voices, and to flyWith disembodied Ariel once more  Above earth's wrack and ruin?  Far and nighThe laughter of the thunder echoed loud,And harmless lightnings leapt from cloud to cloud.                     I.Floating upon a swelling wave of sound,  We seemed to overlook an endless sea:  Poised 'twixt clear heavens and glittering surf were we.We drank the air in flight: we knew no boundTo the audacious ventures of desire.  Nigh us the sun was dropping, drowned in gold;  Deep, deep below the burning billows rolled;And all the sea sang like a smitten lyre.Oh, the wild voices of those chanting waves!  The human faces glimpsed beneath the tide!Familiar eyes gazed from profound sea-caves,  And we, exalted, were as we had died.We knew the sea was Life, the harmonious cryThe blended discords of humanity.                     II.Look deeper yet: mark 'midst the wave-blurred mass,  In lines distinct, in colors clear defined,  The typic groups and figures of mankind.Behold within the cool and liquid glassBright child-folk sporting with smooth yellow shells,  Astride of dolphins, leaping up to kiss  Fair mother-faces.  From the vast abyssHow joyously their thought-free laughter wells!  Lulled by the overwhelming water's sound,And some make mouths at dragons, undismayed.  Oh dauntless innocence!  The gulfs profoundReecho strangely with their ringing glee,And with wise mermaids' plaintive melody.                     III.What do the sea-nymphs in that coral cave?  With wondering eyes their supple forms they bend  O'er something rarely beautiful.  They lendTheir lithe white arms, and through the golden waveThey lift it tenderly.  Oh blinding sight!  A naked, radiant goddess tranced in sleep,  Full-limbed, voluptuous, 'neath the mantling sweepOf auburn locks that kiss her ankles white!Upward they bear her, chanting low and sweet:  The clinging waters part before their way,Jewels of flame are dancing 'neath their feet.  Up in the sunshine, in soft foam, they layTheir precious burden, and return forlorn.Oh, bliss! oh, anguish!  Mortals, LOVE is born!                     IV.Hark! from unfathomable deeps a dirge  Swells sobbing through the melancholy air:  Where Love has entered, Death is also there.The wail outrings the chafed, tumultuous surge;Ocean and earth, the illimitable skies,  Prolong one note, a mourning for the dead,  The cry of souls not to be comforted.What piercing music!  Funeral visions rise,And send the hot tears raining down our cheek.  We see the silent grave upon the hill  With its lone lilac-bush.  O heart, be still!She will not rise, she will not stir nor speak.Surely, the unreturning dead are blest.Ring on, sweet dirge, and knell us to our rest!                     V.Upon the silver beach the undines dance  With interlinking arms and flying hair;  Like polished marble gleam their limbs left bare;Upon their virgin rites pale moonbeams glance.Softer the music! for their foam-bright feet  Print not the moist floor where they trip their round:  Affrighted they will scatter at a sound,Leap in their cool sea-chambers, nimbly fleet,And we shall doubt that we have ever seen,  While our sane eyes behold stray wreaths of mist,  Shot with faint colors by the moon-rays kissed,Floating snow-soft, snow-white, where these had been.Already, look! the wave-washed sands are bare,And mocking laughter ripples through the air.                  Epilogue.Forth in the sunlit, rain-bathed air we stepped,  Sweet with the dripping grass and flowering vine,  And saw through irised clouds the pale sun shine.Back o'er the hills the rain-mist slowly creptLike a transparent curtain's slivery sheen;  And fronting us the painted bow was arched,  Whereunder the majestic cloud-shapes marched:In the wet, yellow light the dazzling greenOf lawn and bush and tree seemed stained with blue.  Our hearts o'erflowed with peace.  With smiles we spakeOf partings in the past, of courage new,  Of high achievement, of the dreams that makeA wonder and a glory of our days,And all life's music but a hymn of praise.             LONG ISLAND SOUND.I see it as it looked one afternoonIn August,--by a fresh soft breeze o'erblown.The swiftness of the tide, the light thereon,A far-off sail, white as a crescent moon.The shining waters with pale currents strewn,The quiet fishing smacks, the Eastern cove,The semi-circle of its dark, green grove.The luminous grasses, and the merry sunIn the grave sky; the sparkle far and wide,Laughter of unseen children, cheerful chirpOf crickets, and low lisp of rippling tide,Light summer clouds fantastical as sleepChanging unnoted while I gazed thereon.All these fair sounds and sights I made my own.                   DESTINY.                    1856.Paris, from throats of iron, silver, brass,Joy-thundering cannon, blent with chiming bells,And martial strains, the full-voiced paean swells.The air is starred with flags, the chanted massThrongs all the churches, yet the broad streets swarmWith glad-eyed groups who chatter, laugh, and pass,In holiday confusion, class with class,And over all the spring, the sun-floods warm!In the Imperial palace that March morn,The beautiful young mother lay and smiled;For by her side just breathed the Prince, her child,Heir to an empire, to the purple born,Crowned with the Titan's name that stirs the heartLike a blown clarion--one more Bonaparte.                    1879.Born to the purple, lying stark and dead,Transfixed with poisoned spears, beneath the sunOf brazen Africa!  Thy grave is one,Fore-fated youth (on whom were visitedFollies and sins not thine), whereat the world,Heartless howe'er it be, will pause to singA dirge, to breathe a sigh, a wreath to flingOf rosemary and rue with bay-leaves curled.Enmeshed in toils ambitious, not thine own,Immortal, loved boy-Prince, thou tak'st thy standWith early doomed Don Carlos, hand in handWith mild-browed Arthur, Geoffrey's murdered son.Louis the Dauphin lifts his thorn-ringed head,And welcomes thee, his brother, 'mongst the dead.         FROM ONE AUGUR TO ANOTHER.So, Calchas, on the sacred Palatine,Thou thought of Mopsus, and o'er wastes of seaA flower brought your message.  I divine(Through my deep art) the kindly mockeryThat played about your lips and in your eyes,Plucking the frail leaf, while you dreamed of home.Thanks for the silent greeting!  I shall prize,Beyond June's rose, the scentless flower of Rome.All the Campagna spreads before my sight,The mouldering wall, the Caesars' tombs unwreathed,Rome and the Tiber, and the yellow light,Wherein the honey-colored blossom breathed.But most I thank it--egoists that we be!For proving then and there you thought of me.           THE CRANES OF IBYCUS.There was a man who watched the river flowPast the huge town, one gray November day.Round him in narrow high-piled streets at playThe boys made merry as they saw him go,Murmuring half-loud, with eyes upon the stream,The immortal screed he held within his hand.For he was walking in an April landWith Faust and Helen.  Shadowy as a dreamWas the prose-world, the river and the town.Wild joy possessed him; through enchanted skiesHe saw the cranes of Ibycus swoop down.He closed the page, he lifted up his eyes,Lo--a black line of birds in wavering threadBore him the greetings of the deathless dead!                 CRITIC AND POET.                   An Apologue.("Poetry must be simple, sensuous, or impassioned;this man is neither simple, sensuous, nor impassioned;therefore he is not a poet.")No man had ever heard a nightingale,When once a keen-eyed naturalist was stirredTo study and define--what is a bird,To classify by rote and book, nor failTo mark its structure and to note the scaleWhereon its song might possibly be heard.Thus far, no farther;--so he spake the word.When of a sudden,--hark, the nightingale!Oh deeper, higher than he could divineThat all-unearthly, untaught strain!  He sawThe plain, brown warbler, unabashed.  "Not mine"(He cried) "the error of this fatal flaw.No bird is this, it soars beyond my line,Were it a bird, 't would answer to my law."           ST. MICHAEL'S CHAPEL.When the vexed hubbub of our world of gainRoars round about me as I walk the street,The myriad noise of Traffic, and the beatOf Toil's incessant hammer, the fierce strainOf struggle hand to hand and brain to brain,Ofttimes a sudden dream my sense will cheat,The gaudy shops, the sky-piled roofs retreat,And all at once I stand enthralled againWithin a marble minster over-seas.I watch the solemn gold-stained gloom that creepsTo kiss an alabaster tomb, where sleepsA lady 'twixt two knights' stone effigies,And every day in dusky glory steepsTheir sculptured slumber of five centuries.              LIFE AND ART.Not while the fever of the blood is strong,The heart throbs loud, the eyes are veiled, no lessWith passion than with tears, the Muse shall blessThe poet-soul to help and soothe with song.Not then she bids his trembling lips expressThe aching gladness, the voluptuous pain.Life is his poem then; flesh, sense, and brainOne full-stringed lyre attuned to happiness.But when the dream is done, the pulses fail,The day's illusion, with the day's sun set,He, lonely in the twilight, sees the paleDivine Consoler, featured like Regret,Enter and clasp his hand and kiss his brow.Then his lips ope to sing--as mine do now.                SYMPATHY.Therefore I dare reveal my private woe,The secret blots of my imperfect heart,Nor strive to shrink or swell mine own desert,Nor beautify nor hide.  For this I know,That even as I am, thou also art.Thou past heroic forms unmoved shalt go,To pause and bide with me, to whisper low:"Not I alone am weak, not I apartMust suffer, struggle, conquer day by day.Here is my very cross by strangers borne,Here is my bosom-sun wherefrom I prayHourly deliverance--this my rose, my thorn.This woman my soul's need can understand,Stretching o'er silent gulfs her sister hand."              YOUTH AND DEATH.What hast thou done to this dear friend of mine,Thou cold, white, silent Stranger?  From my handHer clasped hand slips to meet the grasp of thine;Here eyes that flamed with love, at thy commandStare stone-blank on blank air; her frozen heartForgets my presence.  Teach me who thou art,Vague shadow sliding 'twixt my friend and me.  I never saw thee till this sudden hour.What secret door gave entrance unto thee?  What power in thine, o'ermastering Love's own power?                AGE AND DEATH.Come closer, kind, white, long-familiar friend,  Embrace me, fold me to thy broad, soft breast.Life has grown strange and cold, but thou dost bend  Mild eyes of blessing wooing to my rest.So often hast thou come, and from my sideSo many hast thou lured, I only bideThy beck, to follow glad thy steps divine.  Thy world is peopled for me; this world's bare.  Through all these years my couch thou didst prepare.Thou art supreme Love--kiss me--I am thine!               CITY VISIONS.                    I.As the blind Milton's memory of light,The deaf Beethoven's phantasy of tone,Wrought joys for them surpassing all things knownIn our restricted sphere of sound and sight,--So while the glaring streets of brick and stoneVex with heat, noise, and dust from morn till night,I will give rein to Fancy, taking flightFrom dismal now and here, and dwell aloneWith new-enfranchised senses.  All day long,Think ye 't is I, who sit 'twixt darkened walls,While ye chase beauty over land and sea?Uplift on wings of some rare poet's song,Where the wide billow laughs and leaps and falls,I soar cloud-high, free as the the winds are free.                     II.Who grasps the substance? who 'mid shadows strays?He who within some dark-bright wood reclines,'Twixt sleep and waking, where the needled pinesHave cushioned all his couch with soft brown sprays?He notes not how the living water shines,Trembling along the cliff, a flickering haze,Brimming a wine-bright pool, nor lifts his gazeTo read the ancient wonders and the signs.Does he possess the actual, or do I,Who paint on air more than his sense receives,The glittering pine-tufts with closed eyes behold,Breathe the strong resinous perfume, see the skyQuiver like azure flame between the leaves,And open unseen gates with key of gold?                  INFLUENCE.The fervent, pale-faced Mother ere she sleep,Looks out upon the zigzag-lighted square,The beautiful bare trees, the blue night-air,The revelation of the star-strewn deep,World above world, and heaven over heaven.Between the tree-tops and the skies, her sightRests on a steadfast, ruddy-shining light,High in the tower, an earthly star of even.Hers is the faith in saints' and angels' power,And mediating love--she breathes a prayerFor yon tired watcher in the gray old tower.He the shrewd, skeptic poet unawareFeels comforted and stilled, and knows not whenceFalls this unwonted peace on heart and sense.                RESTLESSNESS.*Would I had waked this morn where Florence smiles,A-bloom with beauty, a white rose full-blown,Yet rich in sacred dust, in storied stone,Precious past all the wealth of Indian isles--From olive-hoary Fiesole to feedOn Brunelleschi's dome my hungry eye,And see against the lotus-colored sky,Spring the slim belfry graceful as a reed.To kneel upon the ground where Dante trod,To breathe the air of immortalityFrom Angelo and Raphael--TO BE--Each sense new-quickened by a demi-god.To hear the liquid Tuscan speech at whiles,From citizen and peasant, to beholdThe heaven of Leonardo washed with gold--Would I had waked this morn where Florence smile!*Written before visiting Florence.

Time, about 1655.ACT. I.SCENE I.  The studio of the Spagnoletto. RIBERA at work before his canvas.  MARIA seated some distance behind him; a piece of embroidery is  in her hands, but she glances up from it incessantly toward her  father with impatient movements.MARIA.Father!(RIBERA, absorbed in his work, makes no reply; she puts by herembroidery, goes toward him and kisses him gently. He starts,looks up at her, and returns her caress).RIBERA.My child!MARIA.          Already you forget,Oh, heedless father!  Did you not promise meTo lay aside your brush to-day at noon,And tell me the great secret?RIBERA.          Ah, 't is true,I am to blame.  But it is morning yet;My child, wait still a little.MARIA.         'T is morning yet!Nay, it was noon one mortal hour ago.All patience I have sat till you should turnAnd beckon me.  The rosy angels breatheUpon the canvas; I might sit till night,And, if I spake not, you would never glanceFrom their celestial faces.  Dear my father,Your brow is  moist, and yet your hands are ice;Your very eyes are tired--pray, rest awhile.The Spagnoletto need no longer toilAs in the streets of Rome for beggars' fare;Now princes bide his pleasure.RIBERA (throws aside his brush and palette).         Ah, Maria,Thou speak'st in season.  Let me ne'er forgetThose days of degradation, when I starvedBefore the gates of palaces.  The germsStirred then within me of the perfect fruitsWherewith my hands have since enriched God's world.Vengeance I vowed for every moment's sting--Vengeance on wealth, rank, station, fortune, genius.See, while I paint, all else escapes my sense,Save this bright throng of phantasies that pressUpon my brain, each claiming from my handIts immortality.  But thou, my child,Remind'st me of mine oath, my sacred pride,The eternal hatred lodged within my breast.Philip of Spain shall wait.  I will not deignTo add to-day the final touch of lifeUnto this masterpiece.MARIA.         So! that is well.Put by the envious brush that separatesFather from daughter.  Now you are all mine own.And now--your secret.RIBERA.         Mine?  'T is none of mine;'T is thine, Maria.  John of AustriaDesires our presence at his ball to-night.MARIA.Prince John?RIBERA.         Ay, girl, Prince John.  I looked to seeA haughty joy dance sparkling in thine eyesAnd burn upon thy cheek.  But what is this?Timid and pale, thou droop'st thy head abashedAs a poor flower-girl whom a lord accosts.MARIA.Forgive me.  Sure, 't is you Don John desiresThe prince of artists--RIBERA.         Art!  Prate not of art!Think'st thou I move an artist 'midst his guests?As such I commune with a loftier race;Angels and spirits are my ministers.These do I part aside to grace his halls;A Spanish gentleman--and so, his peer.MARIA.Father, I am not well; my head throbs fast,Unwonted languor weighs upon my frame.RIBERA.Anger me not, Maria.  'T is my will,Thou shalt obey.  Hell, what these women be!No obstacle would daunt them in the questOf that which, freely given, they reject.Hold!  Haply just occasion bids thee seemUnlike thyself.  Speak fearlessly child;Confide to me thy knowledge, thy surmise.MARIA (hurriedly).No, father, you were right.  I have no cause;Punish me--nay, forgive, and I obey.RIBERA.There spake my child; kiss me and be forgiven.Sometimes I doubt thou playest upon my loveWillfully, knowing me as soft as clay,Whom the world knows of marble.  In such moods,I see my spirit mirror's first, and thenFrom thy large eyes thy sainted mother's soulUnclouded shine.MARIA.         Can I be like to her?I only knew her faded, white, and grave,And so she still floats vaguely through my dreams,With eyes like your own angels', and a browWorthy an aureole.RIBERA.         An earthly crown,My princess, might more fitly rest on thine.Annicca hath her colors, blue-black hair,And pale, brown flesh, and gray, untroubled eyes;Yet thou more often bring'st her to mind,For all the tawny gold of thy thick locks,Thy rare white face, and brilliant Spanish orbs.Thine is her lisping trick of voice, her laugh,The blithest music still this side of heaven;Thine her free, springing gait, though therewithalA swaying, languid motion all thine own,Recalls Valencia more than Italy.Like and unlike thou art to her, as stillMy memory loves to hold her, as she firstBeamed like the star of morning on my life.Hot, faint, and footsore, I had paced since dawnThe sun-baked streets of Naples, seeking work,Not alms, despite the beggar that I looked.Now 't was nigh vespers, and my suit had metWith curt refusal, sharp rebuff, and gibes.Praised be the saints! for every drop of gallIn that day's brimming cup, I have upheldA poisoned beaker to another's lips.Many a one hath the Ribera taughtTo fare a vagabond through alien streets;A god unrecognized 'midst churls and clowns,With kindled soul aflame, and body faintOr lack of bread.  Domenichino knows,And Gessi, Guido, Annibal Caracci--MARIA.Dear father, calm yourself.  You had begunTo tell me how you saw my mother first.RIBERA.True, I forgot it not.  Why, I AM calm;The old man now can well be grave and cold,Or laugh at his own youth's indignities,Past a long lifetime back.  'T was vespers' hour,Or nigh it, when I reached her father's door.Kind was his greeting, the first cordial wordsI heard in Naples; but I took small heedOf speech or toe, for all my sense was raptIn wonder at the angel by his sideWho smiled upon me.  Large, clear eyes that heldThe very soul of sunlight in their depths;Low, pure, pale brow, with masses of black hairFlung loosely back, and rippling unconfinedIn shadowy magnificence belowThe slim gold girdle o'er the snow-soft gown.Vested and draped about her throat and waist and wrists,A stately lily ere the dew of mornHath passed away--such was thy mother, child.MARIA.Would I were like her!  But what said she, father?How did she plead for you?RIBERA.         Ah, cunning child,I see thy tricks; thou humorest my age,Knowing how much I love to tell this tale,Though thou hast heard it half a hundred times.MARIA.I find it sweet to hear as you to tell,Believe me, father.RIBERA.         'T was to pleasure her,Signor Cortese gave me all I lackedTo prove my unfamed skill.  A savage pride,Matched oddly with my rags, the haughtinessWherewith I claimed rather than begged my tools,And my quaint aspect, oft she told me since,Won at a glance her faith.  Before I left,She guessed my need, and served me meat and wineWith  her own flower-white hands.  The parting graceI craved was granted, that my work might beThe portrait of herself.  Thou knowest the rest.MARIA.Why did she leave us, father?  Oh, how oftI yearn to see her face, to hear her voice,Hushed in an endless silence!  Strange that she,Whose rich love beggared our return, should bearSuch separation!  Though engirdled nowBy heavenly hosts of saints and seraphim,I cannot fancy it.  What! shall her child,Whose lightest sigh reechoed in her heart,Have need of her and cry to her in vain?RIBERA.Now, for God's sake, Maria, speak not thus;Let me not see such tears upon thy cheek.Not unto us it has been given to guessThe peace of disembodied souls like hers.The vanishing glimpses that my fancies catchThrough heaven's half-opened gates, exalt even me,Poor sinner that I am.  And what are these,The painted shadows that make all my lifeA glory, to the splendor of that light?For thee, my child, has not my doting loveSufficed, at least in part, to fill the breachOf that tremendous void?  What dost thou lack?What help, what counsel, what most dear caress?What dost thou covet?  What least whim remainsUngratified, because not yet expressed?MARIA.None, none, dear father!  Pardon me!  Thy love,Generous and wise as tender, shames my powerTo merit or repay.  Fie o my lips!Look if they be not blistered.  Let them smoothWith contrite kisses the last frown away.We must be young to-night--no wrinkles then!Genius must show immortal as she is.RIBERA.Thou wilt unman me with thy pretty ways.I had forgot the ball.  Yea, I grow old;This scanty morning's work has wearied me.Once I had thought it play to dream all dayBefore my canvas and then dance till dawn,And now must I give o'er and rest at noon.[Rises.]  Enter LUCA, ushering in LORENZO, who carries a portfolio.LUCA.Signor Lorenzo.[LORENZO ceremoniously salutes RIBERA and MARIA.  Exit LUCA.]LORENZO.         Master, I bring my sketch.[Opens his portfolio and hands a sketch to RIBERA.]RIBERA.Humph! the design is not so ill-conceived;I note some progress; but your drawing's bad--Yes, bad, sir.  Mark you how this leg hangs limp,As though devoid of life; these hands seem clenched,Not loosely clasped, as you intended them.[He takes his pencil and makes a few strokes.Thus should it stand--a single line will mend.And here, what's this?  Why, 't is a sloven's work.You dance too many nights away, young gallant.You shirk close labor as do all your mates.You think to win with service frivolous,Snatched 'twixt your cups, or set between two kisses,The favor of the mistress of the world.LORENZO.Your pardon, master, but you do me wrong.Mayhap I lack the gift.  Alas, I fear it!But not the patience, not the energyOf earnest, indefatigable toil,That help to make the artist.RIBERA.         'S death!  He daresBelie me, and deny the testimonyOf his own handiwork, whose every lineBetrays a sluggard soul, an indolent will,A brain that's bred to idleness.  So be it!Master Lorenzo tells the SpagnolettoHis own defects and qualities!  'T were bestHe find another teacher competentTo guide so apt, so diligent a scholar.MARIA.Dear father, what hath given thee offence?Cast but another glance upon the sketch;Surely it hath some grace, some charm, some promise.RIBERA.Daughter, stand by!  I know these insolent slipsOf young nobility; they lack the stuffThat makes us artists.  What! to answer me!When next I drop a hint as to his colors,The lengthening or the shortening of a stroke,He'll bandy words with me about his error,To prove himself the master.LORENZO.         If my defectBe an hereditary grain i' the blood,Even as you say, I must abide by it;But if patrician habits more than birthBeget such faults, then may I dare to hope.Not mine, I knew, I felt, to clear new paths,To win new kingdoms; yet were I contentWith such achievement as a strenuous will,A firm endeavor, unfaltering love,And an unwearying spirit might attain.Cast me not lightly back.  Banish me notFrom this, my home of hope, of inspiration!MARIA.What, my ungentle father!  Will you hear,And leave this worthy signor's suit unanswered?RIBERA.Well, he may bide.  Sir, I will speak with youAnon upon this work.  I judged in haste.Yea, it hath merit.  I am weary now;To-morrow I shall be in fitter moodTo give you certain hints.[LORENZO bows his thanks and advances to address MARIA.  RIBERAsilences and dismisses him with a wave of the hand.  Exit LORENZO.]RIBERA.         Should I o'ersleepMine hour, Maria, thou must awaken me;But come what may, I will be fresh to-night,To triumph in thy triumph.[Exit RIBERA.]MARIA (alone).         Could I have told,Then when he bade me?  Nay, what is to tell?He had flouted me for prizing at such heightHomage so slight from John of Austria, even.A glance exchanged, a smile, a fallen flowerDropped from my hair, and pressed against his lips.The Prince! my father gloats upon that name.Were he no more than gentleman, I thinkI should be glad.  I cannot tell to-dayIf I be sad or gay.  Now could I weepWarm, longing tears; anon, a fire of joyLeaps in my heart and dances through my veins.Why should I nurse such idle thoughts?  TonightWe are to meet again.  Will he remember?--Nay, how should he forget?  His heart is young;His eyes do mirror loyalty.  Oh, day!Quicken thy dull, slow round of tedious hours!God make me beautiful this happy night!My father's sleeping saint rebukes my thought.Strange he has left his work, against his wont,Revealed before completed.  I will drawThe curtain.[She stands irresolute before the picture with her hand on thecurtain.]         Beautiful, oh, beautiful!The far, bright, opened heavens--the dark earth,Where the tranced pilgrim lies, with eyelids sealed,His calm face flushed with comfortable sleep,His weary limbs relaxed, his heavy headPillowed upon the stone.  Oh, blessed dreamThat visits his rapt sense, of airy forms,Mounting, descending on the shining ladder,With messages of peace.  I will be trueUnto my lineage divine, and breatheThe passion of just pride that overfillsHIS soul inspired.  While she stands before the canvas, reenter, unperceived by  her, LORENZO.LORENZO.         Oh, celestial vision!What brush may reproduce those magic tints,Those lines ethereal?--MARIA (turns suddenly).         Is it not marvellous,Signor Lorenzo?  I would draw the curtain,But, gazing, I forgot.         You are the first,After the master and myself, to lookUpon this wonder.LORENZO (with enthusiasm, looking for he first time at the picture).         Ah, what an answer thisFor envious minds that would restrict his powerTo writhing limbs and shrivelled flesh!  Repose,Beauty, and large simplicity are here.Yes, that is art!  Before such work I standAnd feel myself a dwarf.MARIA.         There, you are wrong.My father even, who knows his proper worth,Before his best achievements I have seenIn like dejection; 't is the curse of genius.Oft have I heard the master grace your nameWith flattering addition.LORENZO.         'T is your goodness,And not the echo of his praise, that speaks.My work was worthless--'t was your generous voiceAlone secured the master's second glance.MARIA.Nay, signor, frankly, he esteems your talent.Because you are of well-assured meansAnd gentle birth, he will be rude to you.Not without base is the deep grudge he owesTo riches and prosperity.LORENZO.         Signora,Why do I bear such harsh, injurious termsAs he affronts me with?  Why must I seemIn mine own eyes a craven?  Spiritless,Dishonorably patient?  'T is not his fame,His power, his gift, his venerable yearsThat bind me here his willing slave.  Maria,'T is thou, 't is thou alone! 'T is that I love thee,And exile hence is death![A pause.  He kneels at her feet.  She looks at him kindly butmakes no reply.]         At thy dear feetI lay my life with its most loyal service,The subject of thy pleasure.MARIA (tenderly).         You are too humble.LORENZO.Too humble!  Do you seek mine utter ruin,With words whose very tone is a caress?I say all.  I love you!--you have known it.Why should I tell you?  Yet, to-day you seemOther than you have been.  A milder lightBeams from your eyes--a gentler grace is thronedUpon your brow--your words fall soft as dewTo melt my fixed resolve.MARIA.         You find me, signor,In an unguarded mood.  I would be trueTo you; and to myself; yet, know no answer.Anon, I will be calm; pray you withdraw.LORENZO.Till when?  Remember what mad hopes and fearsMeantime will riot in my brain.MARIA.         To-morrow--Farewell, farewell.LORENZO (kisses her hand).         Farewell.[Exit.]MARIA.         A faithful heart,A name untainted, a fair home--yea, theseAre what I need.  Oh, lily soul in heaven,Who wast on earth my mother, guide thy child!  While MARIA sits rapt in thought, enter from behind her, ANNICCA,  who bends over her and kisses her brow.ANNICCA.What, sister! lost in dreams by daylight?  Fie!Who is the monarch of thy thoughts?MARIA (starting).         Annicca!My thoughts are bounden to no master yet;They fly from earth to heaven in a breath.Now are they all of earth.  Hast heard the tidings?ANNICCA.Yea--of the Prince's ball?  We go together.Braid in thy hair our mother's pearls, and wearThe amulet ingemmed with eastern stones;'T will bring good fortune.MARIA.         Tell me, ere we go,What manner of man is John of Austria?ANNICCA.Scarce man at all--a madcap, charming boy;Well-favored--you have seen him--exquisiteIn courtly compliment, of simple manners;You may not hear a merrier laugh than hisFrom any boatman on the bay; well-versedIn all such arts as most become his station;Light in the dance as winged-foot Mercury,Eloquent on the zither, and a masterOf rapier and--MARIA.         A puppet could be madeTo answer in all points your praise of him.Hath he no substance as of a man?ANNICCA.         Why, sister,What may that be to us?MARIA.         He is our Prince.ANNICCA.The promise of his youth is to outstripThe hero of Lepanto; bright and boldAs fire, he is the very soul, the starOf Spanish chivalry; his last achievementSeems still the flower of his accomplishments.Musician, soldier, courtier, yea, and artist."He had been a painter, were he not a prince,"Says Messer Zurbaran.  The Calderona,His actress-mother, hath bequeathed to himHer spirit with her beauty, and the powerTo win and hold men's hearts.MARIA.         I knew it, sister!His eye hath a command in it; his browSeems garlanded with laurel.ANNICCA.         What is this?You kindle with his praise, your whole heart glowsIn light and color on your face, your wordsTake wing and fly as bold as reckless birds.What! can so rash a thought, a dream so wild,So hopeless an ambition, tempt your soul?MARIA.Pray you, what thought, what dream, and what ambition?I knew not I had uttered any such.ANNICCA.Nor have you in your speech; your eyes now veiled,Where the light leaped to hear me voice his fame,Your blushes and your pallor have betrayedThat which should lie uncounted fathom deep--The secret of a woman's foolish heart.MARIA.And there it lies, my sibyl sister, still!Your plummet hath not reached it.  Yes, 't is loveFlaunts his triumphant colors in my cheek,And quickens my lame speech--but not for him,Not for the Prince--so may I vaunt his worthWith a free soul.ANNICCA.         Say on.MARIA.         A gentleman,Favored of earth and heaven, true and loving,Hath cast his heart at my imperial feet;And if to-morrow find me as to-day,I will e'en stoop and raise it to mine own.ANNICCA.Signor Vitruvio?MARIA.         Not he, indeed!Did not I say favored of earth and heaven?That should mean other gifts than bags of gold,Or a straight-featured mask.  Nor will it beAny you name, though you should name him right.Must it not lie--how many fathom deep--The secret of a woman's foolish heart?ANNICCA.Kiss me, Maria.  You are still a child.You cannot vex me, wilful as you be.Your choice, I fear not, doubtless 't will prove wise,Despite your wild wit, for your heart is pure,And you will pause with sure deliberate judgmentBefore you leave our father.MARIA.         Does love stealSo gently o'er our soul?  What if he comeA cloud, a fire, a whirlwind, to o'erbearThe feeble barriers wherewith we oppose him,And blind our eyes and wrest from us our reason?Fear not, Annicca, for in no such guiseHe visits my calm breast; but yet you speakSomewhat too sagely.  Did such cautious wisdomGuide your own fancy?ANNICCA.         Jest no more, Maria.Since I became a wife, is much made clear,Which a brief year ago was dark and vague.Tommaso loves me--we are happierThen I had dreamed; yet matching now with then,I see his love is not that large, rich passionOur father bore us.MARIA.         You regret your home?ANNICCA.No, no!  I have no wish and no regret.I speak for you.  His is a sovereign soul,And all his passions loom in huger shapeThan lesser men's.  He brooks no rivalryWith his own offspring, and toward me his loveHath ebbed, I mark, to a more even flow,While deeper, stronger, sets the powerful currentToward you alone.  Consider this, Maria,Nor wantonly discrown that sacred headOf your young love to wreathe some curled boy's brow.MARIA.Think you his wish were that I should not wed?ANNICCA.Nay, that I say not, for his pride aspiresTo see you nobly mated.MARIA (after a pause).         Him will I wedWhose name is ancient, fair, and honorable,As the Ribera's is illustrious--Him who no less than I will venerateThat white, divine old head.  In art his pupil,In love his son; tender as I to watch,And to delay the slow extinguishingOf that great light.ANNICCA.         There spake his darling child!MARIA.What is't o'clock?  If he should sleep too late--He bade me rouse him--ANNICCA.         Haste to seek him, then.'T is hard on sunset, and he looks for theeWith his first waking motion.  Till to-night.[Exeunt severally.]SCENE II.  A hall in RIBERA'S house.  Enter LUCA and FIAMETTA.FIAMETTA.But did you see her?LUCA.Nay, I saw her sister, Donna Annicca.FIAMETTA.Tush, man! never name her beside my lady Maria-Rosa.  You have lostthe richest feast in the world for hungry eyes.  Her gown of clotho' silver clad her, as it were, with light; there twinkled abouther waist a girdle stiff with stones--you would have said theybreathed.  Mine own hands wreathed the dropping pearls in her hair,and pearls again were clasped around her throat.  But no, I mighttell thee every ornament--her jeweled fan, her comb of pearls, herfloating veil of gauze, and still the best of all would escape us.LUCA.Thou speakest more like her page than her handmaiden.FIAMETTA.Thou knowest not woman truly, for all thy wit.  I speak most like awoman when I weigh the worth of beauty and rich apparel.  Heigh-ho!I have felt the need of this.  Thou, good Luca, who might havebeen my father, canst understand me?  HE was poor as thou.  Whyshouldst thou be his lackey, his slave?  My hand were as dainty ashers, if it could but be spared its daily labor.LUCA.Yes, poor child, I understand thee, and yet thou art wrong.  He ismore slave to pride than I am to him.  I know him well, Fiametta, after so many years of service, and to-day I pity him more than Ifear him.  Why, girl, my task is sport beside his toil!  If mylimbs be weary, I sleep; but I have seen him sit before his canvaswith straining eyes and the big beads standing on his brow.  Whenat last he gave o'er, and I have smoothed his pillow, and servedand soothed him, what sleep could he snatch?  His brain is hauntedwith evil visions, whereof some be merely of his own imaginings,and others the phantoms of folk who are living or have lived, andwho rouse his jealousy or mayhap his remorse, God only knows!  Ifthat be genius--to be alive to pain at every pore, to be possessedof a devil that robs you of your sleep and grants no space betweenthe hours of grinding toil--I thank the saints I am a simple man!FIAMETTA.I grant thee thou mayst be right concerning him; he hath indeed a strange, sour mien.  I shudder when he turns suddenly, as his wontis, and bends his evil eyes on me.  The holy father tells me suchwarnings come from God.  No matter how slight the service he asksof me, my flesh creeps and my limbs refuse to move, till I havewhispered an Ave.  But what of Lady Maria-Rosa?  Both heaven andearth smile upon her.  To-night she wears a poor girl's dowry, aseparate fortune, on her head, her neck, her hands, yes, on herlittle jeweled feet.  One tiny shoe of hers would make me free towed my lad.LUCA.If he have but eyes, I warrant thee he finds jewels enough in thybright face.  Tell me his name.FIAMETTA.Nay, that is my secret.LUCA.He must be a poor-souled lad if he will wait till thou hast earneda dowry.FIAMETTA.A poor-souled lad! my good Vicenzo--ah! but no matter; thou knowesthim, Luca, my Lord Lorenzo's page.  There!--is he poor, or mean, orplain, or dull?  He claims no dowry, he--but I have my pride, as wellas the great ones.LUCA.May the saints preserve thee from such as theirs!  I am heartily gladof thy good fortune.  I am not sure whether thou or Lady Marie-Rosabe the most favored.  Well, the end proves all.[Exeunt.]  Enter on one side ANNICCA and DON TOMMASO, attired for the ball;  on the other side, RIBERA.RIBERA.What do ye here, my children?  Haste away!Maria waits you for the ball; folk say'T will be the bravest show e'er seen in Naples.I warrant you the Spagnoletto bringsThe richest jewels--what say'st thou, my son?DON TOMMASO.I who have robbed you of one gem, need scarceRe-word, sir, how I prize it.RIBERA.         Why, 't is true.Robbed me, thou sayst?  So hast thou.  She was mine--The balanced beauty of her flesh and spirit,That was my garland, and I was her all,Till thou, a stranger, stole her heart's allegiance,Suborned--Forgive me, I am old, a father,Whose doting passions blind.  I am not jealous,Believe me, sir.  When we Riberas give,We give without retraction or reserve,Were it our life-blood.  I rejoice with theeThat she is thine; nor am I quite bereft,I have some treasure still.  I do repentSo heartily of my discourteous speech,That I will crave your leave before I kissYour wife's soft palm.ANNICCA (kissing him repeatedly).         Why, father, what is this?Can Don Tommaso's wife so soon forgetShe is the Spagnoletto's child?RIBERA.         Enough.I can bear praise, thou knowest, from all save theeAnd my Maria.  My grave son, I fear,Will mock these transports.  Pray go in with me.No one of us but has this night a triumph.Let us make ready.[Exeunt.]ACT II.SCENE I.  Ball in the Palace of DON JOHN.  Dance.  DON JOHN and MARIA  together. DON TOMMASO, ANNICCA.  LORDS and LADIES, dancing or  promenading.1st LORD.Were it not better to withdraw awhile,After our dance, unto the torch-lit gardens?The air is fresh and sweet without.1st LADY.         Nay, signor.I like this heavy air, rich with warm odors,The broad, clear light, the many-colored throng.I might have breathed on mine own balconyThe evening breeze.1st LORD.         Still at cross purposes.When will you cease to flout me?1st LADY.         When I prizeA lover's sigh more dear than mine own pleasure.See, the Signora Julia passed again.She is far too pale for so much white, I find.Donna Aurora--ah, how beautiful!That spreading ruff, sprinkled with seeds of gold,Becomes her well.  Would you believe it, sir,Folk say her face is twin to mine--what think you?1st LORD.For me, the huge earth holds but one such face.You know it well.1St LADY.         The hall is overfilled;Go we without.[They pass on.]2d LADY.         Thrice he hath danced with her.She is not one of us--her face is strange;Colored and carven to meet most men's desire--Is't not, my lord?  Certes, it loses naughtFor lack of ornament.  Pray, ask her name,If but for my sake.2d LORD.         I have already asked.She is the daughter to the Spagnoletto,Maria-Rosa.2d LADY.         Ah, I might have guessed.The form and face are matched with the apparel,As in a picture.  'T was the master's hand,I warrant you, arranged with such quaint art,Such seeming-careless care, the dead, white pearlsWithin her odd, bright hair.[They pass on.]DON JOHN.          Now hope, now fearReigned lord of my wild dreams.  One name still sangLike the repeated strain of some caged bird,Its sweet, persistent music through my brain.One vanishing face upon the empty airShone forth and faded night and day.  And you,Did you not find me hasty, over-bold?Nay, tell me all your thought.MARIA.         You know, my lord,I am no courtier, and belike my thoughtMight prove too rustic for a royal ear.DON JOHN.         Speak on, speak on!Though you should rail, your voice would still outsingRebeck and mandoline.MARIA.         Is it not strange?I knew you not, albeit I might have guessed,If only from the simple garb of black,And golden collar, 'midst the motley huesOf our gay nobles.  I know not what besides,But this first won me.  Be not angered, sir;But, as I looked, I never ranked you higherThan simple gentleman.  I asked your name;Then, when you Highness stooped to pick my flower,My lord, that moment was my thought a traitor,For it had fain discrowned you.DON JOHN.         May God's angelsReward such treason.  Say me those words again.Let the rich blush born of that dear confessionAgain dye cheek and brow, and fade and meltForever, even as then.MARIA.We are watched, my lord.This is no place, no hour, for words like these.DON JOHN.When, where then, may we meet?[They pass on.]SCENE II.  The Palace Gardens.  Interrupted sounds of music and revelry  come though the open windows of the ball-room, seen in the  background.  RIBERA, pacing the stage, occasionally pausing  to look in upon the dancers.RIBERA.This is revenge.  Is she not beautiful,Ye gods?  The beggar's child matched with a prince!Throb not so high, my heart, 'neath envious eyesFixed on thy triumph!  Now am I well repaidFor my slow, martyred years.  Was I not wrungby keener tortures than my savage brush,Though dipped in my heart's blood, might reproduce!No twisted muscle, no contorted limb,No agony of flesh, have I yet drawn,That owed not its suggestion to some pangOf my  pride crucified, my spirit racked,My entrails gnawed by the blind worm of hate,Engendered of oppression.  That is past,But not forgotten; though to-night I pleaseTo yield to gentler influence, to ownThe strength of beauty and the power of joy,And welcome gracious phantasies that throngAnd hover over me in airy shapes.The spirits of earth and heaven contend to-nightFor mastery within me; ne'er beforeHave I been more the Spagnoletto, firedWith noble wrath, with the consuming feverAnd fierce delight of vengeance.         From this pointI see her clearly--the auroral faceA-light with smiles, the imperial head upraised;Her languid hand sways the broad, silken fan,Whose wing-like movement stirs above her browThe fine, bright curls, as though warm airs of heavenAround her breathed.  He leads her 'midst the throng.So, they have gone; but I will follow them,And watch them from afar.[Exit.]  Enter from the opposite side DON JOHN and MARIA.DON JOHN.         I dread to askWhat quivers on my lips.  My heart is free,But thine?MARIA.My heart is free, my lord.DON JOHN.         Thank God!MARIA.It never beat less calmly at the soundOf any voice till now.  I laugh to thinkThis very morn I fancied it had metIts master.DON JOHN.         Ah!MARIA.         Fear naught--a simple boy,A pupil of my father's.DON JOHN.         I was madTo dream it could be otherwise.  Forgive me;I, a mere stranger in they life, am jealousOf all thy present and thy past.MARIA.         Listen, my lord;You shall hear all.  What hour, think you, he choseTo urge his cause?  The same wherein I learnedYour Highness had commanded for to-nightOur presence.  My winged thoughts were flying backTo Count Lodovico's; again I saw you,My white rose at your lips, your grave eyes fixedMost frankly, yet most reverently, on mine.Again my heart sank as I heard the name,The Prince of Austria; and while I mused,He spake of love.  Oh, I am much to blame!My mood was soft;--although I promised naught,I listened, yea, I listened.  Good, my lord,Do you not pity him?DON JOHN.         Thanks, and thanks again,For thy confession!  Now no spot remainsOn the unblemished mirror of my faith.Since that dear night, I with one only thoughtHave gained the sum of knowledge and opinionsTouching thine honored father, with such scrapsAs the gross public voice could dole to meConcerning thine own far-removed, white life.Thou art, I learn, immured in close seclusion;Thy father, be it with all reverence said,Hedges with jealous barriers his treasure;Whilst thou, most duteous, tenderest of daughters,Breath'st but for him.MARIA.         Dear father!  Were it so,'T were simple justice.  Ah, if you knew him--A proud, large, tameless heart.  This is the cloisterWhere he immures me--Naples' gayest revels;The only bar wherewith he hedges meIs his unbounded trust, that leaves me free.Let us go in; the late night air is chill.DON JOHN.Yet one more dance?MARIA.   You may command, my lord.[Exeunt.]  Enter RIBERA.RIBERA.I lost them in the press.  Ah, there they danceAgain together.  I would lay my handsIn blessing on that darling, haughty head.Like the Ribera's child, she bears her honorsAs lightly as a flower.  Yet there glowsUnwonted lustre in her starry eyes,And richer beauty blushes on her cheek.Enough.  Now must I strive to fix that formThat haunts my brain--the blind, old Count Camillo,The Prince's oracle. 'Midst the thick throngMy fancy singled him; white beard, white hair,Sealed eyes, and brow lit by an inward light.So will I paint mine Isaac blessing Esau,While Jacob kneels before him--blind, betrayedBy his own flesh!  As RIBERA stands aside, lost in thought, enter DON JOHN and MARIA.MARIA.         See the impatient dayWakes in the east.DON JOHN.         One moment here, signora,Breathe we the charm of this enchanted night.Look where behind yon vines the slow moon sets,Hidden from us, while every leaf hangs black,Each tender stalk distinct, each curling edgeAgainst the silver sky.MARIA (perceiving RIBERA).         What, father! here?RIBERA.Maria!--Ah, my Prince, I crave your pardon.When thus I muse, 't is but my mind that lives;Each outward sense is dead.  I saw you not,I heard nor voice nor footstep.  Yonder linesThat streak the brightening sky east warn us away.For all your grace to us, the SpagnolettoProffers his thanks to John of Austria.My daughter, art thou ready?DON JOHN.         I am bound,Illustrious signor, rather unto youAnd the signora, past all hope of payment.When may I come to tender my poor homageTo the Sicilian master?RIBERA.         My lord will jest.Our house is too much honored when he deignsO'erstep the threshold.  Let your royal pleasureAlone decide the hour.DON JOHN.         To-morrow, then.Or I should say to-day, for dawn is nigh.RIBERA.And still we trespass.  Be it as you will;We are your servants.MARIA.          So, my lord, good-night.[Exeunt MARIA and RIBERA.]DON JOHN (alone).Gods, what a haughty devil rules that man!As though two equal princes interchangedImperial courtesies!  The SpagnolettoThanks John of Austria!  Louis of FranceMight so salute may father.  By heaven, I know notWhat patience or what reverence withheldMy enchafed spirit in bounds of courtesy.Nay, it was she, mine angel, whose mere aspectIs balm and blessing.  How her love-lit eyesBurned through my soul!  How her soft hand's slight pressureTingled along my veins!  Oh, she is worthyA heart' religion!  How shall I wear the hoursEre I may seek her?  Lo, I stand and dream,While my late guests await me.  Patience, patience![Exeunt.]SCENE III.  Morning twilight in RIBERA'S Garden.  During this scene the day  gradually breaks, and at the close the full light of morning  illuminates the stage.  LORENZO.  AUBADE.LORENZO (sings).  From thy poppied sleep awake;    From they golden dreams arise;  Earth and seas new colors take,    Love-light dawns in rosy skies,Weird night's fantastic shadows are outworn;Why tarriest thou, oh, sister to the morn?  Hearken, love! the matin choir    Of birds salutes thee, and with these  Blends the voice of my desire.    Unto no richer promisesOf deeper, dearer, holier love than mine,Canst thou awaken from they dreams divine.  Lo, thine eastern windows flame,    Brightening with the brightened sky;  Rise, and with thy beauty shame    Morning's regal pageantry,To thrill and bless as the reviving sun,For my heart gropes in doubt, though night be gone.(He speaks.)Why should I fear?  Her soul is pledged to mine,Albeit she still withheld the binding word.How long hath been the night! but morn breathes hope."I fain were true to you and to myself"--Did she say thus? or is my fevered brainThe fool of its desires?  The world swam;The blood rang beating in mine ears and roaredLike rushing waters; yet, as through a dream,I saw her dimly.  Surely on her lidsShone the clear tears.  As there's a God in heaven,She spake those words!  My lips retain the touchOf those soft, snow-cold hands, neither refusedNor proffered.  Such things ARE, nor can they beForgotten or foreknown.  Yes, she is mine.But soft!  Her casement opes.  Oh, joy, 't is she!Pale, in a cloud of white she stands and drinksThe morning sunlight.MARIA (above at the window).         Ah, how sweet this airKisses my sleepless lids and burning temples.I am not weary, though I found no rest.My spirit leaps within me; a new gloryBlesses the dear, familiar scene--ripe orchard,The same--yet oh, how different!  Even I thoughtSoft music trembled on the listening air,As though a harp were touched, blent with low song.Sure, that was phantasy.  I will descend,Visit my flowers, and see whereon the dewHangs heaviest, and what fairest bud hath bloomedSince yester-eve.  Why should I court reposeAnd dull forgetfulness, while the large earthWakes no lesser joy than mine?[Exit from above.]LORENZO.         Oh, heart!How may my breast contain thee, with thy burdenOf too much happiness?  Enter MARIA below; LORENZO springs forward to greet her; she  shrinks back in a sort of terror.LORENZO.         Good-day, sweet mistress.May the blithe spirit of this auspicious mornBecome the genius of thy days to come,Whereof be none less beautiful than this.Why art thou silent?  Does not love inspireJoyous expression, be it but a sigh,A song, a smile, a broken word, a cry?Thou hast not granted me the promised pledgeFor which I hunger still.  I would confirmWith dear avowals, frequent seals of love,That which, though sure, I yet can scarce believe.MARIA.Somewhat too sure, I think, my lord Lorenzo.I scarce deemed possible that one so shyBut yester-morn should hold so high a mien,Claiming what ne'er was given.LORENZO.         Maria!MARIA.         Sir,You are a trifle bold to speak my nameFamiliarly as no man, save my fatherOr my own brother, dares.LORENZO.         Ah, now I seeYour jest.  You will not seem so lightly wonWithout a wooing?  You will feign disdain,Only to make more sweet your rich concession?Too late--I heard it all.  "A new light shinesOn the familiar scene."  What may that be,Save the strange splendor of the dawn of love?Nay, darling, cease to jest, lest my poor heart,Hanging 'twixt hell and heaven, in earnest break.MARIA.Here is no jest, sir, but a fatal error,Crying for swift correction.  You surprise meWith rude impatience, ere I have found timeTo con a gentle answer.  Pardon meIf any phrase or word or glance of mineHath bred or nourished in your heart a hopeThat you might win my love.  It cannot be.LORENZO.A word, a glance!  Why, the whole frozen statueWarmed into life.  Surely it was not you.You must have bribed some angel with false prayersTo wear your semblance--nay, no angel served,But devilish witchcraft--MARIA.         Sir, enough, enough!I hoped to find here peace and solitude.These lacking, I retire.  Farewell.[Going toward the house.]LORENZO.         Signora,I will not rob you of your own.  Farewell to you.[Exit.]MARIA.Where have you flown, bright dreams?  Has that rude handSufficed to dash to naught your frail creations?Sad thoughts and humors black now fill my soul.So his rough foot hath bruised the dewy grass,And left it sere.  Why should his harsh words touch me?The truth of yesterday is false to-day.How could I know, dear God!  How might I guessThe bitter sweetness, the delicious pain!A new heart fills my breast, as soft and weakAnd melting as a tear, unto its lord;But kindled with quick courage to endure,If I need front for him, a world of foes.If this be love, ah, what a hell is theirsWho suffer without hope!  Even I, who holdSo many dear assurances, who hearStill ringing in mine ears such sacred vows,Am haunted with an unaccustomed doubt,Not wonted to go hand-in-hand with joy.A gloomy omen greets me with the morn;I, who recoil from pain, must strike and wound.What may this mean?  Help me, ye saints of heavenAnd holy mother, for my strength is naught!  She falls on her knees and bursts into tears.  Reenter LORENZO.LORENZO (aside).Thank heaven, I came.  How have I wrung her soul!A noble love, forsooth! A blind, brute passion,That being denied, is swift transformed to hateNo whit more cruel.  (To Maria.)  Lady!MARIA (rising hastily).         Signor Lorenzo!Again what would you with me?LORENZO.         No such suitAs late I proffered, but your gracious pardon.MARIA.Rise, sir, forgiven.  I, too, have been to blame,Although less deeply than you deemed.  ForbearTo bind your life.  I feel myself unworthyOf that high station where your thoughts enthrone me.Yet I dare call myself your friend.[Offering him her hand, which LORENZO presses to his lips.]LORENZO.         Thanks, thanks!Be blessed, and farewell.[Exit.]  Enter RIBERA, calling.RIBERA.         Daughter! Maria!MARIA.Why, father, I am here (kissing him).  Good-day.  What will you?RIBERA.Darling, no more than what I always will.Before I enter mine own world removed,I fain would greet the dearest work of God.I missed you when I rose.  I sought you firstIn your own chamber, where the lattice, oped,Let in the morning splendor and smellsOf the moist garden, with the sound of voices.I looked, I found you here--but not alone.What man was that went from you?MARIA.         Your disciple,My lord Lorenzo.  You remember, father,How yester-morn I pleaded for his work;Thus he, through gratitude and--love, hath watchedAll night within our garden, while I danced;And when I came to nurse my flowers--he spake.RIBERA.And you?MARIA.         Am I not still beside you, father?I will not leave you.RIBERA.         Ah, mine angel-child!I cannot choose but dread it, though I waitExpectant of the hour when you fulfilYour woman's destiny.  You have full freedom;Yet I rejoice at this reprieve, and thank theeFor thy brave truthfulness.  Be ever thus,Withholding naught from him whose heart reflectsOnly thine image.  Thou art still my pride,Even as last night when all eyes gazed thy way,Thy bearing equal in disdainful graceTo his who courted thee--thy sovereign's son.MARIA.Yea, so?  And yet it was not pride I felt,Nor consciousness of self, nor vain delightIn the world's envy;--something more than these,Far deeper, sweeter--What have I said?  My brainIs dull with sleep.  'T is only now I feelThe weariness of so much pleasure.RIBERA (rising).         Well,Go we within.  Yes, I am late to work;We squander precious moments.  Thou, go rest,And waken with fresh roses in they cheeks,To greet our royal guest.[Exeunt.]ACT III.SCENE I.  The studio of the Spagnoletto.  RIBERA before his canvas.  LUCA  in attendance.RIBERA (laying aside his brush).So! I am weary.  Luca, what 's o'clock?LUCA.My lord, an hour past noon.RIBERA.         So late already!Well, one more morning of such delicate toilWill make it ready for Madrid, and worthyNot merely Philip's eyes, but theirs whose glanceOutvalues a king's gaze, my noble friendVelasquez, and the monkish Zurbaran.Luca!LUCA.   My lord.RIBERA.         Hath the signora risen?LUCA.Fiametta passed a brief while since, and leftMy lady sleeping.RIBERA.         Good! she hath found rest;Poor child, she sadly lacked it.  She had known'Twixt dawn and dawn no respite from emotion;Her chill hand fluttered like a bird in mine;Her soft brow burned my lips.  Could that boy readThe tokens of an overwearied spirit,Strained past endurance, he had spared her still,At any cost of silence.  What is such loveTo mine, that would outrival Roman heroes--Watch mine arm crisp and shrivel in quick flame,Or set a lynx to gnaw my heart away,To save her from a needle-prick of pain,Ay, or to please her?  At their worth she ratesHer wooers--light as all-embracing airOr universal sunshine.  Luca, goAnd tell Fiametta--rather, bid the lassHither herself.[Exit Luca.]         He comes to pay me homage,As would his royal father, if he pleasedTo visit Naples; yet she too shall see him.She is part of all I think, of all I am;She is myself, no less than yon bright dreamFixed in immortal beauty on the canvas.  Enter FIAMETTA.FIAMETTA.My lord, you called me?RIBERA.         When thy mistress wakes,Array her richly, that she be preparedTo come before the Prince.FIAMETTA.         Sir, she hath risen,And only waits me with your lordship's leave,To cross the street unto St. Francis' church.RIBERA (musingly).With such slight escort?  Nay, this troubles me.Only the Strada's width?  The saints forbidThat I should thwart her holy exercise!Myself will go.  I cannot.  Bid her muffle,Like our Valencian ladies, her silk mantleAbout her face and head.[At a sign from RIBERA, exit FIAMETTA.]         Yes, God will bless her.What should I fear?  I will make sure her beautyIs duly masked.[He goes toward the casement.]         Ay, there she goes--the mantle,Draped round the stately head, discloses naughtSave the live jewel of the eye.  Unless one guessedFrom the majestic grace and proud proportions,She might so pass through the high thoroughfares.Ah, one thick curl escapes from its black prison.Alone in Naples, wreathed with rays of gold,Her crown of light betrays her.  So, she's safe!  Enter LUCA.LUCA.A noble gentleman of Spain awaitsThe master's leave to enter.RIBERA.        Show him in.[Exit LUCA.  RIBERA draws the curtain before his picture of"Jacob's Dream."]RIBERA.A gentleman of Spain!  Perchance the PrinceSends couriers to herald his approach,Or craves a longer grace.  Enter LUCA, ushering in DON JOHN unattended, completely enveloped  in a Spanish mantle, which he throws off, his face almost hidden  by a cavalier's hat.  He uncovers his head on entering.  RIBERA,  repressing a movement of surprise, hastens to greet him and kisses  his hand.RIBERA.         Welcome, my lord!I am shamed to think my sovereign's son should wait,Through a churl's ignorance, without my doors.DON JOHN.Dear master, blame him not.  I came attendedBy one page only.  Here I blush to claimSuch honor as depends on outward pomp.No royalty is here, save the crowned monarchOf our Sicilian artists.  Be it mineTo press with reverent lips my master's hand.RIBERA.Your Highness is too gracious; if you glanceRound mine ill-furnished studio, my worksShall best proclaim me and my poor deserts.Luca, uplift you hangings.DON JOHN (seating himself).         Sir, you may sit.RIBERA (aside, seating himself slowly).Curse his swollen arrogance!  Doth he imagineI waited leave of him?(Luca uncovers the picture).DON JOHN.         Oh, wonderful!You have bettered here your best.  Why, sir, he breathes!Will not those locked lids ope?--that nerveless handRegain the iron strength of sinew matedWith such heroic frame?  You have conspiredWith Nature to produce a man.  Behold,I chatter foolish speech; for such a marvelThe fittest praise is silence.[He rises and stands before the picture.]RIBERA (after a pause).         I am gladYour highness deigns approve.  Lose no more time,Lest the poor details should repay you not.Unto your royal home 't will follow you,Companion, though unworthy, to the treasuresOf the Queen's gallery.DON JOHN.         'T is another jewelSet in my father's crown, and, in his name,I thank you for it.[RIBERA bows silently.  DON JOHN glances around the studio.]DON JOHN.         There hangs a quaint, strong head,Though merely sketched.  What a marked, cunning leerGrins on the wide mouth! what a bestial glance!RIBERA.'T is but a slight hint for my larger work,"Bacchus made drunk by Satyrs."DON JOHN.         Where is that?I ne'er have seen the painting.RIBERA.         'T is not in oils,But etched in aqua-fortis.  Luca, fetch downYonder portfolio.  I can show your HighnessThe graven copy.[LUCA brings forward a large portfolio.  RIBERA looks hastilyover the engravings and draws one out which he shows to DON JOHN.]DON JOHN.         Ah, most admirable!I know not who is best portrayed--the god,Plump, reeling, wreathed with vine, in whom abidesSomething Olympian still, or the coarse Satyrs,Thoroughly brutish.  Here I scarcely miss,So masterly the grouping, so distinctThe bacchanalian spirit, your rich brush,So vigorous in color.  Do you findThe pleasure in this treatment equals thatOf the oil painting?RIBERA.         All is in my mood;We have so many petty talents, cleverTo mimic Nature's surface.  I name notThe servile copyists of the greater masters,Or of th' archangels, Raphael and Michael;But such as paint our cheap and daily marvels.Sometimes I fear lest they degrade our artTo a nice craft for plodding artisans--Mere realism, which they mistake for truth.My soul rejects such limits.  The true artistGives Nature's best effects with far less means.Plain black and white suffice him to expressA finer grace, a stronger energyThan she attains with all the aid of color.I argue thus and work with simple tools,Like the Greek fathers of our art--the sculptors,Who wrought in white alone their matchless types.Then dazzled by the living bloom of earth,Glowing with color, I return to that,My earliest worship, and compose such workAs you see there.[Pointing to the picture.]DON JOHN.         Would it be overmuch,In my brief stay in Naples, to beg of youA portrait of myself in aqua-fortis?'T would rob you, sir, of fewer golden hoursThan the full-colored canvas, and enrichWith a new treasure our royal gallery.RIBERA.You may command my hours and all that's mine.DON JOHN (rising).Thanks, generous master.  When may I returnFor the first sitting?RIBERA.         I am ready now--To-day, to-morrow--when your Highness please.DON JOHN.'T would be abuse of goodness to acceptThe present moment.  I will come to-morrow,At the same hour, in some more fitting garb.Your hand, sir, and farewell.  Salute for me,I pray you, the signora.  May I not hopeTo see and thank her for her grace to me,In so adorning my poor feast?RIBERA.         The debt is ours.She may be here to-morrow--she is free,She only, while I work, to come and go.Pray, sir, allow her--she is never crossed.I stoop to beg for her--she is the lastWho bides with me--I crave you pardon, sir;What should this be to you?DON JOHN.         'T is much to me,Whose privilege has been in this rare hour,Beneath the master to discern the man,And thus add friendship unto admiration.[He presses RIBERA'S hand and is about to pick up his mantle andhat.  LUCA springs forward, and, while he is throwing the cloakaround the Princes's shoulders, enter hastily MARIA,  enveloped inher mantilla, as she went to church.]MARIA.Well, father, an I veiled and swathed to suit you,To cross the Strada?[She throws off her mantilla and appears all in white.  She goesto embrace her father, when she suddenly perceives the Prince, andstands speechless and blushing.]RIBERA.         Child, his Royal HighnessPrince John of Austria.DON JOHN.         Good-day, signora.Already twice my gracious stars have smiled.I saw you in the street.  You wore your mantle,As the noon sun might wear a veil of cloud,Covering, but not concealing.MARIA.         I, sir, twiceHave unaware stood in your royal presence.You are welcome to my father's home and mine.I scarce need crave your pardon for my entrance;Yourself must see how well assured I feltMy father was alone.DON JOHN.         And so you hopedTo find him--shall I read your answer thus?RIBERA.Nay, press her not.  Your Highness does her wrong,So harshly to construe her simpleness.My daughter and myself are one, and bothWill own an equal pleasure if you bide.DON JOHN (seating himself).You chain me with kind words.MARIA.         My father, sir,Hath surely told you our delight and marvelAt the enchantments of your feast.  For meThe night was brief, rich, beautiful, and strangeAs a bright dream.DON JOHN.         I will gainsay you not.A beauteous soul can shed her proper gloryOn mean surroundings.  I have likewise dreamed,Nor am I yet awake.  This morn hath beenA feast for mind and eye.  Yon shepherd-prince,Whom angels visit in his sleep, shall crownYour father's brow with a still fresher laurel,And link in equal fame the Spanish artistWith the Lord's chosen prophet.RIBERA.         That may be,For in the form of that wayfarerI drew myself.  So have I slept beneathThe naked heavens, pillowed by a stone,With no more shelter than the wind-stirred branches,While the thick dews of our Valencian nightsDrenched my rude weeds, and chilled through blood and bone.Yet to me also were the heavens revealed,And angels visited my dreams.DON JOHN.         How strangeThat you, dear masters, standing on the crownOf a long life's continuous ascent,Should backward glance unto such dark beginnings.RIBERA.Obscure are all beginnings.  Yet I museWith pleasing pain on those fierce years of struggle.They were to me my birthright; all the vigor,The burning passion, the unflinching truth,My later pencil gained, I gleaned from them.I prized them.  I reclaimed their ragged freedom,Rather than hold my seat, a liveried slave,At the rich board of my Lord Cardinal.A palace was a prison till I rearedMine own.  But now my child's heart I would pierceSooner than see it bear the least of ills,Such as I then endured.DON JOHN.         Donna MariaMay smile, sir, at your threat; she is in a pleasance,Where no rude breezes blow, no shadow fallsDarker than that of cool and fragrant leaves.Yea, were it otherwise--had you not reapedThe fruit of your own works, she had not suffered.Your children are Spain's children.RIBERA.         Sir, that wordIs the most grateful you have spoken yet.Why are thou silent, daughter?MARIA (absently).         What should I say?The Prince is kind.  I scarcely heard your words.I listened to your voices, and I mused.DON JOHN (rising).I overstep your patience.MARIA.         You will be gone?What have I said?RIBERA.         You are a child, Maria.To-morrow I will wait your Highness.DON JOHN.         Thanks.To-morrow noon.  Farewell, signora.[Exit DON JOHN.]RIBERA.What ails you, daughter?  You forget yourself.Your tongue cleaves to your mouth.  You sit and muse,A statue of white silence.  Twice to-dayYou have deeply vexed me.  Go not thus againAcross the street with that light child, Fiametta.Faith, you were closely muffled.  What was this--This tell-tale auburn curl that rippled downOver the black mantilla?  Were I harsh,Suspicious, jealous, fearful, prone to wrath,Or anything of all that I am not,I should have deemed it no mere negligence,But a bold token.MARIA.         Father you make me quail.Why do you threat me with such evil eyes?Would they could read my heart!RIBERA.         Elude me not.Whom have you met beside the Prince this morn?Who saw you pass?  Whom have you spoken with?MARIA.For God's sake, father, what strange thoughts are these?With none, with none!  Beside the Prince, you say?Why even him I saw not, as you know.I hastened with veiled eyes cast on the ground,Swathed in my mantle still, I told my beads,And in like manner hasted home to you.RIBERA.Well, it may pass; but henceforth say thy matinsIn thine own room.  I know what vague cloudObscures my sight and weighs upon my brain.I am very weary. Luca, follow me.[Exeunt RIBERA and LUCA.]MARIA.Poor father!  Dimly he perceives some troubleWithin the threatening air.  Thank heaven, I calmed him,Yet I spake truth.  What could have roused so soonHis quick suspicion?  Did Fiametta seeThe wary page slip in my hand the missive,As we came forth again?  Nay, even so,My father hath not spoken with her since.Sure he knows naught; 't is but my foolish fearMakes monsters out of shadows.  I may readThe priceless lines and grave them on my heart.[She draws from her bosom a letter, reads it, and presses it toher lips.]He loves me, yes, he loves me!  Oh, my God,This awful joy in mine own breast is love!To-night he will await me in our garden.Oh, for a word, a pressure of the hand!I fly, my prince, at thy most dear behest![Exit.]SCENE II.  A room in DON TOMMASO'S HOUSE.  DON TOMMASO and ANNICCA.DON TOMMASO.Truly, you wrong your sister; she is young,Heedless, and wilful, that is all; a touchOf the Ribera's spirit fired the lass.Don John was but her weapon of revengeAgainst the malice of our haughty matrons,Who hurled this icy shafts of scorn from heightsOf dignity upon the artist's daughter.ANNICCA.I cannot think with you.  In her demeanor,Her kindled cheek, her melting eye, was moreThan sly revenge or cautious policy.If that was art, it overreached itself.Ere the night ended, I had blushed to seeSlighting regards cast on my father's child,And hear her name and his tossed lightly round.DON TOMMASO.Could you not read in such disparagementThe envy of small natures?ANNICCA.         I had as liefMaria were to dance the tarantellaUpon the quay at noonday, as to see herGazed at again with such insulting homage.DON TOMMASO.You are too strict; your baseless apprehensionsWrong her far more than strangers' jests.ANNICCA.         Not so;My timely fears prevent a greater illAnd work no harm, since they shall be impartedOnly to him who hath the power to quell them,Dissolving them to air--my father.DON TOMMASO.         How!You surely will not rouse his fatal wrath?Annicca, listen: if your doubts were true,He whose fierce love guards her with sleepless eyes,More like the passion of some wild, dumb creature,With prowling jealousy and deadly spring,Forth leaping at the first approach of ill,Than the calm tenderness of human fathers;He surely had been keen to scent the danger.I saw him at the ball--as is his wont,He mingled not among the revellers,But like her shadow played the spy on her.ANNICCA.A word would stir less deeply than you dread.DON TOMMASO.Ah, there you err; he knows no middle term.At once he would accept as fact the worstOf your imaginings; his rage would smiteAll near him, and rebound upon himself;For, as I learn, Don John brings royal ordersFor the Queen's gallery; he would dismissThe Prince as roughly as a begging artist.Make no such breach just now betwixt the courtAnd our own kindred.ANNICCA.         Be it so, Tommaso.I will do naught in haste.DON TOMMASO.         Watch thou and wait.A slight reproof might now suffice the child,Tame as a bird unto a gentle voice.ANNICCA.My mind misgives me; yet will I find patience.SCENE III.  Night in RIBERA'S Garden. DON JOHN alone.DON JOHN.In any less than she, so swift a passion,So unreserved, so reckless, had repelled.In her 't is godlike.  Our mutual loveWas born full-grown, as we gazed each on each.Nay, 't was not born, but like a thing eternal,It WAS ere we had consciousness thereof;No growth of slow development, but perfectFrom the beginning, neither doomed to end.Her garden breathes her own warm, southern beauty,Glowing with dewy and voluptuous bloom.Here I am happy--happy to dream and waitIn rich security of bliss.  I knowHow brief an interval divides us now.She hastes to meet me with no less impatienceThan mine to clasp her in my arms, to pressHeart unto heart, and see the love withinThe unfathomable depths of her great eyes.She comes.  Maria!  Enter MARIA, half timid, half joyous.MARIA.         My lord! you have been waiting?DON JOHN.Darling, not long; 't was but my restless loveThat drove me here before the promised hour.So were I well content to wait through agesUpon the threshold of a joy like this,Knowing the gates of heaven might ope to meAt any moment.MARIA.         Your love is less than mine,For I have counted every tedious minuteSince our last meeting.DON JOHN.         I had rather speakLess than the truth to have you chide me thus;Yet if you enter in the lists with me,Faith match with faith, and loyal heart with heart,I warrant you, the jealous god of love,Who spies us from yon pomegranate bush,Would crown me victor.MARIA.         Why should we compete?Who could decide betwixt two equal truths,Two perfect faiths?DON JOHN.         The worship of my lifeWill be slight payment for your boundless trust.Look we nor forth nor back, are we not happy?Heaven smiles above our heads with all her stars.The envious day forced us apart, the wingOf obscure night protects and shelters us.Now like a pure, night-blooming flower, puts forthThe perfect blossom of our love.  Oh, leanThy royal head upon my breast; assure meThat this unheard-of bliss is no fond dream.Cling to me, darling, till thy love's dear burdenTake root about my heart-strings.MARIA (after a pause).         Did you not hearA sound, a cry?  Oh, God! was it my father?DON JOHN.Naught save the beating of our hearts I heard.Be calm, my love; the very air is hushed.Listen, the tinkle of the fountain yonder,The sleepy stir of leaves, the querulous pipeOf some far bird--no more.MARIA.         I heard, I heard!A rude voice called me.  Wherefore did it comeTo snatch me from that dream of restful love?Oh, Juan, you will save me, you will help,--Tell me you will--I have lost all for you!DON JOHN.To-morrow you will laugh at fears like these.You have lost naught--you have but won my love.Lose not your faith in that--your shield and weapon.MARIA.I tremble still in every limb.  Good-night,I must be gone.  To-morrow when you come,Be wary with my father; he is fierceIn love and hatred.  Listen and look, my lord.If one dared say to me but yester-mornThat I would meet at night a stranger youthIn mine own garden, talk with him of love,And hint a thought against the Spagnoletto,I had smitten with this bauble such a one.[Pointing to a jewelled poniard in her belt.]Kiss me, my Juan, once again.  Good-night.[Exit MARIA.]SCENE IV.  The studio.  RIBERA and ANNICCA.ANNICCA.Has he come often?RIBERA.         Nay, I caught the trickOf his fair face in some half-dozen sittings.His is a bold and shapely head--it pleased me.I like the lad; the work upon his portraitWas pastime--'t is already nigh complete.ANNICCA.And has Maria sat here while you worked?RIBERA (sharply).Why not?  What would'st thou say?  Speak, fret me notWith ticklish fears.  Is she not by my side,For work or rest?ANNICCA.         Surely, I meant no harm.Father, how quick you are!  I had but askedIf she, being here, had seen the work progress,And found it his true counterpart.RIBERA.         Annicca,There is something in your thought you hold from me.Have the lewd, prying eyes, the slanderous mindOf public envy, spied herein some mischief?What hast thou heard?  By heaven, if one foul wordHave darkened the fair fame of my white dove,Naples shall rue it.  Let them not forgetThe chapel of Saint Januarius!ANNICCA (aside).Tommaso judged aright. I dare not tell him.Dear father, listen.  Pray, be calm.  Sit down;Your own hot rage engenders in my mindThoughts, fears, suspicions.RIBERA (seating himself).I am foolish, hasty; but it makes me mad.Listen to me.  Here sits the Prince before me;We talk, we laugh.  We have discussed all themes,From the great Angelo's divinity,Down to the pest of flies that fret us hereAt the day's hottest.  Sometimes he will paceThe studio--such young blood is seldom still.He brought me once his mandoline, and drewEloquent music thence.  I study thusThe changeful play of soul.  I catch the spiritBehind the veil, and burn it on the plate.Maria comes and goes--will sit awhileOver her broidery, then will haste awayAnd serve us with a dish of golden fruit.That is for me; she knows the sweet, cool juice,After long hours of work, refreshes meMore than strong wine.  She meets his Royal HighnessAs the Ribera's child should meet a Prince--Nor over bold, nor timid; one would thinkTheir rank was equal, and that neither sprangFrom less than royal lineage.ANNICCA.         Why, I know it.Here is no need to excuse or justify.Speak rather of your work--is the plate finished?RIBERA.So nigh, that were Don John to leave to-morrow,It might go with him.ANNICCA.         What! he leaves Naples?RIBERA.Yea, but I know not when; he seems to waitMomently, orders from his MajestyTo travel onward.ANNICCA (aside).         Would he were well away!RIBERA.What do you mutter?  I grow deaf this side.ANNICCA.I spake not, father.  I regret with youThe Prince should leave us; you have more enjoyedHis young companionship than any strangersThese many years.RIBERA.         Well, well, enough of him.He hath a winning air--so far, so good.I know not that I place more trust in himThan in another.  'T is a lying world;I am too old now to be duped or dazzledBy fair externals.  Enter MARIA, carrying a kirtle full of flowers.MARIA.         Father, see! my rosesHave blossomed over night; I bring you someTo prank your study.  Sister, Don TommasoSeeks you below.ANNICCA (rising).         I will go to meet him.  Father,Until to-morrow.[Embraces MARIA and exits.  MARIA sits by her father's side anddisplays her flowers.]RIBERA.         Truly, a gorgeous show!Pink, yellow, crimson, white--which is the fairest?Those with the deepest blush should best become you--Nay, they accord not with your hair's red gold;The white ones suit you best--pale, innocent,So flowers too can lie!  Is not that strange?[MARIA looks at him in mingled wonder and affright.  He roughlybrushes aside all the flowers upon the floors, than picks one upand carefully plucks it to pieces.]I think not highly of your flowers, girl;I have plucked this leaf; it has no heart.See there![He laughs contemptuously.]MARIA.         What have I done?  Alas! what mean you?Have you then lost your reason?RIBERA.         Nay, but found it.I, who was dull of wit, am keen at last."Don John is comely," and "Don John is kind;""A wonderful musician is Don John,""A princely artist"--and then , meek of mien,You enter in his presence, modest, simple.And who beneath that kitten grace had spiedThe claws of mischief?  Who!  Why, all the world,Save the fond, wrinkled, hoary fool, thy father.Out, girl, for shame!  He will be here anon;Hence to your room--he shall not find you here.Thank God, thank God! no evil hath been wroughtThat may not be repaired.  I have sat byAt all your meetings.  You shall have no more;Myself will look to that.  Away, away![Exit Maria.]RIBERA (looks after her).As one who has received a deadly hurt,She walks.  What if my doubts be false?  The terrorOf an unlooked-for blow, a treacherous thrustWhen least expected--that is all she showed.On a false charge, myself had acted thus.She had been moved far otherwise if guilty;She had wept, protested, begged--she had not leftWith such a proud and speechless show of grief.I was too harsh, too quick on slight suspicion.What did Annicca say?  Why, she said naught.'T was her grave air, her sudden reticence,Her ill-assumed indifference.  They play on me;They know me not.  They dread my violent passions,Not guessing what a firm and constant bridleI hold them with.  On just cause to be angered,Is merely human.  Yet they sound my temper;They try to lead me like some half-tamed beast,That must be coaxed.  Well, I may laugh thereat.But I am not myself to-day; strange painsShoot through my head and limbs and vex my spirit.Oh, I have wronged my child!  Return, Maria![Exit, calling.]ACT IV.SCENE I.  Night. RIBERA'S bedroom.  RIBERA discovered in his dressing-gown,  seated reading beside a table, with a light upon it. Enter from  an open door at the back of the stage, MARIA. She stands  irresolute for a moment on the threshold behind her father,  watching him, passes her hand rapidly over her brow and eyes,  and then knocks.MARIA.May I come in, dear father?RIBERA (putting down his book and looking at her affectionately).         Child, you ask?MARIA (advancing).You study late.  I came to bid good-night.RIBERA.Poor child, thou must be weary.  Thou art paleStill from thy swoon.MARIA (with a forced laugh).         I had forgotten it.Nay, I am well again.RIBERA.         But I forget it not,Neither forgive myself.  Well, it is past,Enough!  When the Prince left I sent for thee;Thou wast still sleeping?MARIA (with confusion).         Yes, I was outworn.What didst thou wish of me?RIBERA.         Merely to tell theeDon John leaves Naples.  He expressed regretMost courteously that thou wast suffering.He had fain ordered us his parting thanksFor our kind welcome--so he deigned to say.To-morrow he may steal a moment's graceTo see us both once more; but this is doubtful,So he entrusted his farewells to me.MARIA.May peace go with him.RIBERA.         We are alone--Are we not, darling?  Thanks for the calm contentWherewith thou biddest him farewell, to nestleOnce more in mine embrace.  Not long, I feel,May these old horny eyes be blest with sightOf thy full-flowering grace, these wrinkled lipsBe pressed against thy brow.  I am no moreWhat I have been; at times both hand and brainRefuse their task.  Myself will follow soon--The better part of me already dead.So the worm claims us by slow torture, child.Thou'lt bear with me, if as to-day I wrongThy gentle spirit?MARIA.         Father, no more, no more!You break my heart.RIBERA.         Mine angel-child, weep notSo bitterly.  I thought not thus to move thee.Still thou art overwrought.  I would have askedAt last a promise of thee.  I am selfish,But I would sleep less startingly o'nights,And bear a calmer soul by day, were I secureThat thou wilt bide with me until the end.[A pause.]To-night I will not press thee.  Thou art weary;Thy nerves have scarce regained their tension yet;But from thy deep emotion I can see'T will cost thee less than I have feared.  To-morrowWe will talk of this again.MARIA.         To-morrow!RIBERA.         Now,Good-night.  'T is time thou shouldst be sleeping.MARIA.         Father,I cannot leave thee!  Every word of thineGnaws like a burning coal my sore, soft heart.What! thou shalt suffer, and thine own MariaWill leave thee daughterless, uncomforted?What! thou shalt weep, and other eyes than mineShall see the Spagnoletto's spirit broken?RIBERA.There, there, poor child!  Look up, cling not so wildlyAbout my neck.  Thou art too finely touched,If thus the faint foreshadow of a griefCan overcome thee.  Listen?  What was that?MARIA (starts up, shudders violently, and, all at once, masters      her emotion).Why, I heard nothing, father.RIBERA.         Yes, a soundOf footsteps, and a stifled call.[He goes toward the casement.  MARIA tries to detain him.]MARIA.         Dear father,Surely 't was naught.  Your ears deceive you.The wind is rising, and you heard the leavesRustling together.RIBERA.         Nay, I will look forth.[He opens the casement and looks out in silence.  MARIA standsbehind him, with her hands clasped in an agony of fear.]RIBERA (calling).Hist, answer!  Who goes there? (a pause.)  No sound.  Thou'rt right,Maria; I see naught; our garden liesVacant and still, save for the swaying branchesOf bush and tree.  'T is a wild, threatening night.A sultry breeze is blowing, and the skyHangs black above Vesuvius.  Yonder cloudHath lightnings in it.  Ah, a blinding boltDims the volcano's pillared fire.  Enough.[He closes the casement and returns to MARIA.]Hark, how the thunder rolls!  My child, you trembleLike the blown leaves without.MARIA.         I am oppressedBy the same stormy influence.  Thou knowestI dread the thunder.RIBERA.         Thou, who art safely housed,Why shouldst thou dread it?  Try to sleep, my darling;Forget the terror of the tempest; mornWill break again in sunshine.MARIA.         Father, sayYou love me and you trust me once again,Before I bid good-night.RIBERA.         If it will calm thee,I love thee and I trust thee.  Thou art to meMy genius--thou, the breathing image stillOf thy saint-mother, whom the angels guard.Even as thou standest now, vested in white,With glowing eyes and pale, unsmiling face,I see her as she stood the day her heartWent forth from home and kin to bless the strangerWho craved her father's alms.MARIA.         Thanks, thanks.  Good-night.God bless us through these wild, dark hours.RIBERA.         Good-night.SCENE II.  RIBERA'S garden.  Half the sky illuminated by an over-clouded  moon, the rest obscured by an approaching storm.  Occasional  thunder and lightning.  On on side of the stage a summer-house  open to the audience, on the other side the exterior of the  dwelling.  DON JOHN discovered waiting near the house.  The door  opens, and enter MARIA.DON JOHN (springing forward and embracing her).At last! at last!MARIA.         Juan, beware!  My father's fears,I cannot guess by whom or what, are roused.[She extends her arms gropingly to embrace him.]Oh, let me feel thee near me--I see naught.Follow me; here our voices may be heard.[She hastens towards the summer-house, leaning upon his arm,and sinks upon a seat.]Have not slow ages passed with crowding woesSince we last met!  What have I not endured!Oh, Juan, save me!DON JOHN.         Dearest child, be calm.Thou art strangely overwrought.  Speak not.  AwaitTill this wild fear be past.MARIA.         How great you are!Your simple presence stills and comforts me.While you are here, the one thing real to meIn all the universe is love.DON JOHN.         And yetMy love is here, if I be far or nigh.Is this the spirit of a soldier's wife?Nay, fiery courage, iron fortitude,That soul must own that dares to say, "I love."MARIA.And I dare say it.  I can bear the worstThat envious fate may heap upon my head,If thou art with me, or for hope of thee.DON JOHN.Art sure of that?  Thou couldst not part from me,Even for thy father's sake?MARIA.         Talk you of parting?For God's sake, what is this?  You love no more?DON JOHN.Rather I love so truly that I shrinkFrom asking thee to share a soldier's fate.I tremble to uproot so fine a flowerFrom its dear native earth.  I--MARIA (putting her hand on his lips).         Hush, no more!I need no preparation more than this,Your mere request.DON JOHN.         There spake my heroine.The King, my father, bids me to repairUnto Palermo.MARIA.         Shall we sail to-night?DON JOHN.My Princess!  Thou recoilest not from allThou must endure, ere I can openlyClaim thee my wife!MARIA.         The pangs of purgatoryWere lightly borne with such a heaven in view.I were content with one brief hour a day,Snatched from the toils of war and thy high duties,To gaze on thy dear face--to feel thy hand,Even as now a stay and a caress.DON JOHN.Angel, I have no thanks.  May God forget meWhen I forget this hour!  So, thou art firm--Ready this night to leave thy home, thy kin,Thy father?MARIA (solemnly).         I am ready and resolved.Yet judge me not so lightly as to deemI say this with no pang.  My love were naught,Could I withdraw it painlessly at onceFrom him round whose colossal strength the tendrilsOf mine own baby heart were taught to twine.I speak not now as one who swerves or shrinks,But merely, dear, to show thee what sharp torturesI, nowise blind, but with deliberate soul,Embrace for thee.DON JOHN.         How can I doubt the anguishSo rude a snapping of all ties must smiteThy tender heart withal?  Yet, dwell we notOn the brief pain, but on the enduring joys.If Ribera's love be all thou deemest,He will forgive thy secret flight, thy--MARIA.         Secret!May I not bid farewell?  May I not tell himWhere we are bound?  How soon he may have hopeTo hear from me--to welcome me, thy Princess?I dare not leave him without hope.DON JOHN.         My child,Thou art mad!  We must be secret as the grave,Else are we both undone.  I have given outThat I depart in princely state to-morrow.Far from the quay a bark awaiteth us.I know my man.  Shrouded by careful night,We will set secret sail for Sicily.Once in Palermo, thou mayst write thy father--Sue for his pardon--tell him that, ere long,When I have won by cautious policyKing Philip's favor, thou shalt be proclaimedPrincess of Austria.MARIA (who has hung upon his words with trembling excitement,      covers her face with her hands, and bursts into tears).         I cannot! no! I cannot!DON JOHN (scornfully).I feared as much.  Well, it is better thus.I asked thee not to front the "worst of illsThat envious fate could heap upon thy head"--Only a little patience.  'T was too much;I cannot blame thee.  'T is a loving father.I, a mere stranger, had naught else to hope,Matching my claim with his.MARIA (looks at him and throws herself at his feet).         Oh, pardon, pardon!My Lord, my Prince, my husband!  I am thine!Lead wheresoe'er thou wilt, I follow thee.Tell me a life's devotion may effaceThe weakness of a moment!DON JOHN (raising her tenderly and embracing her).Ah, mine own!SCENE III.  Morning.  The studio.  Enter RIBERA.RIBERA.How laughingly the clear sun shines to-dayOn storm-drenched green, and cool, far-glittering seas!When she comes in to greet me, she will blushFor last night's terrors.  How she crouched and shudderedAt the mere thought of the wild war without!Poor, clinging women's souls, what need is theirsOf our protecting love!  Yet even on meThe shadow of the storm-cloud seemed to breed.Through my vexed sleep I heard the thunder roll;My dreams were ugly--  Well, all that is past;To-day my spirit is renewed.  'T is longSince I have felt so fresh.[He seats himself before his easel and takes up his brush andpalette, but holds them idly in his hand.]         Strange, she still sleeps!The hour is past when she is wont to comeTo bless me with the kiss of virgin love.Mayhap 't was fever in her eyes last nightGave them so wild a glance, so bright a lustre.God! if she should be ill![He rises and calls.]Luca!Enter LUCA.LUCA.         My lord?RIBERA.Go ask Fiametta if the mistress sleeps--If she be ailing--why she has not comeThis morn to greet me.[Exit LUCA.]RIBERA (begins pacing the stage).        What fond fears are theseMastering my spirit?  Since her mother diedI tremble at the name of pain or ill.How can my rude love tend, my hard hand soothe,The dear child's fragile--[A confused cry without.]         What is that?  My God!How hast thou stricken me![He staggers and falls into a chair.  Enter hastily FIAMETTA,weeping, and LUCA with gestures of terror and distress.]FIAMETTA.         Master!LUCA.         Dear master![RIBERA rises with a great effort and confronts them.]RIBERA.What is it?  Speak!LUCA.         Dear master, she is gone.RIBERA.How?  Murdered--dead?  Oh, cruel God!  Away!Follow me not![Exit RIBERA.]FIAMETTA.         Help, all ye saints of heaven.Have pity on him!  Oh, what a day is this!LUCA.Quiet, Fiametta.  When the master findsThe empty, untouched bed, the silent room,His wits will leave him.  Hark! was that his cry?  Reenter RIBERA calling.Maria! Daughter! Where have they taken thee,My only one, my darling?  Oh, the brigands!Naples shall bleed for this.  What do ye here,Slaves, fools, who stare upon me?  Know ye notI have been robbed?  Hence!  Ransack every houseFrom cave to roof in Naples.  Search all streets.Arrest whomso ye meet.  Let no sail stirFrom out the harbor.  Ring the alarum!  Quick!This is a general woe.[Exeunt LUCA and FIAMETTA.]         The Duke's my friend;He'll further me.  The Prince--oh, hideous fear!--No, no, I will not dream it.  Mine enemiesHave done this thing; the avengers of that beggar--Domenichino--they have struck home at last.How was it that I heard no sound, no cry,Throughout the night?  The heavens themselves conspiredAgainst me--the hoarse thunder drowned her shrieks!Oh, agony![He buries his face in his hands.  Enter ANNICCA; she throwsherself speechless and weeping upon his neck.]         Thou knowest it, Annicca!The thief has entered in the night--she's gone.I stand and weep; I stir not hand or foot.Is not the household roused?  Do they not seek her?I am helpless, weak; an old man overnight.The brigands' work was easy.  I heard naught.But surely, surely, had they murdered her,I had heard that--that would have wakened meFrom out my grave.ANNICCA.         Father, she is not dead.RIBERA (wildly).Where have they found her?  What dost thou know?  Speak, speak,Ere my heart break!ANNICCA.         Alas! they have not found her;But that were easy.  Nerve thyself--rememberThou art the Spagnoletto still.  Last nightDon John fled secretly from Naples.RIBERA.         Ah!Give me a draft of water.[He sinks down on his chair.]ANNICCA (calling).         Help, Tommaso!Luca! Fiametta! Father, lookup, look up!Gaze not so hollowly.  Enter DON TOMMASO and SERVANTS.         Quick! water, water!Do ye not see he swoons?[She kneels before her father, chafing and kissing his hands. ExitLUCA, who returns immediately with a silver flagon of water. ANNICCAseizes it and raises it to RIVERA'S lips.  He takes it from her handand drinks.]RIBERA.         How your hand trembles!See, mine is firm.  You had spilt it o'er my beardHad I not saved it.  Thanks.  I am strong again.I am very old for such a steady grasp.Why, girl, most men as hoary as thy fatherAre long since palsied.  But my firm touch comesFrom handling of the brush.  I am a painter,The Spagnoletto--[As he speaks his name he suddenly throws off his apathy, risesto his full height, and casts the flagon to the ground.]         Ah, the Spagnoletto,Disgraced, abandoned!  My exalted nameThe laughing-stock of churls; my hearthstone stampedWith everlasting shame; my pride, my fame,Mine honor--where are they?  With yon spilt water,Fouled in the dust, sucked by the thirsty air.Now, by Christ's blood, my vengeance shall be hugeAs mine affront.  I will demand full justiceFrom Philip.  We will treat as King with King.HE shall be stripped of rank and name and wealth,Degraded, lopped from off the fellowshipOf Christians like a rotten limb, proclaimedThe bastard that he is.  She shall go with him,Linked in a common infamy, haled round,A female Judas, who betrayed her father,Her God, her conscience, with a kiss.  Her shadowShall be my curse.  Cursed be her sleep by night,Accursed her light by day--her meat and drink!Accursed the fruit of her own womb--the graveWhere she will lie!  Cursed-- Oh, my child, my child![He throws himself on the floor and buries his head among thecushions of the couch.  DON TOMMASO advances and lays his hand on RIBERA'S shoulder.]DON TOMMASO.Mine honored sir--RIBERA (looks up without rising).         Surely you mock me, signor.Honored!  Yes, honored with a rifled home,A desecrated heart, a strumpet child.For honors such as these, I have not stintedSweat, blood, or spirit through long years of toil.I have passed through peril scathless; I was sparedWhen Naples was plague-stricken; I have 'scapedMine enemies' stiletto--fire and flood;I have survived my love, my youth, my self,My thrice-blest Leonora, whom I pitied,Fool that I was! in her void, silent tomb.The God of mercy hath reserved me trulyFor a wise purpose.ANNICCA.         Father, rise; take courage;We know not yet the end.RIBERA.         Why should I riseTo front the level eyes of men's contempt?Oh, I am shamed!  Cover my head, Annicca;Darken mine eyes, and veil my face.  Oh, God,Would that I were a nameless, obscure man,So could I bury with me my disgrace,That now must be immortal.  Where thou standest,Annicca, there she stood last night.  She kissed me;Round mine old neck she wreathed her soft, young arms.My wrinkled cheeks were wet with her warm tears.She shuddered, and I thought it was the thunderStruck terror through her soul.  White-bearded fool!FIAMETTA.I found this scrip upon the chamber-floor,Mayhap it brings some comfort.RIBERA (starts up and snatches the paper she offers him, reads       it rapidly, then to ANNICCA wildly).         Look, look there--'T is writ in blood: "My duty to my lordForbids my telling you our present port."I would track her down with sleuth-hounds, did I notAbhor to see her face.  Ah, press thy handsAgainst my head--my brain is like to burst--My throat is choked.  Help! help![He swoons.]SCENE IV.  A street.  Enter LORENZO and a GENTLEMAN, meeting.  They salute,  and LORENZO is about to pass on.LORENZO.Good-morning, sir.GENTLEMAN.         Hail and farewell so soon,Friend dreamer?  I will lay a goodly sumThe news that flies like fire from tongue to tongueHath not yet warmed thine ear.LORENZO.         What's that?  I layA sum as fair thy news is some dry taleOf courtly gossip, touching me as nighAs the dissensions of the antipodes.GENTLEMAN.Done for a hundred florins!  In the night,'Midst the wild storm whose roar must have invadedEven thy leaden sleep, Prince John left Naples.We should have had a pageant here to-day,A royal exit, floral arches thrownFrom house to house in all the streets he passed,Music and guard of honor, homage fittingThe son of Philip--but the bird has flown.LORENZO.So!  I regret our busy citizens,Who sun themselves day-long upon the quays,Should be deprived of such a festival.Your wager's lost--how am I moved by this?GENTLEMAN.Hark to the end.  'T would move all men whose veinsFlow not clear water.  He hath carried offThe Rose of Naples.LORENZO.         What wouldst thou say?  Speak out!In God's name, who hath followed him?GENTLEMAN.         Ah, thou'rt roused.Thy master hath been robbed--the Spagnoletto--Maria of the Golden Locks--his daughter.LORENZO.How is this known?  'T is a foul slander forgedBy desperate malice.  What! in the night, you say?--She whose bright name was clean as gold, whose heartShone a fixed star of loyal love and dutyBeside her father's glory!  This coarse lieDenies itself.  I will go seek the master,And if this very noon she walk not forth,Led by the Spagnoletto, through the streets,To blind the dazed eyes of her slanderers,--I am your debtor for a hundred florins.GENTLEMAN.Your faith in womanhood becomes you, sir.(Aside.) A beggar's child the mistress of a Prince;Humph! there be some might think the weight of scandalLay on the other side.  (To Lorenzo.) You need not forthTo seek her father.  See, he comes, alone.I will not meddle in the broil.  Farewell![Exit Gentleman.]  Enter RIBERA, without hat or mantle, slowly, with folded arms  and bent head.LORENZO.Oh heart, break not for pity!  Shall he thusUnto all Naples blazon his disgrace?This must not be (advancing).  Father!RIBERA (starts and looks up sharply).         Who calls me father?LORENZO.Why, master, I--you know me not?  Lorenzo.RIBERA.Nor do I care to know thee.  Thou must beAn arrant coward, thus to league with foesAgainst so poor a wretch as I--to call meBy the most curst, despised, unhallowed nameGod's creatures can own.  Away! and let me pass;I injure no man.LORENZO.         Look at me, dear master.Your head is bare, your face is ashy pale,The sun is fierce.  I am your friend, your pupil;Let me but guide my reverend master home,In token of the grateful memoryWherein I hold his guidance of my mindUp the steep paths of art.[While LORENZO speaks, RIBERA slowly gains consciousness of hissituation, raises his hand to his head and shudders violently.LORENZO'S last words seem to awaken him thoroughly.]RIBERA.         I crave your pardonIf I have answered roughly, Sir Lorenzo.My thoughts were far away--I failed to know you--I have had trouble, sir.  You do remind me,I had forgot my hat; that is a trifle,Yet now I feel the loss.  What slaves are weTo circumstance!  One who is wont to coverFor fashion or for warmth his pate, goes forthBareheaded, and the sun will seem to smiteThe shrinking spot, the breeze will make him shiver,And yet our hatless beggars heed them not.We are the fools of habit.  Enter two gentlemen together as promenading; they cross the stage,  looking hard at RIBERA and LORENZO, and exeunt.LORENZO.         Pray you, sirLet me conduct you home.  Here is no placeTo hold discourse.  In God's name, come with me.RIBERA.What coupled staring fools were they that passed?They seemed to scare thee.  Why, boy, face them out.I am the shadow of the Spagnoletto,Else had I brooked no gaze so insolent.Well, I will go with thee.  But, hark thee, lad;A word first in thine ear.  'T is a grim secret;Whisper it not in Naples; I but tell thee,Lest thou should fancy I had lost my wits.My daughter hath deserted me--hath fledFrom Naples with a bastard.  Thou hast seen her,Maria-Rosa--thou must remember her;She, whom I painted as Madonna once.She had fair hair and Spanish eyes.  When was it?I came forth thinking I might meet with herAnd find all this a dream--a foolish thought!I am very weary.  (Yawning.)  I have walked and walkedFor hours.  How far, sir, stand we from the StradaNardo?  I live there, nigh Saint Francis' church.LORENZO.Why, 't is hard by; a stone's throw from this square.So, lean on me--you are not well.  This way.Pluck up good heart, sir; we shall soon be there.[Exeunt.]SCENE V.  Night.  A Room in RIBERA'S House.  ANNICCA seated alone, in an  attitude of extreme weariness and despondency.ANNICCA.His heavy sleep still lasts.  Despite the wordsOf the physician, I can cast not offThat ghastly fear.  Albeit he owned no drugs,This deathlike slumber, this deep breathing slow,His livid pallor makes me dread each momentHis weary pulse will cease.  This is the end,And from the first I knew it.  The worst evilMy warning tongue had wrought were joy to this.No heavier curse could I invoke on herThan that she see him in her dreams, her thoughts,As he is now.  I could no longer bear it;I have fled hither from his couch to breathe--To quicken my spent courage for the end.I cannot pray--my heart is full of curses.He sleeps; he rests.  What better could I wishFor his rent heart, his stunned, unbalanced brain,Than sleep to be eternally prolonged?  Enter FIAMETTA.  ANNICCA looks up anxiously, half rising.ANNICCA.How now?  What news?FIAMETTA.         The master is awakeAnd calls for you, signora.ANNICCA.Heaven be praised![Exit hastily.]FIAMETTA.Would I had followed my young mistress!  HereI creep about like a scared, guilty thing,And fancy at each moment they will guess'T was I who led her to the hut.  I will confess,If any sin there be, to Father Clement,And buy indulgence with her golden chain.'T would burn my throat, the master's rolling eyesWould haunt me ever, if I went to wear it.So, all will yet be well.[Exit.]SCENE VI.  RIBERA'S Room.  RIBERA discovered sitting on the couch. He looks  old and haggard, but has regained his natural bearing and  expression.  Enter ANNICCA.  She hastens towards him, and kneels  beside the couch, kissing him affectionately.ANNICCA.Father, you called me?RIBERA.         Aye, to bid good-night.Why do you kiss me?  To betray to-morrow?ANNICCA.Dear father, you are better; you have slept.Are you not rested?RIBERA.         Child, I was not weary.There was some cloud pressed here (pointing to his forehead) but   that is past,I have no pain nor any sense of ill.Now, while my brain is clear, I have a wordTo speak.  I think not I have been to thee,Nor to that other one, an unkind father.I do not now remember any act,Or any word of mine, could cause thee grief.But I am old--perchance my memoryDeceives in this?  Speak!  Am I right, Annicca?ANNICCA (weeping).Oh, father, father, why will you torture me?You were too good, too good.RIBERA.         Why, so I thought.Since it appears the guerdon of such goodnessIs treachery, abandonment, disgrace,I here renounce my fatherhood.  No childWill I acknowledge mine.  Thou art a wife;Thy duty is thy husband's.  When AntonioReturns from Seville, tell him that his fatherIs long since dead.  Henceforward I will ownNo kin, no home, no tie.  I will away,To-morrow morn, and live an anchorite.One thing ye cannot rob me of--my work.My name shall still outsoar these low, mirk vapors--Not the Ribera, stained with sin and shame,As she hath left it, but the Spagnoletto.My glory is mine own.  I have done with it,But I bequeath it to my country.  NowI will make friends with beasts--they'll prove less savageThan she that was my daughter.  I have spokenFor the last time that word.  Thee I curse not;Thou hast not set thy heel upon my heart;But yet I will not bless thee.  Go.  Good-night.ANNICCA (embracing him).What! will you spurn me thus?  Nay, I will bide,And be to thee all that she should have been,Soothe thy declining years, and heal the woundOf this sharp sorrow.  Thou shalt bless me still,Father--[RIBERA has yielded for a moment to her embrace; but, suddenlyrising, he pushes her roughly from him.]RIBERA.Away!  I know thee.  Thou art oneWith her who duped me with like words last night.Then I believed; but now my sense is closed,My heart is dead as stone.  I cast thee forth.By heaven, I own thee not!  Thou dost forgetI am the Spagnoletto.  Away, I say,Or ere I strike thee.[He threatens her.]ANNICCA.        Woe is me!  Help, help![Exit.]RIBERA.So, the last link is snapt.  Had I not steeledMy heart, I fain had kissed her farewell.'T is better so.  I leave my work unfinished.Could I arise each day to face this spectre,Or sleep with it at night?--to yearn for herEven while I curse her?  No!  The dead remainSacred and sweet in our remembrance still;They seem not to have left us; they abideAnd linger nigh us in the viewless air.The fallen, the guilty, must be rooted outFrom heart and thought and memory.  With themNo hope of blest reunion; they must beAs though they had not been; their spoken nameCuts like a knife.  When I essay to thinkOf what hath passed to-day, my sick brain reels.The letter I remember, but all sinceFloats in a mist of horror, and I graspNo actual form.  Did I not wander forth?A mob surrounded me.  All Naples knewMy downfall, and the street was paved with eyesThat stared into my soul.  Then friendly handsGuided me hither.  When I woke, I feltAs though a stone had rolled from off my brain.But still this nightmare bides the truth.  I knowThey watch me, they suspect me.  I will waitTill the whole household sleep, and then steal forth,Nor unavenged return.ACT V.SCENE I.  A Room in DON TOMMASO'S House.  ANNICCA discovered, attired in  mourning.  Enter DON TOMMASO.DON TOMMASO.If he still live, now shall we hear of him.The news I learn will lure him from his covert,Where'er it lie, to pardon or avenge.ANNICCA (eagerly).What news?  What cheer, Tommaso?DON TOMMASO.         Meagre cheer,But tidings that break through our slow suspense,Like the first thunder-clap in sultry air.Don John sets sail from Sicily, to wedA Princess chosen by the King.  Maria--ANNICCA.Talk not of her--I know her not; her nameWill sear thy tongue.  Think'st thou, in truth this newsWill draw my father from his hiding-place?No--teach me not to hope.  Within my heartA sure voice tells me he is dead.  Not hisThe spirit to drag out a shameful life,To shrink from honest eyes, to sink his browUnto the dust, here where he wore his crown.Thou knowest him.  Have I not cause to mournUncomforted, that he, the first of fathers,Self-murdered--nay, child-murdered--Oh, Tommaso,I would fare barefoot to the ends of the earthTo look again upon his living face,See in his eyes the light of love restored--Not blasting me with lightnings as before--To kneel to him, to solace him, to winFor mine own head, yoked in my sister's curseThe blessing he refused me.DON TOMMASO.         Well, take comfort;This grace may yet be thine.SCENE II.  Palermo.  A Nunnery.  Enter ABBESS, followed by a Lay-Sister.ABBESS.Is the poor creature roused?LAY-SISTER.         Nay, she still sleeps.'T would break your pious heart to see her, mother.She begged our meanest cell, though 't is past doubtShe has been bred to delicate luxury.I deemed her spent, had not the soft breast heavedAs gently as a babe's and even in dreamsTwo crystal drops oozed from her swollen lids,And trickled down her cheeks.  Her grief sleeps not,Although the fragile body craves its rest.ABBESS.Poor child!  I fear she hath sore need of prayer.Hath she yet spoken?LAY-SISTER.         Only such scant wordsOf thanks or answer as our proffered serviceOr questionings demand.  When we are silent,Even if she wake, she seemeth unawareOf any presence.  She will sit and wail,Rocking upon the ground, with dull, wide eyes,Wherefrom the streaming tears unceasing course;The only sound that then escapes her lipsIs, "Father, Father!" in such piteous strainAs though her rent heart bled to utter it.ABBESS.Still she abides then by her first requestTo take the black veil and its vows to-morrow?LAY-SISTER.Yea, to that purpose desperately she clings.This evening, if she rouse, she makes confession.Even now a holy friar waits without,Fra Bruno, of the order of Carthusians,Beyond Palermo.ABBESS.         I will speak with him,Ere he confess her, since we know him not.Follow me, child, and see if she have waked.[Exeunt.]SCENE III.  A Cell in the Nunnery.  MARIA discovered asleep on a straw  pallet.  She starts suddenly from her sleep with a little cry,  half rises and remains seated on her pallet.MARIA.Oh, that wild dream!  My weary bones still acheWith the fierce pain; they wrenched me limb from limb.Thou hadst full cause, my father.  But thou, Juan,What was my sin to thee, save too much love?Oh, would to God my back were crooked with age,My smooth cheek seamed with wrinkles, my bright hairHoary with years, and my quick blood impededBy sluggish torpor, so were I near the endOf woes that seem eternal!  I am strong--Death will not rescue me.  Within my veinsI feel the vigorous pulses of young life,Refusing my release.  My heart at timesRebels against the habit of despair,And, ere I am aware, has wandered back,Among forbidden paths.  What prayer, what penance,Will shrive me clean before the sight of heaven?My hands are black with parricide.  Why elseShould his dead face arise three nights before me,Bleached, ghastly, dripping as of one that's drowned,To freeze my heart with horror?  Christ, have mercy![She covers her face with her hands in an agony of despair.]  Enter a MONK.THE MONK.May peace be in this place![MARIA shudders violently at the sound of his voice; looks up andsees the MONK with bent head, and hands partially extended, as onewho invokes a blessing.  She rises, falls at his feet, and takes thehem of his skirt between her hands, pressing it to he lips.]MARIA.          Welcome, thrice welcome!Bid me not rise, nor bless me with pure hands.Ask not to see my face.  Here let me lie,Kissing the dust--a cast-away, a trait'ress,A murderess, a parricide!MONK.         AccursedWith all Hell's curses is the crime thou nam'st!What devil moved thee?  Who and whence art thou,That wear'st the form of woman, though thou lack'stThe heart of the she-wolf?  Who was thy parent,What fiend of torture, that thine impious handsShould quench the living source of thine own life?MARIA.Spare me! oh, spare me!  Nay, my hands are clean.He was the first, best, noblest among men.I was his light, his soul, his breath of life.These I withdrew from him, and made his daysA darkness.  Yet, perchance he is not dead,And blood and tears may wash away my guilt.Oh, tell me there is hope, though it gleam far--One solitary ray, one steadfast spark,Beyond a million years of purgatory!My burning soul thirsts for the dewy balmOf comfortable grace.  One word, one word,Or ere I perish of despair!MONK.         What word?The one wherewith thou bad'st thy father hope?What though he be not dead?  Is breathing life?Hast thou not murdered him in spirit? dealtThe death-blow to his heart?  Cheat not thy soulWith empty dreams--thy God hath judged ye guilty!MARIA.Have pity, father!  Let me tell thee all.Thou, cloistered, holy and austere, know'st notMy glittering temptations.  My betrayerWas of an angel's aspect.  His were all gifts,All grace, all seeming virtue.  I was plunged,Deaf, dumb, and blind, and hand-bound in the deep.If a poor drowning creature craved thine aid,Thou wouldst not spurn it.  Such a one am I,And all the waves roll over me.  Wrest me from my doom!Say not that I am lost!MONK.         I can but sayWhat the just Spirit prompts.  Myself am naughtTo pardon or condemn.  The sin is sinned;The fruit forbid is tasted, yea, and pressedOf its last honeyed juices. Wilt thou nowEscape the after-bitterness with prayers,Scourgings, and wringings of the hands?  Shall theseUndo what has been done?--make whole the heartThy crime hath snapt in twain?--restore the witsThy sin hath scattered?  No!  Thy punishmentIs huge as thine offence.  Death shall not help,Neither shall pious life wash out the stain.Living thou'rt doomed, and dead, thou shalt be lost,Beyond salvation.MARIA (springing to her feet).         Impious priest, thou liest!God will have mercy--as my father would,Could he but see me in mine agony![The MONK throws back his cowl and discovers himself as theSPAGNOLETTO.  MARIA utters a piercing cry and throws herselfspeechless at his feet.]RIBERA.Thou know'st me not.  I am not what I was.My outward shape remains unchanged; these eyes,Now gloating on thine anguish, are the sameThat wept to see a shadow cross thy brow;These ears, that drink the music of thy groans,Shrank from thy lightest sigh of melancholy.Thou think'st to find the father in me still?Thy parricidal hands have murdered him--Thou shalt not find a man.  I am the spiritOf blind revenge--a brute, unswerving force.What deemest thou hath bound me unto life?Ambition, pleasure, or the sense of fear?What, but the sure hope of this fierce, glad hour,That I might track thee down to this--might seeThy tortured body writhe beneath my feet,And blast thy stricken spirit with my curse?MARIA (in a crushed voice).Have mercy! mercy!RIBERA.         Yes, I will have mercy--The mercy of the tiger or the wolf,Athirst for blood.MARIA (terror-struck, rises upon her knees in an attitude of      supplication.  RIBERA averts his face).         Oh, father, kill me not!Turn not away--I am not changed for thee!In God's name, look at me--thy child, thine own!Spare me, oh, spare me, till I win of HeavenSome sign of promise!  I am lost foreverIf I die now.RIBERA (looks at her in silence, then pushing her from him laughs       bitterly).         Nay, have no fear of me.I would not do thee that much grace to ease theeOf the gross burden of the flesh.  Behold,Thou shalt be cursed with weary length of days;And when thou seek'st to purge thy guilty heart,Thou shalt find there a sin no prayer may shrive--The murder of thy father.  To all dreamsThat haunt thee of past anguish, shall be addedThe vision of this horror![He draws from his girdle a dagger and stabs himself to the heart;he falls and dies, and MARIA flings herself, swooning upon his body.][Portions of this header are copyright (C) 2001 by Michael Hart]This etext was produced by anonymous Project Gutenberg VolunteersThe Project Gutenberg Etext of The Complete Works of Artemus Ward(Charles Farrar Browne) Part 1THE COMPLETE WORKS OF ARTEMUS WARD(CHARLES FARRAR BROWNE)WITH:PRELIMINARY NOTES BY JOHN CAMDEN HOTTEN.A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH BY MELVILLE D.

It is issuedbecause of a demand for a BETTER EDITION than has ever beenpublished.In order to supply this acknowledged want, the publishers haveenlarged and perfected this edition by adding some matter notheretofore published in book form.More than one hundred thousand copies of the work have beenprinted.  The plates had become so worn as to render itunreadable, yet the sale kept on.  In preparing this new edition,many of the author's fragmentary pieces, not contained in the oldedition, have been added.  The earliest of the author's writings,published in periodicals in 1862, are included, together withmany additional illustrations, which now, for the first time,make the work complete.It is universally conceded that no country in the world has everproduced a genius like Artemus Ward.  Writers of ACKNOWLEDGEDGENIUS are never very numerous.  He attained a great and deservedpopularity, which will be lasting.It has been observed that the wit of one generation is rarelyappreciated by the next, but this is not true of Artemus Ward.There is a constant demand for his writings, for the reason thathis jokes require no appendix for their elucidation.  No one whospeaks the English language can fail to appreciate his wonderfulhumor.  It will always be funny.  There is a fascination about itwhich can neither be questioned nor resisted.  His particularniche in the temple of Fame will not be claimed by another.  Hisintellect was sharp and electric.  He saw the humor of anythingat a glance, and his manner of relating these laughter-provokingabsurdities is original and "fetching."PRELIMINARY NOTES BY JOHN CAMDEN HOTTEN.Piccadilly, W.  Jan. 30, 1865.There is a story of two "smart" Yankees, one named Hosea and theother Hezekiah, who met in an oyster shop in Boston.  Said Hosea,"As to opening oysters, why nothing's easier if you only knowhow."  "And how's how?" asked Hezekiah.  "Scotch snuff," repliedHosea, very gravely--"Scotch snuff.  Bring a little of it ever sonear their noses, and they'll sneeze their lids off."  "I know aman who knows a better plan," observed Hezekiah.  "He spreads thebivalves in a circle, seats himself in the centre, reads achapter of Artemus Ward to them, and goes on until they getinterested.  One by one they gape with astonishment at A. Ward'swhoppers, and as they gape my friend whips 'em out, peppers away,and swallows 'em."Excellent as all that Artemus Ward writes really is, andexuberantly overflowing with humour as are nearly all hisarticles, it is too bad to accuse him of telling "whoppers."  Onthe contrary, the old Horatian question of "Who shall forbid meto speak truth in laughter?" seems ever present to his mind.  Hislatest production is the admirable paper "Artemus Ward among theFenians" which appears in Part 7.If Artemus has on any occasion really told "whoppers," it hasbeen in his announcements of being about to visit England.  Fromtime to time he has stated his intention of visiting thiscountry, and from time to time has he disappointed his Englishfriends.He was coming to England after his trip to California, when,laden with gold, he could think of no better place to spend itin.He was on his way to England when he and his companion, Mr.Hingston, encountered the Pi-ute Indians, and narrowly escapedscalping.He was leaving for England with "Betsy Jane" and the "snaiks"before the American war was ended.He had unscrewed the head of each of his "wax figgers," and senteach on board in a carpet-bag, labelled "For England," just as MrLincoln was assassinated.He was hastening to England when the news came a few weeks agothat he had been blown up in an oil well!He has been on his way to England in every newspaper of theAmerican Union for the last two years.Here is the latest announcement:"Artemus Ward, in a private letter, states that Doctor Kumming,the famous London seer and profit, having foretold that the endof the world will happen on his own birthday in January 1867, he,Artemus, will not visit England until the latter end of 1866,when the people there will be selling off, and dollars will beplentiful.  Mr. Ward says that he shall leave England in the laststeamer, in time to see the American eagle spread his wings, andwith the stars and stripes in his beek and tallents, sore away tohis knativ empyrehum.--"  American Paper.But even this is likely to be a "whopper," for a more reliableprivate letter from Artemus declares his fixed purpose to leavefor England in the steamship City of Boston early in June; andthe probabilities are that he will be stepping on English shoresjust about the time that these pages go to press.Lest anything should happen to him, and England be for everdeprived of seeing him, the most recent production of his pen,together with two or three of his best things, are here embalmedfor preservation, on the principle adopted by the affectionatewidow of the bear-trainer of Perpignan.  "I have nothing left,"said the woman; "I am absolutely without a roof to shelter me andthe poor animal."  "Animal!" exclaimed the prefect; "you don'tmean to say that you keep the bear that devoured your husband?""Alas!" she replied, "it is all that is left to me of the poordear man!"If any other excuse be needed for thus presenting the Britishpublic with A. Ward's "last," in addition to the pertinency ofthe article and its real merit, that excuse may be found in thefact that it is thoroughly new to readers on this side of theAtlantic.The general public will undoubtedly receive "Artemus Ward amongthe Fenians" with approving laughter.  Should it fall into thehands of a philo-Fenian the effect may be different.  To him itwould probably have the wrong action of the Yankee bone-pickingmachine."I've got a new machine," said a Yankee pedlar, "for pickingbones out of fish.  Now, I tell you, it's a leetle bit thedarndest thing you ever did see.  All you have to do is to set iton a table and turn a crank, and the fish flies right down yourthroat and the bones right under the grate.  Well, there was acountry greenhorn got hold of it the other day, and he turned thecrank the wrong way; and, I tell you, the way the bones flew downhis throat was awful.  Why, it stuck that fellow so full ofbones, that he could not get his shirt off for a whole week!"In addition to the paper on the Fenians, two other articles byArtemus Ward are reprinted in the present work.  One relates tothe city of Washington, and the other to the author's imaginarytown of Baldinsville.  Both are highly characteristic of thewriter and of his quaint spellings--a heterography not more oddthan that of the postmaster of Shawnee County, Missouri, who,returning his account to the General Office, wrote, "I hearbysertify that the four going A-Counte is as nere Rite as I now howto make It, if there is any mistake it is not Dun a purpers."Artemus Ward has created a new model for funny writers; and thefact is noticeable that, in various parts of this country as wellas in his own, he has numerous puny imitators, who suppose thatby simply adopting his comic spelling they can write quite aswell as he can.  Perhaps it would be as well if they rememberedthe joke of poor Thomas Hood, who said that he could write aswell as Shakespere if he had the mind to, but the trouble was--hehad not got the mind.*   *   *A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH BY MELVILLE D. LANDON.Charles Farrar Browne, better known to the world as "ArtemusWard," was born at Waterford, Oxford County, Maine, on thetwenty-sixth of April, 1834, and died of consumption atSouthampton, England, on Wednesday, the sixth of March, 1867.His father, Levi Browne, was a land surveyor, and Justice of thePeace.  His mother, Caroline E. Brown, is still living, and is adescendant from Puritan stock.Mr. Browne's business manager, Mr. Hingston, once asked him abouthis Puritanic origin, when he replied:  "I think we came fromJerusalem, for my father's name was Levi and we had a Moses and aNathan in the family, but my poor brother's name was Cyrus; so,perhaps, that makes us Persians."Charles was partially educated at the Waterford school, whenfamily circumstances induced his parents to apprentice him tolearn the rudiments of printing in the office of the "SkowheganClarion," published some miles to the north of his nativevillage.  Here he passed through the dreadful ordeal to which aprinter's "devil" is generally subjected.  He always kept histemper; and his eccentric boy jokes are even now told by theresidents of Skowhegan.In the spring, after his fifteenth birthday, Charles Browne badefarewell to the "Skowhegan Clarion;" and we next hear of him inthe office of the "Carpet-Bag," edited by B.P. Shillaber ("Mrs.Partington").  Lean, lank, but strangely appreciative, youngBrowne used to "set up" articles from the pens of Charles G.Halpine ("Miles O'Reilly") and John G. Saxe, the poet.  Here hewrote his first contribution in a disguised hand, slyly put itinto the editorial box, and the next day disguised his pleasurewhile setting it up himself.  The article was a description of aFourth of July celebration in Skowhegan.  The spectacle of theday was a representation of the battle of Yorktown, with G.Washington and General Horace Cornwallis in character.  Thearticle pleased Mr. Shillaber, and Mr. Browne, afterwardsspeaking of it, said:  "I went to the theatre that evening, had agood time of it, and thought I was the greatest man in Boston."While engaged on the "Carpet-Bag," the subject of our sketchclosely studied the theatre and courted the society of actors andactresses.  It was in this way that he gained that correct andvaluable knowledge of the texts and characters of the drama,which enabled him in after years to burlesque them sosuccessfully.  The humorous writings of Seba Smith were hismodels, and the oddities of "John Phoenix" were his especialadmiration.Being of a roving temper Charles Browne soon left Boston, and,after traveling as a journeyman printer over much of New York andMassachusetts, he turned up in the town of Tiffin, Seneca County,Ohio, where he became reporter and compositor at four dollars perweek.  After making many friends among the good citizens ofTiffin, by whom he is remembered as a patron of side shows andtraveling circuses, our hero suddenly set out for Toledo, on thelake, where he immediately made a reputation as a writer ofsarcastic paragraphs in the columns of the Toledo "Commercial."He waged a vigorous newspaper war with the reporters of theToledo "Blade," but while the "Blade" indulged in violentvituperation, "Artemus" was good-natured and full of humor.  Hiscolumn soon gained a local fame and everybody read it.  His fameeven traveled away to Cleveland, where, in 1858, when Mr. Brownewas twenty-four years of age, Mr. J.W. Gray of the Cleveland"Plaindealer" secured him as local reporter, at a salary oftwelve-dollars per week.  Here his reputation first began toassume a national character and it was here that they called hima "fool" when he mentioned the idea of taking the field as alecturer.  Speaking of this circumstance while traveling down theMississippi with the writer, in 1865, Mr. Browne musinglyrepeated this colloquy:WISE MAN:--"Ah! you poor foolish little girl--here is a dollarfor you."FOOLISH LITTLE GIRL:--"Thank you, sir; but I have a sister athome as foolish as I am; can't you give me a dollar for her?"Charles Browne was not successful as a NEWS reporter, lackingenterprise and energy, but his success lay in writing up in aburlesque manner well-known public affairs like prize-fights,races, spiritual meetings, and political gatherings.  Hisdepartment became wonderfully humorous, and was always a favoritewith readers, whether there was any news in it or not.  Sometimeshe would have a whole column of letters from young ladies inreply to a fancied matrimonial advertisement, and then he wouldhave a column of answers to general correspondents like this:--VERITAS:--Many make the same error.  Mr. Key, who wrote the "StarSpangled Banner," is not the author of Hamlet, a tragedy.  Hewrote the banner business, and assisted in "The Female Pirate,"BUT DID NOT WRITE HAMLET.  Hamlet was written by a talented butunscrupulous man named Macbeth, afterwards tried and executed for"murdering sleep."YOUNG CLERGYMAN:--Two pints of rum, two quarts of hot water, tea-cup of sugar, and a lemon; grate in nutmeg, stir thoroughly anddrink while hot.It was during his engagement on the "Plaindealer" that he wrote,dating from Indiana, his first communication,--the firstpublished letter following this sketch, signed "Artemus Ward" asobriquet purely incidental, but borne with the "u" changed to an"a" by an American revolutionary general.  It was here that Mr.Browne first became, IN WORDS, the possessor of a moral show"consisting of three moral bares, the a kangaroo (a amoozinglittle rascal; 'twould make you larf yourself to death to see thelittle kuss jump and squeal), wax figures of G. Washington, &c.&c."  Hundreds of newspapers copied this letter, and CharlesBrowne awoke one morning to find himself famous.In the "Plaindealer" office, his companion, George Hoyt, writes:"His desk was a rickety table which had been whittled and gasheduntil it looked as if it had been the victim of lightning.  Hischair was a fit companion thereto,--a wabbling, unsteady affair,sometimes with four and sometimes with three legs.  But Brownesaw neither the table, nor the chair, nor any person who might benear, nothing, in fact, but the funny pictures which weretumbling out of his brain.  When writing, his gaunt form lookedridiculous enough.  One leg hung over the arm of his chair like agreat hook, while he would write away, sometimes laughing tohimself, and then slapping the table in the excess of his mirth."While in the office of the "Plaindealer," Mr. Browne firstconceived the idea of becoming a lecturer.  In attending thevarious minstrel shows and circuses which came to the city, hewould frequently hear repeated some story of his own which theaudience would receive with hilarity.  His best witticisms cameback to him from the lips of another who made a living by quotinga stolen jest.  Then the thought came to him to enter the lecturefield himself, and become the utterer of his own witticisms--themouthpiece of his own jests.On the 10th of November, 1860, Charles Browne, whose fame,traveling in his letters from Boston to San Francisco, had nowbecome national, grasped the hands of his hundreds of New Yorkadmirers.  Cleveland had throned him the monarch of mirth, and athousand hearts paid him tributes of adulation as he closed hisconnection with the Cleveland Press.Arriving in the Empire City, Mr. Browne soon opened an engagementwith "Vanity Fair," a humorous paper after the manner of London"Punch," and ere long he succeeded Mr. Charles G. Leland aseditor.  Mr. Charles Dawson Shanly says:  "After Artemus Wardbecame sole editor, a position which he held for a brief period,many of his best contributions were given to the public; and,whatever there was of merit in the columns of "Vanity Fair" fromthe time he assumed the editorial charge, emanated from his pen."Mr. Browne himself wrote to a friend:  "Comic copy is what theywanted for "Vanity Fair."  I wrote some and it killed it.  Thepoor paper got to be a conundrum, and so I gave it up."The idea of entering the field as a lecturer now seized Mr.Browne stronger than ever.  Tired of the pen, he resolved ontrying the platform.  His Bohemian friends agreed that his fameand fortune would be made before intelligent audiences.  Heresolved to try it.  What should be the subject of my lecture?How shall I treat the subject?  These questions caused Mr. Brownegrave speculations.  Among other schemes, he thought of a stringof jests combined with a stream of satire, the whole beingunconnected--a burlesque upon a lecture.  The subject,--that wasa hard question.  First he thought of calling it "My SevenGrandmothers," but he finally adopted the name of "Babes in theWoods," and with this subject Charles Browne was introduced to ametropolitan audience, on the evening of December 23d, 1861.  Theplace was Clinton Hall, which stood on the site of the old AstorPlace Opera House, where years ago occurred the Macready riot,and where now is the Mercantile Library.  Previous to thisintroduction, Mr. Frank Wood accompanied him to the suburban townof Norwich, Connecticut, where he first delivered his lecture,and watched the result.  The audience was delighted, and Mr.Browne received an ovation.  Previous to his Clinton Hallappearance the city was flooded with funny placards reading--                      ARTEMUS WARD                          WILL                      SPEAK A PIECE.Owing to a great storm, only a small audience braved theelements, and the Clinton Hall lecture was not a financialsuccess.  It consisted of a wandering batch of comicalities,touching upon everything except "The Babes."  Indeed it wasbetter described by the lecturer in London, when he said, "One ofthe features of my entertainment is, that it contains so manythings that don't have anything to do with it."In the middle of his lecture, the speaker would hesitate, stop,and say:  "Owing to a slight indisposition we will now have anintermission of fifteen minutes."  The audience looked in utterdismay at the idea of staring at vacancy for a quarter of anhour, when, rubbing his hands, the lecturer would continue:"but, ah--during the intermission I will go on with my lecture!"Mr. Browne's first volume, entitled "Artemus Ward; His Book," waspublished in New York, May 17th, 1862.  The volume was everywherehailed with enthusiasm, and over forty thousand copies were sold.Great success also attended the sale of his three other volumespublished in '65, '67, and '69.Mr. Browne's next lecture was entitled "Sixty Minutes in Africa,"and was delivered in Musical Fund Hall, Philadelphia.  Behind himhung a large map of Africa, "which region," said Artemus,"abounds in various natural productions, such as reptiles andflowers.  It produces the red rose, the white rose, and the neg-roes.  In the middle of the continent is what is called a'howling wilderness,' but, for my part, I have never heard ithowl, nor met with any one who has."After Mr. Browne had created immense enthusiasm for his lecturesand books in the Eastern States, which filled his pockets with ahandsome exchequer, he started, October 3d, 1863, for California,a faithful account of which trip is given by himself in thisbook.  Previous to starting, he received a telegram from ThomasMaguire, of the San Francisco Opera House, inquiring "what hewould TAKE FOR FORTY NIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA."  Mr. Brownimmediately telegraphed back,--                   "Brandy and water.                              A. Ward."And, though Maguire was sorely puzzled at the contents of thedispatch, the Press got hold of it, and it went throughCalifornia as a capital joke.Mr. Browne first lectured in San Francisco on "The Babes in theWoods," November 13th, 1863, at Pratt's Hall.  T. Starr King tooka deep interest in him, occupying the rostrum, and his generalreception in San Francisco was warm.Returning overland, through Salt Lake to the States, in the fallof 1864, Mr. Browne lectured again in New York, this time on the"Mormons," to immense audiences, and in the spring of 1865 hecommenced his tour through the country, everywhere drawingenthusiastic audiences both North and South.It was while on this tour that the writer of this sketch againspent some time with him.  We met at Memphis and traveled downthe Mississippi together.  At Lake Providence the "Indiana"rounded up to our landing, and Mr. Browne accompanied the writerto his plantation, where he spent several days, mingling inseeming infinite delight with the negroes.  For them he showedgreat fondness, and they used to stand around him in crowdslistening to his seemingly serious advice.  We could not prevailupon him to hunt or to join in any of the equestrian amusementswith the neighboring planters, but a quiet fascination drew himto the negroes.  Strolling through the "quarters," his gravewords, too deep with humor for darkey comprehension, gainedtheir entire confidence.  One day he called up Uncle Jeff., anUncle-Tom-like patriarch, and commenced in his usual vein:  "Now,Uncle Jefferson," he said, "why do you thus pursue the habits ofindustry?  This course of life is wrong--all wrong--all a basehabit, Uncle Jefferson.  Now try to break it off.  Look at me,--look at Mr. Landon, the chivalric young Southern plantist FROMNEW YORK, he toils not, neither does he spin; he pursues a careerof contented idleness.  If you only thought so, Jefferson, youcould live for months WITHOUT PERFORMING ANY KIND OF LABOR, andat the expiration of that time FEEL FRESH AND VIGOROUS ENOUGH TOCOMMENCE IT AGAIN.  Idleness refreshes the physical organization--IT IS A SWEET BOON!  Strike at the roots of the destroying habitto-day, Jefferson.  It tires you out; resolve to be idle; no oneshould labor; HE SHOULD HIRE OTHERS TO DO IT FOR HIM;" and thenhe would fix his mournful eyes on Jeff. and hand him a dollar,while the eyes of the wonder-struck darkey would gaze in muteadmiration upon the good and wise originator of the only theorywhich the darkey mind could appreciate.  As Jeff. went away totell the wonderful story to his companions, and backed it withthe dollar as material proof, Artemus would cover his eyes, andbend forward on his elbows in a chuckling laugh."Among the Mormons" was delivered through the States, everywheredrawing immense crowds.  His manner of delivering his discoursewas grotesque and comical beyond description.  His quaint and sadstyle contributed more than anything else to render hisentertainment exquisitely funny.  The programme was exceedinglydroll, and the tickets of admission presented the most ludicrousof ideas.  The writer presents a fac-simile of an admissionticket which was presented to him in Natchez by Mr. Browne:--                   ADMIT THE BEARER                     AND ONE WIFE.                           YOURS TROOLY,                                 A. WARD.In the spring of 1866, Charles Browne first timidly thought ofgoing to Europe.  Turning to Mr. Hingston one day he asked:"What sort of a man is Albert Smith?  Do you think the Mormonswould be as good a subject to the Londoners as Mont Blanc was?"Then he said:  "I should like to go to London and give my lecturein the same place.  Can't it be done?"Mr. Browne sailed for England soon after, taking with him hisPanorama.  The success that awaited him could scarcely have beenanticipated by his most intimate friends.  Scholars, wits, poets,and novelists came to him with extended hands, and his stay inLondon was one ovation to the genius of American wit.  CharlesReade, the novelist, was his warm friend and enthusiasticadmirer; and Mr. Andrew Haliday introduced him to the "LiteraryClub," where he became a great favorite.  Mark Lemon came to himand asked him to become a contributor to "Punch," which he did.His "Punch" letters were more remarked in literary circles thanany other current matter.  There was hardly a club-meeting or adinner at which they were not discussed.  "There was something sogrotesque in the idea," said a correspondent, "of this ruthlessYankee poking among the revered antiquities of Britain, that thebeef-eating British themselves could not restrain their laughter."The story of his Uncle William who "followed commercial pursuits,glorious commerce--and sold soap," and his letters on the Towerand "Chowser," were palpable hits, and it was admitted that"Punch" had contained nothing better since the days of"Yellowplush."  This opinion was shared by the "Times," theliterary reviews, and the gayest leaders of society.  Thepublishers of "Punch" posted up his name in large letters overtheir shop in Fleet Street, and Artemus delighted to point it outto his friends.  About this time Mr. Browne wrote to his friendJack Rider, of Cleveland:"This is the proudest moment of my life.  To have been as wellappreciated here as at home; to have written for the oldest comicJournal in the English language, received mention with Hood, withJerrold and Hook, and to have my picture and my pseudonym ascommon in London as in New York, is enough for                                         "Yours truly,                                                "A. Ward."England was thoroughly aroused to the merits of Artemus Ward,before he commenced his lectures at Egyptian Hall, and when, inNovember, he finally appeared, immense crowds were compelled toturn away.  At every lecture his fame increased, and whensickness brought his brilliant success to an end, a nationmourned his retirement.On the evening of Friday, the seventh week of his engagement atEgyptian Hall, Artemus became seriously ill, an apology was madeto a disappointed audience, and from that time the light of oneof the greatest wits of the centuries commenced fading intodarkness.  The Press mourned his retirement, and a funeral pallfell over London.  The laughing, applauding crowds were soon tosee his consumptive form moving towards its narrow resting-placein the cemetery at Kensal Green.By medical advice Charles Browne went for a short time to theIsland of Jersey--but the breezes of Jersey were powerless.  Hewrote to London to his nearest and dearest friends--the membersof a literary club of which he was a member--to complain that his"loneliness weighed on him."  He was brought back, but could notsustain the journey farther than Southampton.  There the membersof the club traveled from London to see him--two at a time--thathe might be less lonely.His remains were followed to the grave from the rooms of hisfriend Arthur Sketchley, by a large number of friends andadmirers, the literati and press of London paying the lasttribute of respect to their dead brother.  The funeral serviceswere conducted by the Rev. M.D. Conway, formerly of Cincinnati,and the coffin was temporarily placed in a vault, from which itwas removed by his American friends, and his body now sleeps bythe side of his father, Levi Browne, in the quiet cemetery atWaterford, Maine.  Upon the coffin is the simple inscription:--                    "CHARLES F. BROWNE,                      AGED 32 YEARS,          Better Known to the World as 'Artemus Ward.'"His English executors were T.W. Robertson, the playwright, andhis friend and companion, E.P. Hingston.  His literary executorswere Horace Greeley and Richard H. Stoddard.  In his will, hebequeathed among other things a large sum of money to his littlevalet, a bright little fellow; though subsequent denoumentsrevealed the fact that he left only a six-thousand-dollar housein Yonkers.  There is still some mystery about his finances,which may one day be revealed.  It is known that he withdrew10,000 dollars from the Pacific Bank to deposit it with a friendbefore going to England; besides this, his London "Punch" letterspaid a handsome profit.  Among his personal friends were GeorgeHoyt, the late Daniel Setchell, Charles W.  Coe, and Mr. Mullen,the artist, all of whom he used to style "my friends all the yearround."Personally Charles Farrar Browne was one of the kindest and mostaffectionate of men, and history does not name a man who was souniversally beloved by all who knew him.  It was remarked, andtruly, that the death of no literary character since WashingtonIrving caused such general and widespread regret.In stature he was tall and slender.  His nose was prominent,--outlined like that of Sir Charles Napier, or Mr. Seward; his eyesbrilliant, small, and close together; his mouth large, teethwhite and pearly; fingers long and slender; hair soft, straight,and blonde; complexion florid; mustache large, and his voice softand clear.  In bearing, he moved like a natural-born gentleman.In his lectures he never smiled--not even while he was givingutterance to the most delicious absurdities; but all the whilethe jokes fell from his lips as if he was unconscious of theirmeaning.  While writing his lectures, he would laugh and chuckleto himself continually.There was one peculiarity about Charles Browne--HE NEVER MADE ANENEMY.  Other wits in other times have been famous, but asatirical thrust now and then has killed a friend.  Diogenes wasthe wit of Greece, but when, after holding up an old dried fishto draw away the eyes of Anaximenes' audience, he exclaimed "Seehow an old fish is more interesting than Anaximenes," he said afunny thing, but he stabbed a friend.  When Charles Lamb, inanswer to the doting mother's question as to how he liked babies,replied, "b-b-boiled, madam, BOILED!" that mother loved him nomore:  and when John Randolph said "THANK YOU!" to hisconstituent who kindly remarked that he had the pleasure ofPASSING his house, it was wit at the expense of friendship.  Thewhole English school of wits--with Douglas Jerrold, Hood,Sheridan, and Sidney Smith, indulged in repartee.  They werePARASITIC wits.  And so with the Irish, except that an Irishmanis generally so ridiculously absurd in his replies as to onlyexcite ridicule.  "Artemus Ward" made you laugh and love him too.The wit of "Artemus Ward" and "Josh Billings" is distinctivelyAmerican.  Lord Kames, in his "Elements of Criticism," makes nomention of this species of wit, a lack which the futurerhetorician should look to.  We look in vain for it in theEnglish language of past ages, and in other languages of moderntime.  It is the genus American.  When Artemus says in thatserious manner, looking admiringly at his atrocious pictures,--"Ilove pictures--and I have many of them--beautiful photographs--ofmyself;" you smile; and when he continues, "These pictures werepainted by the Old Masters; they painted these pictures and thenthey--they expired;" you hardly know what it is that makes youlaugh outright; and when Josh Billings says in his Proverbs,wiser than Solomon's "You'd better not know so much, than know somany things that ain't so;"--the same vein is struck, but thetext-books fail to explain scientifically the cause of our mirth.The wit of Charles Browne is of the most exalted kind.  It isonly scholars and those thoroughly acquainted with the SUBTILTYof our language who fully appreciate it.  His wit is generallyabout historical personages like Cromwell, Garrick, orShakspeare, or a burlesque on different styles of writing, likehis French novel, when hifalutin phrases of tragedy come from theclodhopper who--"sells soap and thrice--refuses a ducal coronet."Mr. Browne mingled the eccentric even in his business letters.Once he wrote to his Publisher, Mr. G.W. Carleton, who had madesome alterations in his MSS.:  "The next book I write I'm goingto get YOU to write."  Again he wrote in 1863:"Dear Carl:--You and I will get out a book next spring, whichwill knock spots out of all comic books in ancient or modernhistory.  And the fact that you are going to take hold of itconvinces me that you have one of the most MASSIVE intellects ofthis or any other epoch."Yours, my pretty gazelle,"A. Ward."When Charles F. Browne died, he did not belong to America, for,as with Irving and Dickens, the English language claimed him.Greece alone did not suffer when the current of Diogenes' witflowed on to death.  Spain alone did not mourn when Cervantes,dying, left Don Quixote, the "knight of la Mancha."  When CharlesLamb ceased to tune the great heart of humanity to joy andgladness, his funeral was in every English and American household; and when Charles Browne took up his silent resting-place in thesombre shades of Kensal Green, JESTING CEASED, and one greatAnglo-American heart,             Like a muffled drum went beating               Funeral marches to his grave.                                  MELVILLE D. LANDON.INTRODUCTION  BY T.W. ROBERTSON.Few tasks are more difficult or delicate than to write on thesubject of the works or character of a departed friend.  The penfalters as the familiar face looks out of the paper.  The mind isdiverted from the thought of death as the memory recalls some happyepigram.  It seems so strange that the hand that traced the jokesshould be cold, that the tongue that trolled out the good thingsshould be silent--that the jokes and the good things should remain,and the man who made them should be gone for ever.The works of Charles Farrar Browne--who was known to the world as"Artemus Ward"--have run through so many editions, have met withsuch universal popularity, and have been so widely criticised, thatit is needless to mention them here.  So many biographies have beenwritten of the gentleman who wrote in the character of the 'cuteYankee Showman, that it is unnecessary that I should touch upon hislife, belongings, or adventures.  Of "Artemus Ward" I know just asmuch as the rest of the world.  I prefer, therefore, to speak ofCharles Farrar Browne, as I knew him, and, in doing so, I canpromise those friends who also knew him and esteemed him, that as Iconsider no "public" man so public, that some portion of his work,pleasures, occupations, and habits may not be considered private, Ishall only mention how kind and noble-minded was the man of whom Iwrite, without dragging forward special and particular acts in proofof my words, as if the goodness of his mind and character needed thecertificate of facts.I first saw Charles Browne at a literary club; he had only been afew hours in London, and he seemed highly pleased and excited atfinding himself in the old city to which his thoughts had so oftenwandered.  Browne was an intensely sympathetic man.  His brain andfeelings were as a "lens," and he received impressions immediately.No man could see him without liking him at once.  His manner wasstraightforward and genial, and had in it the dignity of agentleman, tempered, as it were, by the fun of the humorist.  Whenyou heard him talk you wanted to make much of him, not because hewas "Artemus Ward," but because he was himself, for no one lessresembled "Artemus Ward" than his author and creator, Charles FarrarBrowne.  But a few weeks ago it was remarked to me that authors werea disappointing race to know, and I agreed with the remark, and Iremember a lady once said to me that the personal appearance ofpoets seldom "came up" to their works.  To this I replied that,after all, poets were but men, and that it was as unreasonable toexpect that the late Sir Walter Scott could at all resemble aGathering of the Clans as that the late Lord Macaulay should appearanything like the Committal of the Seven Bishops to the Tower.  Itold the lady that she was unfair to eminent men if she hoped thatcelebrated engineers would look like tubular bridges, or that SirEdwin Landseer would remind her of a "Midsummer Night's Dream."  Imention this because, of all men in the world, my friend CharlesBrowne was the least like a showman of any man I ever encountered.I can remember the odd half disappointed look of some of thevisitors to the Egyptian Hall when "Artemus" stepped upon theplatform.  At first they thought that he was a gentleman whoappeared to apologise for the absence of the showman.  They hadpictured to themselves a coarse old man, with a damp eye and apuckered mouth, one eyebrow elevated an inch above the other toexpress shrewdness and knowledge of the world--a man clad invelveteen and braid, with a heavy watch-chain, large rings, andhorny hands, the touter to a waxwork show, with a hoarse voice, andover familiar manner.  The slim gentleman in evening dress, polishedmanners, and gentle voice, with a tone of good breeding that hoveredbetween deference and jocosity; the owner of those thin--those muchtoo thin--white hands could not be the man who spelt joke with a"g."  Folks who came to laugh, began to fear that they should remainto be instructed, until the gentlemanly disappointer began to speak,then they recovered their real "Artemus," Betsy Jane, wax-figgers,and all.  Will patriotic Americans forgive me if I say that CharlesBrowne loved England dearly!  He had been in London but a few dayswhen he paid a visit to the Tower.  He knew English history betterthan most Englishmen; and the Tower of London was to him the historyof England embalmed in stone and mortar.  No man had more reverencein his nature; and at the Tower he saw that what he had read wasreal.  There were the beef-eaters; there had been Queen Elizabethand Sir Walter Raleigh, and Lady Jane Grey, and Shakspere's murderedprinces, and their brave, cruel uncle.  There was the block and theaxe, and the armour and the jewels.  "St George for Merrie England!"had been shouted in the Holy Land, and men of the same blood ashimself had been led against the infidel by men of the same brainand muscle as George Washington.  Robin Hood was a reality, and nota schoolboy's myth like Ali Baba and Valentine and Orson.There were two sets of feelings in Charles Browne at the Tower.  Hecould appreciate the sublimity of history, but, as the "Show" partof the exhibition was described to him, the humorist, the wit, andthe iconoclast from the other side the Atlantic must have smiled atthe "descriptions."  The "Tower" was a "show," like his own--ArtemusWard's.  A price was paid for admission, and the "figgers" were"orated."  Real jewellery is very like sham jewellery after all, andthe "Artemus" vein in Charles Browne's mental constitution--the veinof humour, whose source was a strong contempt of all things false,mean, shabby, pretentious, and only external--of bunkum andBarnumisation--must have seen a gigantic speculation realisingshiploads of dollars if the Tower could have been taken over to theStates, and exhibited from town to town--the Stars and Stripes flyingover it--with a four-horse lecture to describe the barbarity of theancient British Barons and the cuss of chivalry.Artemus Ward's Lecture on the Mormons at the Egyptian Hall,Piccadilly, was a great success.  His humour was so entirely fresh,new, and unconventional, it took his hearers by surprise, andcharmed them.  His failing health compelled him to abandon thelecture after about eight or ten weeks.  Indeed, during that briefperiod he was once or twice compelled to dismiss his audience.  Ihave myself seen him sink into a chair and nearly faint after theexertion of dressing.  He exhibited the greatest anxiety to be athis post at the appointed time, and scrupulously exerted himself tothe utmost to entertain his auditors.  It was not because he wassick that the public was to be disappointed, or that their enjoymentwas to be diminished.  During the last few weeks of hislecture-giving he steadily abstained from accepting any of thenumerous invitations he received.  Had he lived through thefollowing London fashionable season, there is little doubt that theroom at the Egyptian Hall would have been thronged nightly.  Ouraristocracy have a fine delicate sense of humour, and the success,artistic and pecuniary, of "Artemus Ward" would have rivalled thatof the famous "Lord Dundreary."  There are many stupid people whodid not understand the "fun" of Artemus Ward's books.  In theirvernacular "they didn't see it."  There were many stupid people whodid not understand the fun of Artemus Ward's lecture on the Mormons.They could not see it.  Highly respectable people--the pride oftheir parish, when they heard of a lecture "upon the Mormons"--expected to see a solemn person, full of old saws and newstatistics, who would denounce the sin of polygamy, and bray againstpolygamists with four-and-twenty boiling-water Baptist power ofdenunciation.  These uncomfortable Christians do not like humour.They dread it as a certain personage is said to dread holy water,and for the same reason that thieves fear policemen--it finds themout.  When these good idiots heard Artemus offer, if they did notlike the lecture in Piccadilly, to give them free tickets for thesame lecture in California, when he next visited that country, theyturned to each other indignantly, and said "What use are tickets forCalifornia to us?  We are not going to California.  No! we are toogood, too respectable, to go so far from home.  The man is a fool!"One of these ornaments of the vestry complained to the doorkeepers,and denounced the lecture as an imposition; "and," said the wealthyparishioner, "as for the panorama, it's the worst painted thing Iever saw in all my life!"But the entertainment, original, humorous, and racy though it was,was drawing to a close!  In the fight between youth and death, deathwas to conquer.  By medical advice Charles Browne went for a shorttime to Jersey--but the breezes of Jersey were powerless.  He wroteto London to his nearest and dearest friends--the members of aliterary club of which he was a member--to complain that his"loneliness weighed on him."  He was brought back, but could notsustain the journey farther than Southampton.  There the members ofthe beforementioned club travelled from London to see him--two at atime--that he might be less lonely--and for the unwearyingsolicitude of his friend and agent, Mr. Hingston, and to the kindlysympathy of the United States Consul at Southampton, CharlesBrowne's best and dearest friends had cause to be grateful.  Icannot close these lines without mention of "Artemus Ward's" lastjoke.  He had read in the newspapers that a wealthy American hadoffered to present the Prince of Wales with a splendid yacht,American built."It seems," said the invalid, "a fashion now-a-days for everybody topresent the Prince of Wales with something.  I think I shall leavehim--my panorama!"Charles Browne died beloved and regretted by all who knew him, andby many who had known him but a few weeks; and when he drew his lastbreath, there passed away the Spirit of a true gentleman.                                           T.W. ROBERTSONLondon, August 11, 1868.PREFATORY NOTE                   BY EDWARD P. HINGSTON.In Cleveland, Ohio, the pleasant city beside the lakes, Artemus Wardfirst determined to become a public lecturer.  He and I rambledthrough Cleveland together after his return from California.  Hecalled on some old friends at the Herald office, then went over tothe Weddel House, and afterwards strolled across to the offices ofthe "Plain Dealer", where, in his position as sub-editor, he hadwritten many of his earlier essays.  Artemus inquired for Mr. Gray,the editor, who chanced to be absent.  Looking round at the vacantdesks and inkstained furniture, Artemus was silent for a minute ortwo, and then burst into one of those peculiar chuckling fits oflaughter in which he would occasionally indulge; not a loud laugh,but a shaking of the whole body with an impulse of merriment whichset every muscle in motion.  "Here," said he, "here's where theycalled me a fool."  The remembrance of their so calling him seemedto afford him intense amusement.>From the office of the Cleveland Plain Dealer we continued our tourof the town.  Presently we found ourselves in front of Perry'sstatue, the monument erected to commemorate the naval engagement onLake Erie, wherein the Americans came off victorious.  Artemuslooked up to the statue, laid his finger to the side of his nose,and, in his quaint manner, remarked, "I wonder whether they calledhim 'a fool' too, when he went to fight!"The remark, following close as it did upon his laughing fit in thenewspaper office, caused me to inquire why he had been called "afool," and who had called him so."It was the opinion of my friends on the paper," he replied.  "Itold them that I was going in for lecturing.  They laughed at me,and called me `a fool.'  Don't you think they were right?"Then we sauntered up Euclid Street, under the shade of its avenue oftrees.  As we went along, Artemus Ward recounted to me the story ofhis becoming a lecturer.  Our conversation on that agreeable eveningis fresh in my remembrance.  Memory still listens to the voice of mycompanion in the stroll, still sees the green trees of Euclid Streetcasting their shadows across our path, and still joins in the laughwith Artemus, who, having just returned from California, where hehad taken sixteen hundred dollars at one lecture, did not think thatto be evidence of his having lost his senses.The substance of that which Artemus Ward then told me was, thatwhile writing for the "Cleveland Plain Dealer" he was accustomed, inthe discharge of his duties as a reporter, to attend theperformances of the various minstrel troups and circuses whichvisited the neighbourhood.  At one of these he would hear some storyof his own, written a month or two previously, given by the"middle-man" of the minstrels and received with hilarity by theaudience.  At another place he would be entertained by listening tojokes of his own invention, coarsely retailed by the clown of thering, and shouted at by the public as capital waggery on the part ofthe performer.  His own good things from the lips of another "cameback to him with alienated majesty," as Emerson expresses it.  Thenthe thought would steal over him--Why should that man gain a livingwith my witticisms, and I not use them in the same way myself? whynot be the utterer of my own coinage, the quoter of my own jests,the mouthpiece of my own merry conceits?  Certainly, it was not avery exalted ambition to aim at the glories of a circus clown or thetriumphs of a minstrel with a blackened face.  But, in the UnitedStates a somewhat different view is taken of that which is fittingand seemly for a man to do, compared with the estimate we form inthis country.  In a land where the theory of caste is not admitted,the relative respectability of the various professions is not quitethe same as it is with us.  There the profession does not disqualifyif the man himself be right, nor the claim to the title of gentlemandepend upon the avocation followed.  I know of one or two clowns inthe ring who are educated physicians, and not thought to be any theless gentlemen because they propound conundrums and perpetrate jestsinstead of prescribing pills and potions.Artemus Ward was always very self-reliant; when once he believedhimself to be in the right it was almost impossible to persuade himto the contrary.  But, at the same time, he was cautious in theextreme, and would well consider his position before deciding thatwhich was right or wrong for him to do.  The idea of becoming apublic man having taken possession of his mind, the next point todecide was in what form he should appear before the public.  That ofa humorous lecturer seemed to him to be the best.  It was unoccupiedground.  America had produced entertainers who by means of facialchanges or eccentricities of costume had contrived to amuse theiraudiences, but there was no one who ventured to joke for an hourbefore a house full of people with no aid from scenery or dress.The experiment was one which Artemus resolved to try.  Accordingly,he set himself to work to collect all his best quips and cranks, toinvent what new drolleries he could, and to remember all the goodthings that he had heard or met with.  These he noted down andstrung together almost without relevancy or connexion.  Themanuscript chanced to fall into the hands of the people at theoffice of the newspaper on which he was then employed, and thequestion was put to him of what use he was going to make of thestrange jumble of jest which he had thus compiled.  His answer wasthat he was about to turn lecturer, and that before them were thematerials of his lecture.  It was then that his friends laughed athim, and characterised him as "a fool.""They had some right to think so," said Artemus to me as we rambledup Euclid Street.  "I half thought that I was one myself.  I don'tlook like a lecturer--do I?"He was always fond, poor fellow, of joking on the subject of hispersonal appearance.  His spare figure and tall stature, hisprominent nose and his light-colored hair, were each made thesubject of a joke at one time or another in the course of hislecturing career.  If he laughed largely at the foibles of others,he was equally disposed to laugh at any shortcomings he could detectin himself.  If anything at all in his outward form was to him asource of vanity, it was the delicate formation of his hands.White, soft, long, slender, and really handsome, they were more likethe hands of a high-born lady than those of a Western editor.  Heattended to them with careful pride, and never alluded to them as asubject for his jokes, until, in his last illness, they had becomeunnaturally fair, translucent, and attenuated.  Then it was that afriend calling upon him at his apartments in Piccadilly, endeavouredto cheer him at a time of great mental depression, and pleasantlyreminded him of a ride they had long ago projected through theSouth-Western States of the Union.  "We must do that ride yet,Artemus.  Short stages at first, and longer ones as we go on."  PoorArtemus lifted up his pale, slender hands, and letting the lightshine through them, said jocosely, "Do you think these would do tohold a rein with?   Why, the horse would laugh at them."Having collected a sufficient number of quaint thoughts, whimsicalfancies, bizarre notions, and ludicrous anecdotes, the difficultywhich then, according to his own confession, occurred to ArtemusWard was, what should be the title of his lecture.  The subject wasno difficulty at all, for the simple reason that there was not to beany.  The idea of instructing or informing his audience never onceentered into his plans.  His intention was merely to amuse; ifpossible, keep the house in continuous laughter for an hour and ahalf, or rather an hour and twenty minutes, for that was the precisetime, in his belief, which people could sit to listen and to laughwithout becoming bored; and, if possible, send his audience homewell pleased with the lecturer and with themselves, without theirhaving any clear idea of that which they had been listening to, andnot one jot the wiser than when they came.  No one better understoodthan Artemus the wants of a miscellaneous audience who paid theirdollar or half-dollar each to be amused.  No one could gauge betterthan he the capacity of the crowd to feed on pure fun, and no onecould discriminate more clearly than he the fitness, temper, andmental appetite of the constituents of his evening assemblies.  Theprosiness of an ordinary Mechanics' Institute lecture was to himsimply abhorrent; the learned platitudes of a professed lecturerwere to him, to use one of his own phrases, "worse than poison."  Tomake people laugh was to be his primary endeavour.  If in so makingthem laugh he could also cause them to see through a sham, beashamed of some silly national prejudice, or suspicious of the valueof some current piece of political bunkum, so much the better.  Hebelieved in laughter as thoroughly wholesome; he had the firmestconviction that fun is healthy, and sportiveness the truest sign ofsanity.  Like Talleyrand, he was of opinion that "Qui vit sans jolien'est pas si sage qu'il croit."Artemus Ward's first lecture was entitled "The Babes in the Wood."I asked him why he chose that title, because there was nothingwhatever in the lecture relevant to the subject of the child-booklegend.  He replied, "It seemed to sound the best.  I once thoughtof calling the lecture 'My Seven Grandmothers.'  Don't you thinkthat would have been good?"  It would at any rate have been just aspertinent.Incongruity as an element of fun was always an idea uppermost in themind of the Western humorist.  I am not aware that the notes of anyof his lectures, except those of his Mormon experience, have beenpreserved, and I have some doubts if any one of his lectures, exceptthe Mormon one, was ever fairly written out.  "The Babes in theWood," as a lecture, was a pure and unmitigated "sell."  It wasmerely joke after joke, and drollery succeeding to drollery, withoutany connecting thread whatever.  It was an exhibition of fireworks,owing half its brilliancy and more than half its effect to the skillof the man who grouped the fireworks together and let them off.  Inthe hands of any other pyrotechnist the squibs would have failed tolight, the rockets would have refused to ascend, and the"nine-bangers" would have exploded but once or twice only, insteadof nine times.  The artist of the display being no more, and thefireworks themselves having gone out, it is perhaps not to beregretted that the cases of the squibs and the tubes of the rocketshave not been carefully kept.  Most of the good things introduced byArtemus Ward in his first lecture were afterwards incorporated byhim in subsequent writings, or used over again in his laterentertainment.  Many of them had reference to the events of the day,the circumstances of the American War and the politics of the GreatRebellion.  These, of course, have lost their interest with thepassing away of the times which gave them birth.  The points of manyof the jokes have corroded, and the barbed head of many an arrow ofArtemus's wit has rusted into bluntness with the decay of the bowfrom which it was propelled.If I remember rightly, the "Babes in the Wood" were never mentionedmore than twice in the whole lecture.  First, when the lecturer toldhis audience that the "Babes" were to constitute the subject of hisdiscourse, and then digressed immediately to matters quite foreignto the story.  Then again at the conclusion of the hour and twentyminutes of drollery, when he finished up in this way: "I now come tomy subject 'The Babes in the Wood.'"  Here he would take out hiswatch, look at it with affected surprise, put on an appearance ofbeing greatly perplexed, and amidst roars of laughter from thepeople, very gravely continue, "But I find that I have exceeded mytime, and will therefore merely remark that, so far as I know, theywere very good babes--they were as good as ordinary babes.  I reallyhave not time to go into their history.  You will find it all in thestory-books.  They died in the woods, listening to the woodpeckertapping the hollow beech-tree.  It was a sad fate for them, and Ipity them.  So, I hope, do you.  Good night!"Artemus gave his first lecture at Norwich in Connecticut, andtravelled over a considerable portion of the Eastern States beforehe ventured to give a sample of his droll oratory in the Westerncities, wherein he had earned reputation as a journalist.  Graduallyhis popularity became very great, and in place of letting himselfout at so much per night to literary societies and athenaeums, heconstituted himself his own showman, engaging that indispensableadjunct to all showmen in the United States, an agent to go ahead,engage halls, arrange for the sale of tickets, and engineer thesuccess of the show.  Newspapers had carried his name to everyvillage of the Union, and his writings had been largely quoted inevery journal.  It required, therefore, comparatively littleadvertising to announce his visit to any place in which he had tolecture.  But it was necessary that he should have a bill or posterof some kind.  The one he adopted was simple, quaint, striking, andwell adapted to the purpose.  It was merely one large sheet, with ablack ground, and the letters cut out in the block, so as to printwhite.  The reading was "Artemus Ward will Speak a Piece."  To theAmerican mind this was intensely funny from its childish absurdity.It is customary in the States for children to speak or recite "apiece" at school at the annual examination, and the phrase is usedjust in the same sense as in England we say "a Christmas piece."The professed subject of the lecture being that of a story familiarto children, harmonised well with the droll placard which announcedits delivery.  The place and time were notified on a slip pastedbeneath.  To emerge from the dull depths of lyceum committees andlaunch out as a showman-lecturer on his own responsibility, wassomething both novel and bold for Artemus to do.  In the majority ofinstances he or his agent met with speculators who were ready toengage him for so many lectures, and secure to the lecturer acertain fixed sum.  But in his later transactions Artemus would havenothing to do with them, much preferring to undertake all the riskhimself.  The last speculator to whom he sold himself for a tourwas, I believe, Mr. Wilder, of New York City, who realised a largeprofit by investing in lecturing stock, and who was always ready toengage a circus, a wild-beast show, or a lecturing celebrity.As a rule Artemus Ward succeeded in pleasing every one in hisaudience, especially those who understood the character of the manand the drift of his lecture; but there were not wanting at any ofhis lectures a few obtuse-minded, slowly-perceptive, drowsy-headeddullards, who had not the remotest idea what the entertainer wastalking about, nor why those around him indulged in laughter.Artemus was quick to detect these little spots upon the sunny faceof his auditory.  He would pick them out, address himself at timesto them especially, and enjoy the bewilderment of his Boeotianpatrons.  Sometimes a stolid inhabitant of central New York,evidently of Dutch extraction, would regard him with an open stareexpressive of a desire to enjoy that which was said if the point ofthe joke could by any possibility be indicated to him.  At othertimes a demure Pennsylvania Quaker would benignly survey the poorlecturer with a look of benevolent pity; and on one occasion, whenmy friend was lecturing at Peoria, an elderly lady, accompanied byher two daughters, left the room in the midst of the lecture,exclaiming, as she passed me at the door, "It is too bad of peopleto laugh at a poor young man who doesn't know what he is saying, andought to be sent to a lunatic asylum!"The newspaper reporters were invariably puzzled in attempting togive any correct idea of a lecture by Artemus Ward.  No report couldfairly convey an idea of the entertainment; and being fully aware ofthis, Artemus would instruct his agent to beg of the papers not toattempt giving any abstract of that which he said.  The following isthe way in which the reporter of the Golden Era, at San Francisco,California, endeavoured to inform the San Franciscan public of thecharacter of "The Babes in the Wood" lecture.  It is, as the readerwill perceive, a burlesque on the way in which Artemus himself dealtwith the topic he had chosen; while it also notes one or two of thesalient features of my friend's style of Lecturing:"HOW ARTEMUS WARD 'SPOKE A PIECE.'""Artemus has arrived.  Artemus has spoken.  Artemus has triumphed.Great is Artemus!"Great also is Platt's Hall.  But Artemus is greater; for the hallproved too small for his audience, and too circumscribed for theimmensity of his jokes.  A man who has drank twenty bottles of winemay be called `full.'  A pint bottle with a quart of water in itwould also be accounted full; and so would an hotel be, every bed init let three times over on the same night to three differentoccupants; but none of these would be so full as Platt's Hall was onFriday night to hear Artemus Ward `speak a piece.'"The piece selected was `The Babes in the Wood,' which reminds usthat Mr. Ward is a tall, slender-built, fair-complexioned,jovial-looking gentleman of about twenty-seven years of age.  He hasa pleasant manner, an agreeable style, and a clear, distinct, andpowerful voice."'The Babes in the Wood' is a 'comic oration,' with a mostcomprehensive grasp of subject.  As spoken by its witty author, itelicited gusto of laughter and whirlwinds of applause.  Mr. Ward isno prosy lyceum lecturer.  His style is neither scientific,didactic, or philosophical.  It is simply that of a man who isbrimful of mirth, wit, and satire, and who is compelled to let itflow forth.  Maintaining a very grave countenance himself, he playsupon the muscles of other people's faces as though they were piano-strings, and he the prince of pianists."The story of 'The Babes in the Wood' is interesting in the extreme.We would say, en passant, however, that Artemus Ward is a perfectsteam factory of puns and a museum of American humour.  Humanityseems to him to be a vast mine, out of which he digs tons of fun;and life a huge forest, in which he can cut down 'cords' ofcomicality.  Language with him is like the brass balls with whichthe juggler amuses us at the circus--ever being tossed up, everglittering, ever thrown about at pleasure.  We intended to reporthis lecture in full, but we laughed till we split our lead pencil,and our shorthand symbols were too infused with merriment to remainsteady on the paper.  However, let us proceed to give an idea of'The Babes in the Wood.'  In the first place, it is a comic oration;that is, it is spoken, is exuberant in fun, felicitous in fancy,teeming with jokes, and sparkling as bright waters on a sunny day.The 'Babes in the Wood' is--that is, it isn't a lecture or anoratorical effort; it is something sui generis; something reservedfor our day and generation, which it would never have done for ourforefathers to have known, or they would have been too mirthful tohave attended to the business of preparing the world for our coming;and something which will provoke so much laughter in our time, thatthe echo of the laughs will reverberate along the halls of futurity,and seriously affect the nerves of future generations."The 'Babes in the Wood,' to describe it, is--Well, those wholistened to it know best.  At any rate, they will acknowledge withus that it was a great success, and that Artemus Ward has a fortunebefore him in California."And now to tell the story of 'The Babes in the Wood'--But we willnot, for the hall was not half large enough to accommodate those whocame, consequently Mr. Ward will tell it over again at theMetropolitan Theatre next Tuesday evening.  The subject will againbe 'The Babes in the Wood.'"Having travelled over the Union with "The Babes in the Wood"lecture, and left his audiences everywhere fully "in the wood" asregarded the subject announced in the title, Artemus Ward becamedesirous of going over the same ground again.  There were notwanting dreary and timid prophets who told him that having "sold"his audiences once, he would not succeed in gaining large houses asecond time.  But the faith of Artemus in the unsuspecting nature ofthe public was very large, so with fearless intrepidity he conceivedthe happy thought of inventing a new title, but keeping to the sameold lecture, interspersing it here and there with a few fresh jokes,incidental to new topics of the times.  Just at this period GeneralMcClellan was advancing on Richmond, and the celebrated fight atBull's Run had become matter of history.  The forcible abolition ofslavery had obtained a place among the debates of the day, HintonRowan Helper's book on "The Inevitable Crisis" had been sold atevery bookstall, and the future of the negro had risen into theposition of being the great point of discussion throughout the land.Artemus required a very slender thread to string his jokes upon, andwhat better one could be found than that which he chose?  Headvertised the title of his next lecture as "Sixty Minutes inAfrica."  I need scarcely say that he had never been in Africa, andin all probability had never read a book on African travel.  He knewnothing about it, and that was the very reason he should chooseAfrica for his subject.  I believe that he carried out the joke sofar as to have a map made of the African continent, and that on afew occasions, but not on all, he had it suspended in thelecture-room.  It was in Philadelphia and at the Musical Fund Hallin Locust Street that I first heard him deliver what he jocularlyphrased to me as "My African Revelation."  The hall was verythronged, the audience must have exceeded two thousand in number,and the evening was unusually warm.  Artemus came on the rostrumwith a roll of paper in his hands, and used it to play withthroughout the lecture, just as recently at the Egyptian Hall, whilelecturing on the Mormons, he invariably made use of a lady's riding-whip for the same purpose.  He commenced his lecture thus, speakingvery gravely and with long pauses between his sentences, allowinghis audience to laugh if they pleased, but seeming to utterlydisregard their laughter:"I have invited you to listen to a discourse upon Africa.  Africa ismy subject.  It is a very large subject.  It has the Atlantic Oceanon its left side, the Indian Ocean on its right, and more water thanyou could measure out at its smaller end.Africa produces blacks--ivory blacks--they get ivory.  It alsoproduces deserts, and that is the reason it is so much deserted bytravellers.  Africa is famed for its roses.  It has the red rose,the white rose, and the neg-rose.  Apropos of negroes, let me tellyou a little story."Then he at once diverged from the subject of Africa to retail to hisaudience his amusing story of the Conversion of a Negro, which hesubsequently worked up into an article in the Savage Club Papers,and entitled "Converting the Nigger."  Never once again in thecourse of the lecture did he refer to Africa, until the time havingarrived for him to conclude, and the people being fairly worn outwith laughter, he finished up by saying, "Africa, ladies andgentlemen, is my subject.  You wish me to tell you something aboutAfrica.  Africa is on the map--it is on all the maps of Africa thatI have ever seen.  You may buy a good map for a dollar, and if youstudy it well, you will know more about Africa than I do.  It is acomprehensive subject, too vast, I assure you, for me to enter uponto-night.  You would not wish me to, I feel that--I feel it deeply,and I am very sensitive.  If you go home and go to bed it will bebetter for you than to go with me to Africa."The joke about the "neg-rose" has since run the gauntlet of nearlyall the minstrel bands throughout England and America.  All the"bones," every "middle-man," and all "end-men" of the burnt-corkprofession have used Artemus Ward as a mine wherein to dig for theore which provokes laughter.  He has been the "cause of wit inothers," and the bread-winner for many dozens of black-facesongsters--"singists" as he used to term them.  He was just as fondof visiting their entertainments as they were of appropriating hisjokes; and among his best friends in New York were the brothersMessrs Neil and Dan Bryant, who have made a fortune by what has beenfacetiously termed "the burnt-cork opera."It was in his "Sixty Minutes in Africa" lecture that Artemus Wardfirst introduced his celebrated satire on the negro, which hesubsequently put into print.  "The African," said he, "may be ourbrother.  Several highly respectable gentlemen and some talentedfemales tell me that he is, and for argument's sake I might beinduced to grant it, though I don't believe it myself.  But theAfrican isn't our sister, and wife, and uncle.  He isn't several ofour brothers and first wife's relations.  He isn't our grandfatherand great grandfather, and our aunt in the country.  Scarcely."It may easily be imagined how popular this joke became when it isremembered that it was first perpetrated at a time when the negroquestion was so much debated as to have become an absolute nuisance.Nothing else was talked of; nobody would talk of anything but thenegro.  The saying arose that all Americans had "nigger-onthe-brain."  The topic had become nauseous, especially to theDemocratic party; and Artemus always had more friends among themthan among the Republicans.  If he had any politics at all he wascertainly a Democrat.War had arisen, the South was closed, and the lecturing arenaconsiderably lessened.  Artemus Ward determined to go to California.Before starting for that side of the American continent, he wishedto appear in the city of New York.  He engaged, through his friendMr. De Walden, the large hall then known as Niblo's, in front of theNiblo's Garden Theatre, and now used, I believe, as the dining-roomof the Metropolitan Hotel.  At that period Pepper's Ghost chanced tobe the great novelty of New York City, and Artemus Ward was castingabout for a novel title to his old lecture.  Whether he or Mr. DeWalden selected that of "Artemus Ward's Struggle with a Ghost" I donot know; but I think that it was Mr. De Walden's choice.  The titlewas seasonable, and the lecture successful.  Then came the tour toCalifornia, whither I proceeded in advance to warn the miners on theYuba, the travellers on the Rio Sacramento, and the citizens of theChrysopolis of the Pacific that "A. Ward" would be there shortly.In California the lecture was advertised under its old name of "TheBabes in the Wood."  Platt's Hall was selected for the scene ofoperation, and, so popular was the lecturer, that on the first nightwe took at the doors more than sixteen hundred dollars in gold.  Thecrowd proved too great to take money in the ordinary manner, andhats were used for people to throw their dollars in.  One hat brokethrough at the crown.  I doubt if we ever knew to a dollar how manydollars it once contained.California was duly travelled over, and "The Babes in the Wood"listened to with laughter in its flourishing cities, itsmining-camps among the mountains, and its "new placers besidegold-bedded rivers.  While journeying through that strangely-beautiful land, the serious question arose--What was to be donenext?  After California--where?Before leaving New York, it had been a favourite scheme of ArtemusWard not to return from California to the East by way of Panama, butto come home across the Plains, and to visit Salt Lake City by theway.  The difficulty that now presented itself was, that winter wasclose upon us, and that it was no pleasant thing to cross the SierraNevada and scale the Rocky Mountains with the thermometer far belowfreezingpoint.  Nor was poor Artemus even at that time a strong man.My advice was to return to Panama, visit the West India Islands, andcome back to California in the spring, lecture again in SanFrancisco, and then go on to the land of the Mormons.  Artemusdoubted the feasibility of this plan, and the decision wasultimately arrived at to try the journey to Salt Lake.Unfortunately the winter turned out to be one of the severest.  Whenwe arrived at Salt Lake City, my poor friend was seized with typhoidfever, resulting from the fatigue we had undergone, the intense coldto which we had been subjected, and the excitement of being on ajourney of 3500 miles across the North American Continent, when thePacific Railway had made little progress and the Indians werereported not to be very friendly.The story of the trip is told in Artemus Ward's lecture.  I haveadded to it, at the special request of the publisher, a fewexplanatory notes, the purport of which is to render the readeracquainted with the characteristics of the lecturer's delivery.  Forthe benefit of those who never had an opportunity of seeing ArtemusWard nor of hearing him lecture, I may be pardoned for attempting todescribe the man himself.In stature he was tall, in figure, slender.  At any time during ouracquaintance his height must have been disproportionate to hisweight.  Like his brother Cyrus, who died a few years before him;Charles F. Browne, our "Artemus Ward," had the premonitory signs ofa short life strongly evident in his early manhood.  There were thelank form, the long pale fingers, the very white pearly teeth, thethin, fine, soft hair, the undue brightness of the eyes, theexcitable and even irritable disposition, the capricious appetite,and the alternately jubilant and despondent tone of mind which toofrequently indicate that "the abhorred fury with the shears" iswaiting too near at hand to "slit the thin-spun life."  His hair wasvery light-colored, and not naturally curly.  He used to joke in hislecture about what it cost him to keep it curled; he wore a verylarge moustache without any beard or whiskers; his nose wasexceedingly prominent, having an outline not unlike that of the lateSir Charles Napier.  His forehead was large, with, to use thelanguage of the phrenologists, the organs of the perceptivefaculties far more developed than those of the imaginative powers.He had the manner and bearing of a naturally-born gentleman.  Greatwas the disappointment of many who, having read his humorous papersdescriptive of his exhibition of snakes and waxwork, and who havingalso formed their ideas of him from the absurd pictures which hadbeen attached to some editions of his works, found on meeting withhim that there was no trace of the showman in his deportment, andlittle to call up to their mind the smart Yankee who had married"Betsy Jane."  There was nothing to indicate that he had not lived along time in Europe and acquired the polish which men gain by comingin contact with the society of European capitals.  In hisconversation there was no marked peculiarity of accent to identifyhim as an American, nor any of the braggadocio which some of hiscountrymen unadvisedly assume.  His voice was soft, gentle, andclear.  He could make himself audible in the largest lecture-roomswithout effort.  His style of lecturing was peculiar; so thoroughlysui generis, that I know of no one with whom to compare him, nor canany description very well convey an idea of that which it was like.However much he caused his audience to laugh, no smile appeared uponhis own face.  It was grave, even to solemnity, while he was givingutterance to the most delicious absurdities.  His assumption ofindifference to that which he was saying, his happy manner ofletting his best jokes fall from his lips as if unconscious of theirbeing jokes at all, his thorough self-possession on the platform,and keen appreciation of that which suited his audience and thatwhich did not, rendered him well qualified for the task which he hadundertaken--that of amusing the public with a humorous lecture.  Heunderstood and comprehended to a hair's breadth the grand secret ofhow not to bore.  He had weighed, measured, and calculated to anicety the number of laughs an audience could indulge in on oneevening, without feeling that they were laughing just a little toomuch.  Above all, he was no common man, and did not cause hisaudience to feel that they were laughing at that which they shouldfeel ashamed of being amused with.  He was intellectually up to thelevel of nine-tenths of those who listened to him, and in listening,they felt that it was no fool who wore the cap and bells soexcellently.  It was amusing to notice how with different people hisjokes produced a different effect.  The Honourable Robert Loweattended one evening at the Mormon Lecture, and laughed ashilariously as any one in the room.  The next evening Mr. JohnBright happened to be present.  With the exception of one or twooccasional smiles, he listened with grave attention.In placing the lecture before the public in print, it is impossible,by having recourse to any system of punctuation, to indicate thepauses, jerky emphases, and odd inflexions of voice whichcharacterised the delivery.  The reporter of the Standard newspaper,describing his first lecture in London, aptly said: "Artemus droppedhis jokes faster than the meteors of last night succeeded each otherin the sky.  And there was this resemblance between the flashes ofhis humour and the flights of the meteors, that in each case onelooked for jokes or meteors, but they always came just in the placethat one least expected to find them.  Half the enjoyment of theevening lay, to some of those present, in listening to the heartycachinnation of the people who only found out the jokes some two orthree minutes after they were made, and who then laughed apparentlyat some grave statements of fact.  Reduced to paper, the showman'sjokes are certainly not brilliant; almost their whole effect lies intheir seemingly impromptu character.  They are carefully led up to,of course; but they are uttered as if they are mere afterthoughts,of which the speaker is hardly sure."  Herein the writer in theStandard hits the most marked peculiarity of Artemus Ward's style oflecturing.  His affectation of not knowing what he was uttering, hisseeming fits of abstraction, and his grave, melancholy aspect,constituted the very cream of the entertainment.  Occasionally hewould amuse himself in an apparently meditative mood, by twirlinghis little riding-whip, or by gazing earnestly, but with affectedadmiration, at his panorama.  At the Egyptian Hall his healthentirely failed him, and he would occasionally have to use a seatduring the course of the lecture.  In the notes which follow I havetried, I know how inefficiently, to convey here and there an idea ofhow Artemus rendered his lecture amusing by gesture or action.  Ihave also, at the request of the publisher, made a few explanatorycomments on the subject of our Mormon trip.  In so doing I hope thatI have not thrust myself too prominently forward, nor been tooofficious in my explanations.  My aim has been to add to theinterest of the lecture with those who never heard it delivered, andto revive in the memory of those who did some of its notablepeculiarities.  The illustrations are from photographs of thepanorama painted in America for Artemus, as the pictorial portion ofhis entertainment.In the lecture is the fun of the journey.  For the hard facts thereader in quest of information is referred to a book publishedpreviously to the lecturer's appearance at the Egyptian Hall, thetitle of which is, "Artemus Ward:  His Travels among the Mormons."Much against the grain as it was for Artemus to be statistical, hehas therein detailed some of the experiences of his Mormon trip,with due regard to the exactitude and accuracy of statement expectedby information-seeking readers in a book of travels.  He was notprecisely the sort of traveller to write a paper for the eveningmeetings of the Royal Geographical Society, nor was he sufficientlyinterested in philosophical theories to speculate on thedevelopments of Mormonism as illustrative of the history ofreligious belief.  We were looking out of the window of the SaltLake House one morning, when Brigham Young happened to pass down theopposite side of Main Street.  It was cold weather, and the prophetwas clothed in a thick cloak of some green-colored material.  Iremarked to Artemus that Brigham had seemingly compounded Mormonismfrom portions of a dozen different creeds; and that in selectinggreen for the color of his apparel, he was imitating Mahomet.  "Hasit not struck you," I observed, "that Swedenborgianism andMahometanism are oddly blended in the Mormon faith?""Petticoatism and plunder," was Artemus's reply--and thatcomprehended his whole philosophy of Mormonism.  As he remarkedelsewhere:  "Brigham Young is a man of great natural ability.  If youask me, How pious is he? I treat it as a conundrum, and give it up."To lecture in London, and at the Egyptian Hall, had long been afavourite idea of Artemus Ward.  Some humorist has said, that "Allgood Americans, when they die--, go to Paris."  So do most, whethergood or bad, while they are living.Still more strongly developed is the transatlantic desire to go toRome.  In the far west of the Missouri, in the remoter west ofColorado and away in far north-western Oregon, I have heard many atradesman express his intention to make dollars enough to enable himto visit Rome.  In a land where all is so new, where they have hadno past, where an old wall would be a sensation, and a tombstone ofanybody's great grandfather the marvel of the whole region, thecharms of the old world have an irresistible fascination.  To visitthe home of the Caesars they have read of in their school-books, andto look at architecture which they have seen pictorially, but havenothing like it in existence around them, is very naturally thestrong wish of people who are nationally nomadic, and who have allmore or less a smattering of education.  Artemus Ward neverexpressed to me any very great wish to travel on the Europeancontinent, but to see London was to accomplish something which hehad dreamed of from his boyhood.  There runs from Marysville inCalifornia to Oroville in the same State a short and singular littlerailway, which, when we were there, was in a most unfinishedcondition.  To Oroville we were going.  We were too early for thetrain at the Marysville station, and sat down on a pile of timber tochat over future prospects."What sort of a man was Albert Smith?" asked Artemus "And do youthink that the Mormons would be as good a subject for the Londonersas Mont Blanc was?"I answered his questions.  He reflected for a few moments, and thensaid:"Well, old fellow, I'll tell you what I should like to do.  I shouldlike to go to London and give my lecture in the same place.  Can itbe done?"It was done.  Not in the same room, but under the same roof and onthe same floor; in that gloomy-looking Hall in Piccadilly, which wasdestined to be the ante-chamber to the tomb of both lecturers.Throughout this brief sketch I have written familiarly of the lateMr. Charles F. Browne as "Artemus Ward," or simply as "Artemus."  Ihave done so advisedly, mainly because, during the whole course ofour acquaintance, I do not remember addressing him as "Mr. Browne,"or by his real Christian name.  To me he was always "Artemus"--Artemus the kind, the gentle, the suave, the generous.  One who wasever a friend in the fullest meaning of the word, and the best ofcompanions in the amplest acceptance of the phrase.  His merry laughand pleasant conversation are as audible to me as if they were heardbut yesterday; his words of kindness linger on the ear of memory,and his tones of genial mirth live in echoes which I shall listen tofor evermore.  Two years will soon have passed away since last hespoke, and           "Silence now, enamour'd of his voice            Looks its mute music in her rugged cell."                                            E.P. HINGSTON.LONDON, October 1868.*  *  *ARTEMUS WARD.PART I.ESSAYS, SKETCHES, AND LETTERS.1.1.  ONE OF MR.

I know thay do, becawz Inever saw a man whoos didn't.Respectively yures,A. Ward.P.S.--You scratch my back & Ile scratch your back.1.2.  ON "FORTS."Every man has got a Fort.  It's sum men's fort to do one thing,and some other men's fort to do another, while there is numerisshiftliss critters goin round loose whose fort is not to donothin.Shakspeer rote good plase, but he wouldn't hav succeeded as aWashington correspondent of a New York daily paper.  He lackt therekesit fancy and imagginashun.That's so!Old George Washington's Fort was not to hev eny public man of thepresent day resemble him to eny alarmin extent.  Whare bowts canGeorge's ekal be found?  I ask, & boldly anser no whares, or enywhare else.Old man Townsin's Fort was to maik Sassyperiller.  "Goy to theworld! anuther life saived!"  (Cotashun from Townsin'sadvertisemunt.)Cyrus Field's Fort is to lay a sub-machine tellegraf under theboundin billers of the Oshun, and then hev it Bust.Spaldin's Fort is to maik Prepared Gloo, which mends everything.Wonder ef it will mend a sinner's wickid waze?  (Impromptoogoak.)Zoary's Fort is to be a femaile circus feller.My Fort is the grate moral show bizniss & ritin choice famerlyliteratoor for the noospapers.  That's what's the matter with ME.&c., &c., &c.  So I mite go on to a indefnit extent.Twict I've endeverd to do things which thay wasn't my Fort.  Thefust time was when I undertuk to lick a owdashus cuss who cut ahole in my tent & krawld threw.  Sez I, "my jentle Sir go out orI shall fall onto you putty hevy."  Sez he, "Wade in, Old waxfiggers," whareupon I went for him, but he cawt me powerful onthe hed & knockt me threw the tent into a cow pastur.  He pursoodthe attack & flung me into a mud puddle.  As I aroze & rung outmy drencht garmints I koncluded fitin wasn't my Fort.  Ile nowrize the kurtin upon Seen 2nd:  It is rarely seldum that I seekconsolation in the Flowin Bole.  But in a sertin town in Injiannyin the Faul of 18--, my orgin grinder got sick with the fever &died.  I never felt so ashamed in my life, & I thowt I'd hist ina few swallows of suthin strengthin.  Konsequents was I histid inso much I dident zackly know whare bowts I was. I turnd my livinwild beests of Pray loose into the streets and spilt all my waxwurks.  I then Bet I cood play hoss.  So I hitched myself to aKanawl bote, there bein two other hosses hitcht on also, onebehind and anuther ahead of me.  The driver hollerd for us to gitup, and we did.  But the hosses bein onused to sich a arrangemuntbegun to kick & squeal and rair up.  Konsequents was I was kicktvilently in the stummuck & back, and presuntly I fownd myself inthe Kanawl with the other hosses, kickin & yellin like a tribe ofCusscaroorus savvijis.  I was rescood, & as I was bein carrid tothe tavern on a hemlock Bored I sed in a feeble voise, "Boys,playin hoss isn't my Fort."MORUL--Never don't do nothin which isn't your Fort, for ef you doyou'll find yourself splashin round in the Kanawl, figgerativelyspeakin.1.3.  THE SHAKERS.The Shakers is the strangest religious sex I ever met.  I'd hearntell of 'em and I'd seen 'em, with their broad brim'd hats andlong wastid coats; but I'd never cum into immejit contack with'em, and I'd sot 'em down as lackin intelleck, as I'd never seen'em to my Show--leastways, if they cum they was disgised in whitepeple's close, so I didn't know 'em.But in the Spring of 18--, I got swampt in the exterior of NewYork State, one dark and stormy night, when the winds Bluepityusly, and I was forced to tie up with the Shakers.I was toilin threw the mud, when in the dim vister of the futer Iobsarved the gleams of a taller candle.  Tiein a hornet's nest tomy off hoss's tail to kinder encourage him, I soon reached theplace.  I knockt at the door, which it was opened unto me by atall, slick-faced, solum lookin individooal, who turn'd out to bea Elder."Mr. Shaker," sed I, "you see before you a Babe in the woods, soto speak, and he axes shelter of you.""Yay," sed the Shaker, and he led the way into the house, anotherShaker bein sent to put my hosses and waggin under kiver.A solum female, lookin sumwhat like a last year's beanpole stuckinto a long meal bag, cum in axed me was I athurst and did Ihunger? to which I urbanely anserd "a few."  She went orf and Iendeverd to open a conversashun with the old man."Elder, I spect?" sed I."Yay," he said."Helth's good, I reckon?""Yay.""What's the wages of a Elder, when he understans his bizness--ordo you devote your sarvices gratooitus?""Yay.""Stormy night, sir.""Yay.""If the storm continners there'll be a mess underfoot, hay?""Yay.""It's onpleasant when there's a mess underfoot?""Yay.""If I may be so bold, kind sir, what's the price of that pecoolerkind of weskit you wear, incloodin trimmins?""Yay!"I pawsd a minit, and then, thinkin I'd be faseshus with him andsee how that would go, I slapt him on the shoulder, bust into aharty larf, and told him that as a yayer he had no livin ekal.He jumpt up as if Bilin water had bin squirted into his ears,groaned, rolled his eyes up tords the sealin and sed:  "You're aman of sin!"  He then walkt out of the room.Jest then the female in the meal bag stuck her hed into the roomand statid that refreshments awaited the weary travler, and I sedif it was vittles she ment the weary travler was agreeable, and Ifollored her into the next room.I sot down to the table and the female in the meal bag pored outsum tea.  She sed nothin, and for five minutes the only livething in that room was a old wooden clock, which tickt in asubdood and bashful manner in the corner.  This dethly stillnessmade me oneasy, and I determined to talk to the female or bust.So sez I, "marrige is agin your rules, I bleeve, marm?""Yay.""The sexes liv strickly apart, I spect?""Yay.""It's kinder singler," sez I, puttin on my most sweetest look andspeakin in a winnin voice, "that so fair a made as thow never gothitched to some likely feller."  [N.B.--She was upards of 40 andhomely as a stump fence, but I thawt I'd tickil her.]"I don't like men!" she sed, very short."Wall, I dunno," sez I, "they're a rayther important part of thepopulashun.  I don't scacely see how we could git along without'em.""Us poor wimin folks would git along a grate deal better if therewas no men!""You'll excoos me, marm, but I don't think that air would work.It wouldn't be regler.""I'm fraid of men!" she sed."That's onnecessary, marm.  YOU ain't in no danger.  Don't fretyourself on that pint.""Here we're shot out from the sinful world.  Here all is peas.Here we air brothers and sisters.  We don't marry and consekentlywe hav no domestic difficulties.  Husbans don't abooze theirwives--wives don't worrit their husbans.  There's no childrenhere to worrit us.  Nothin to worrit us here.  No wickedmatrimony here.  Would thow like to be a Shaker?""No," sez I, "it ain't my stile."I had now histed in as big a load of pervishuns as I could carrycomfortable, and, leanin back in my cheer, commenst pickin myteeth with a fork.  The female went out, leavin me all alone withthe clock.  I hadn't sot thar long before the Elder poked his hedin at the door.  "You're a man of sin!" he sed, and groaned andwent away.Direckly thar cum in two young Shakeresses, as putty and slicklookin gals as I ever met.  It is troo they was drest in mealbags like the old one I'd met previsly, and their shiny, silkyhar was hid from sight by long white caps, sich as I spose femaleJosts wear; but their eyes sparkled like diminds, their cheekswas like roses, and they was charmin enuff to make a man throwstuns at his granmother if they axed him to.  They comenstclearin away the dishes, castin shy glances at me all the time.I got excited.  I forgot Betsy Jane in my rapter, and sez I, "mypretty dears, how air you?""We air well," they solumly sed."Whar's the old man?" sed I, in a soft voice."Of whom dost thow speak--Brother Uriah?""I mean the gay and festiv cuss who calls me a man of sin.Shouldn't wonder if his name was Uriah.""He has retired.""Wall, my pretty dears," sez I, "let's have sum fun.  Let's playpuss in the corner.  What say?""Air you a Shaker, sir?" they axed."Wall my pretty dears, I haven't arrayed my proud form in a longweskit yit, but if they was all like you perhaps I'd jine 'em.As it is, I'm a Shaker pro-temporary."They was full of fun.  I seed that at fust, only they was aleetle skeery. I tawt 'em Puss in the corner and sich like plase,and we had a nice time, keepin quiet of course so the old manshouldn't hear.  When we broke up, sez I, "my pretty dears, ear Igo you hav no objections, hav you, to a innersent kiss atpartin?""Yay," they said, and I YAY'D.I went up stairs to bed.  I spose I'd bin snoozin half an hourwhen I was woke up by a noise at the door.  I sot up in bed,leanin on my elbers and rubbin my eyes, and I saw the follerinpicter:  The Elder stood in the doorway, with a taller candle inhis hand.  He hadn't no wearin appeerel on except his nightclose, which flutterd in the breeze like a Seseshun flag. He sed,"You're a man of sin!" then groaned and went away.I went to sleep agin, and drempt of runnin orf with the prettylittle Shakeresses mounted on my Californy Bar.  I thawt the Barinsisted on steerin strate for my dooryard in Baldinsville andthat Betsy Jane cum out and giv us a warm recepshun with apanfull of Bilin water.  I was woke up arly by the Elder.  Hesaid refreshments was reddy for me down stairs.  Then sayin I wasa man of sin, he went groanin away.As I was goin threw the entry to the room where the vittles was,I cum across the Elder and the old female I'd met the nightbefore, and what d'ye spose they was up to?  Huggin and kissinlike young lovers in their gushingist state.  Sez I, "my Shakerfriends, I reckon you'd better suspend the rules and gitmarried.""You must excoos Brother Uriah," sed the female; "he's subjeck tofits and hain't got no command over hisself when he's into 'em.""Sartinly," sez I, "I've bin took that way myself frequent.""You're a man of sin!" sed the Elder.Arter breakfust my little Shaker frends cum in agin to clear awaythe dishes."My pretty dears," sez I, "shall we YAY agin?""Nay," they sed, and I NAY'D.The Shakers axed me to go to their meetin, as they was to havsarvices that mornin, so I put on a clean biled rag and went.The meetin house was as neat as a pin.  The floor was white aschalk and smooth as glass.  The Shakers was all on hand, in cleanweskits and meal bags, ranged on the floor like milingterycompanies, the mails on one side of the room and the females ontother.  They commenst clappin their hands and singin and dancin.They danced kinder slow at fust, but as they got warmed up theyshaved it down very brisk, I tell you.  Elder Uriah, inparticler, exhiberted a right smart chance of spryness in hislegs, considerin his time of life, and as he cum a dubble shufflenear where I sot, I rewarded him with a approvin smile and sed:"Hunky boy!  Go it, my gay and festiv cuss!""You're a man of sin!" he sed, continnerin his shuffle.The Sperret, as they called it, then moved a short fat Shaker tosay a few remarks.  He sed they was Shakers and all was ekal.They was the purest and Seleckest peple on the yearth.  Otherpeple was sinful as they could be, but Shakers was all right.Shakers was all goin kerslap to the Promist Land, and nobody wantgoin to stand at the gate to bar 'em out, if they did they'd gitrun over.The Shakers then danced and sung agin, and arter they was threw,one of 'em axed me what I thawt of it.Sez I, "What duz it siggerfy?""What?" sez he."Why this jumpin up and singin?  This long weskit bizniss, andthis anty-matrimony idee?  My frends, you air neat and tidy.Your lands is flowin with milk and honey.  Your brooms is fine,and your apple sass is honest.  When a man buys a keg of applesass of you he don't find a grate many shavins under a few layersof sass--a little Game I'm sorry to say sum of my New Englanancesters used to practiss.  Your garding seeds is fine, and if Ishould sow 'em on the rock of Gibralter probly I should raise agood mess of garding sass.  You air honest in your dealins.  Youair quiet and don't distarb nobody.  For all this I givs youcredit.  But your religion is small pertaters, I must say.  Youmope away your lives here in single retchidness, and as you airall by yourselves nothing ever conflicks with your pecooleridees, except when Human Nater busts out among you, as Iunderstan she sumtimes do.  [I giv Uriah a sly wink here, whichmade the old feller squirm like a speared Eel.]  You wear longweskits and long faces, and lead a gloomy life indeed.  Nochildren's prattle is ever hearn around your harthstuns--you airin a dreary fog all the time, and you treat the jolly sunshine oflife as tho' it was a thief, drivin it from your doors by themweskits, and meal bags, and pecooler noshuns of yourn.  The galsamong you, sum of which air as slick pieces of caliker as I eversot eyes on, air syin to place their heds agin weskits whichkiver honest, manly harts, while you old heds fool yerselves withthe idee that they air fulfillin their mishun here, and aircontented.  Here you air all pend up by yerselves, talkin aboutthe sins of a world you don't know nothin of.  Meanwhile saidworld continners to resolve round on her own axletree onct inevery 24 hours, subjeck to the Constitution of the United States,and is a very plesant place of residence.  It's a unnatral,onreasonable and dismal life you're leadin here.  So it strikesme.  My Shaker frends, I now bid you a welcome adoo.  You havtreated me exceedin well.  Thank you kindly, one and all."A base exhibiter of depraved monkeys and onprincipled waxworks!" sed Uriah."Hello, Uriah," sez I, "I'd most forgot you.

HIGH-HANDED OUTRAGE AT UTICA.In the Faul of 1856, I showed my show in Uticky, a trooly gratesitty in the State of New York.The people gave me a cordyal recepshun.  The press was loud inher prases.1 day as I was givin a descripshun of my Beests and Snaiks in myusual flowry stile what was my skorn disgust to see a big burlyfeller walk up to the cage containin my wax figgers of the Lord'sLast Supper, and cease Judas Iscarrot by the feet and drag himout on the ground.

CELEBRATION AT BALDINSVILLE IN HONOR OF THE ATLANTIC CABLE.Baldinsville, Injianny, Sep. the onct, 18&58.--I was summund homefrom Cinsinnaty quite suddin by a lettur from the Supervizers ofBaldinsville, sayin as how grate things was on the Tappis in thatair town in refferunse to sellebratin the compleshun of theSub-Mershine Tellergraph & axkin me to be Pressunt.  Lockin up myKangeroo and wax wurks in a sekure stile I took my departer forBaldinsville--"my own, my nativ lan," which I gut intwo at earlykandle litin on the follerin night & just as the sellerbrashunand illumernashun ware commensin.Baldinsville was trooly in a blaze of glory.  Near can I forgitthe surblime speckticul which met my gase as I alited from theStaige with my umbreller and verlis.  The Tarvern was lit up withtaller kandles all over & a grate bon fire was burnin in fruntthareof.  A Traspirancy was tied onto the sine post with thefollerin wurds--"Giv us Liberty or Deth."  Old Tompkinsis groserywas illumernated with 5 tin lantuns and the follerin Transpirancywas in the winder--"The Sub-Mershine Tellergraph & theBaldinsville and Stonefield Plank Road--the 2 grate eventz of the19th centerry--may intestines strife never mar their grandjure."Simpkinsis shoe shop was all ablase with kandles and lantuns.  AAmerican Eagle was painted onto a flag in a winder--also thesewurds, viz.--"The Constitooshun must be Presarved."  The Skoolhouse was lited up in grate stile and the winders was filld withmottoes amung which I notised the follerin--"Trooth smashed toerth shall rize agin--YOU CAN'T STOP HER."  "The Boy stood on theBurnin Deck whense awl but him had Fled."  "Prokrastinashun isthe theaf of Time."  "Be virtoous & you will be Happy.""Intemperunse has cawsed a heap of trubble--shun the Bole," anthe follerin sentimunt written by the skool master, who graduatedat Hudson Kollige:  "Baldinsville sends greetin to Her Magistythe Queen, & hopes all hard feelins which has heretofore previsbin felt between the Supervizers of Baldinsville and the BritishParlimunt, if such there has been, may now be forever wiped frumour Escutchuns.  Baldinsville this night rejoises over thegerlorious event which sementz 2 grate nashuns onto one anutherby means of a elecktric wire under the roarin billers of theNasty Deep.  QUOSQUE TANTRUM, A BUTTER, CATERLINY, PATENTNOSTRUM!"  Squire Smith's house was lited up regardlis ofexpense.  His little sun William Henry stood upon the roof firinorf crackers.  The old 'Squire hisself was dressed up in soljerclothes and stood on his door-step, pintin his sword sollumly toa American flag which was suspendid on top of a pole in frunt ofhis house.  Frequiently he wood take orf his cocked hat & wave itround in a impressive stile.  His oldest darter Mis IsabellerSmith, who has just cum home from the Perkinsville FemaleInstertoot, appeared at the frunt winder in the West room as thegoddis of liberty, & sung "I see them on their windin way."Booteus 1, sed I to myself, you air a angil & nothin shorter. N.Boneparte Smith, the 'Squire's oldest sun, drest hisself up asVenus the God of Wars and red the Decleration of Inderpendunsefrom the left chambir winder.  The 'Squire's wife didn't jine inthe festiverties.  She sed it was the tarnulest nonsense she everseed.  Sez she to the 'Squire, "Cum into the house and go to bedyou old fool, you.  Tomorrer you'll be goin round half-ded withthe rumertism & won't gin us a minit's peace till you get well."Sez the 'Squire, "Betsy, you little appresiate the importance ofthe event which I this night commererate."  Sez she, "Commemeratea cat's tail--cum into the house this instant, you pesky oldcritter."  "Betsy," sez the 'Squire, wavin his sword, "retire."This made her just as mad as she could stick.  She retired, butcum out agin putty quick with a panfull of Bilin hot water whichshe throwed all over the Squire, & Surs, you wood have split yoursides larfin to see the old man jump up and holler & run into thehouse.  Except this unpropishus circumstance all went as merry asa carriage bell, as Lord Byrun sez.  Doctor Hutchinsis offiss waslikewise lited up and a Transpirancy, on which was painted theQueen in the act of drinkin sum of "Hutchinsis invigorater," wasstuck into one of the winders.  The Baldinsville Bugle of Libertynoospaper offiss was also illumernated, & the follerin mottoesstuck out--"The Press is the Arkermejian leaver which moves theworld."  "Vote Early."  "Buckle on your Armer."  "Now is the timeto Subscribe."  "Franklin, Morse & Field."  "Terms 1.50 dollars ayear--liberal reducshuns to clubs."  In short the villige ofBaldinsville was in a perfect fewroar.  I never seed so manypeple thar befour in my born days.  Ile not attemp to describethe seens of that grate night.  Wurds wood fale me ef I shood tryto do it.  I shall stop here a few periods and enjoy my "Oatemcum dig the tates," as our skool master observes, in the buzzumof my famerly, & shall then resume the show biznis, which Ive bininto twenty-two (22) yeres and six (6) months.1.6.  AMONG THE SPIRITS.My naburs is mourn harf crazy on the new-fangled ideas aboutSperrets.  Sperretooul Sircles is held nitely & 4 or 5 long haredfellers has settled here and gone into the Sperret biznisexcloosively.  A atemt was made to git Mrs. A. Ward to embarkinto the Sperret biznis but the atemt faled.  1 of the long haredfellers told her she was a ethereal creeter & wood make a sweetmejium, whareupon she attact him with a mop handle & drove himout of the house.  I will hear obsarve that Mrs.Ward is ainvalerble womum--the partner of my goys & the shairer of mysorrers.  In my absunse she watchis my interests & things with aEagle Eye & when I return she welcums me in afectionate stile.Trooly it is with us as it was with Mr. & Mrs. INGOMER in thePlay, to whit,--             2 soles with but a single thawt             2 harts which beet as 1.My naburs injooced me to attend a Sperretooul Sircle at SquireSmith's.  When I arrove I found the east room chock full includinall the old maids in the villige & the long hared fellers a4sed.When I went in I was salootid with "hear cums the benited man"--"hear cums the hory-heded unbeleever"--"hear cums the skoffer attrooth," etsettery, etsettery.Sez I, "my frens, it's troo I'm hear, & now bring on yourSperrets."1 of the long hared fellers riz up and sed he would state a fewremarks.  He sed man was a critter of intelleck & was movin on toa Gole.  Sum men had bigger intellecks than other men had andthay wood git to the Gole the soonerest.  Sum men was beests &wood never git into the Gole at all.  He sed the Erth wasmateriel but man was immaterial, and hens man was different fromthe Erth.  The Erth, continnered the speaker, resolves round onits own axeltree onct in 24 hours, but as man haint gut noaxeltree he cant resolve.  He sed the ethereal essunce of thekoordinate branchis of super-human natur becum mettymorfussed asman progrest in harmonial coexistunce & eventooally antyhumanized theirselves & turned into reglar sperretuellers.  (Thiswas versifferusly applauded by the cumpany, and as I make it apint to get along as pleasant as possible, I sung out "bully foryou, old boy.")The cumpany then drew round the table and the Sircle kommenstto go it.  Thay axed me if thare was an body in the Sperret landwhich I wood like to convarse with.  I sed if Bill Tompkins, whowas onct my partner in the show biznis, was sober, I should liketo convarse with him a few periods."Is the Sperret of William Tompkins present?" sed 1 of the longhared chaps, and there was three knox on the table.Sez I, "William, how goze it, Old Sweetness?""Pretty ruff, old hoss," he replide.That was a pleasant way we had of addressin each other when hewas in the flesh."Air you in the show bizniz, William?" sed I.He sed he was.  He sed he & John Bunyan was travelin with aside show in connection with Shakspere, Jonson & Co.'s Circus.He sed old Bun (meanin Mr. Bunyan,) stired up the animils &ground the organ while he tended door. Occashunally Mr. Bunyansung a comic song.  The Circus was doin middlin well.  BillShakspeer had made a grate hit with old Bob Ridley, and BenJonson was delitin the peple with his trooly grate ax ofhossmanship without saddul or bridal.  Thay was rehersinDixey's Land & expected it would knock the peple.Sez I, "William, my luvly friend, can you pay me that 13dollars you owe me?"  He sed no with one of the most tremenjisknox I ever experiunsed.The Sircle sed he had gone.  "Air you gone, William?" I axed."Rayther," he replide, and I knowd it was no use to pursoo thesubjeck furder.I then called fur my farther."How's things, daddy?""Middlin, my son, middlin.""Ain't you proud of your orfurn boy?""Scacely.""Why not, my parient?""Becawz you hav gone to writin for the noospapers, my son.Bimeby you'll lose all your character for trooth andverrasserty.  When I helpt you into the show biznis I told youto dignerfy that there profeshun.  Litteratoor is low."He also statid that he was doin middlin well in the peanutbiznis & liked it putty well, tho' the climit was rather warm.When the Sircle stopt thay axed me what I thawt of it.Sez I, "My frends I've bin into the show biznis now goin on 23years.  Theres a artikil in the Constitooshun of the UnitedStates which sez in effeck that everybody may think just as hedarn pleazes, & them is my sentiments to a hare.  You dowtlisbeleeve this Sperret doctrin while I think it is a little mixt.Just so soon as a man becums a reglar out & out Sperret rapperhe leeves orf workin, lets his hare grow all over his fase &commensis spungin his livin out of other peple.  He eats allthe dickshunaries he can find & goze round chock full of bigwords, scarein the wimmin folks & little children & destroyinthe piece of mind of evry famerlee he enters.  He don't donobody no good & is a cuss to society & a pirit on honestpeple's corn beef barrils.  Admittin all you say abowt thedoctrin to be troo, I must say the reglar perfessional Sperritrappers--them as makes a biznis on it--air abowt the mostornery set of cusses I ever enkountered in my life.  So sayin Iput on my surtoot and went home.                              Respectably Yures,                                          Artemus Ward.1.7.  ON THE WING.Gents of the Editorial Corpse.--Since I last rit you I've met with immense success a showin myshow in varis places, particly at Detroit.  I put up at Mr.Russel's tavern, a very good tavern too, but I am sorry toinform you that the clerks tried to cum a Gouge Game on me.  Ibrandished my new sixteen dollar huntin-cased watch roundconsiderable, & as I was drest in my store clothes & had a lotof sweet-scented wagon-grease on my hair, I am free to confessthat I thought I lookt putty gay.  It never once struck me thatI lookt green.  But up steps a clerk & axes me hadn't I betterput my watch in the Safe.  "Sir," sez I, "that watch costsixteen dollars!  Yes, Sir, every dollar of it!  You can't cumit over me, my boy!  Not at all, Sir."  I know'd what the clerkwanted.  He wanted that watch himself.  He wanted to makebelieve as tho he lockt it up in the safe, then he would setthe house a fire and pretend as tho the watch was destroyedwith the other property!  But he caught a Tomarter when he gothold of me.  From Detroit I go West'ard hoe. On the cars was ahe-lookin female, with a green-cotton umbreller in one hand anda handful of Reform tracks in the other.  She sed every womanshould have a Spear.  Them as didn't demand their Spears,didn't know what was good for them.  "What is my Spear?" sheaxed, addressing the people in the cars.  "Is it to stay athome & darn stockins & be the ser-LAVE of a domineerin man?  Oris it my Spear to vote & speak & show myself the ekal of a man?Is there a sister in these keers that has her proper Spear?"Sayin which the eccentric female whirled her umbreller roundseveral times, & finally jabbed me in the weskit with it."I hav no objecshuns to your goin into the Spear bizness," sezI, "but you'll please remember I ain't a pickeril.  Don't Spearme agin, if you please."  She sot down.At Ann Arbor, bein seized with a sudden faintness, I called fora drop of suthin to drink.  As I was stirrin the beverage up, apale-faced man in gold spectacles laid his hand upon myshoulder, & sed, "Look not upon the wine when it is red!"Sez I, "This ain't wine.  This is Old Rye.""'It stingeth like a Adder and biteth like a Sarpent!'" sed theman."I guess not," sed I, "when you put sugar into it.  That's theway I allers take mine.""Have you sons grown up, sir?" the man axed."Wall," I replide, as I put myself outside my beverage, "my sonArtemus junior is goin on 18.""Ain't you afraid if you set this example be4 him he'll cum toa bad end?""He's cum to a waxed end already.  He's learnin the shoe makinbizness," I replide.  "I guess we can both on us git alongwithout your assistance, Sir," I obsarved, as he was about toopen his mouth agin."This is a cold world!" sed the man."That's so.  But you'll get into a warmer one by and by if youdon't mind your own bizness better."  I was a little riled atthe feller, because I never take anythin only when I'm onwell.I arterwards learned he was a temperance lecturer, and if hecan injuce men to stop settin their inards on fire with thefrightful licker which is retailed round the country, I shallhartily rejoice.  Better give men Prusick Assid to onct, thanto pizen 'em to deth by degrees.At Albion I met with overwhelmin success.  The celebratedAlbion Female Semenary is located here, & there air over 300young ladies in the Institushun, pretty enough to eat withoutseasonin or sass.  The young ladies was very kind to me,volunteerin to pin my handbills onto the backs of theirdresses.  It was a surblime site to see over 300 young ladiesgoin round with a advertisement of A. Ward's onparaleld show,conspickusly posted onto their dresses.They've got a Panick up this way and refooze to take Westernmoney.  It never was worth much, and when western men, whoknows what it is, refooze to take their own money it is abouttime other folks stopt handlin it.  Banks are bustin every day,goin up higher nor any balloon of which we hav any record.These western bankers air a sweet & luvly set of men.  I wish Iowned as good a house as some of 'em would break into!Virtoo is its own reward.                                                   A. Ward.1.8.  THE OCTOROON.It is with no ordernary feelins of Shagrin & indignashun that Irite you these here lines.  Sum of the hiest and most purestfeelins whitch actoate the humin hart has bin trampt onto.  TheAmerycan flag has bin outrajed.  Ive bin nussin a Adder in myBoozum.  The fax in the kase is these here:A few weeks ago I left Baldinsville to go to N.Y. fur to gitout my flamin yeller hanbills fur the Summer kampane, & as Iwas peroosin a noospaper on the kars a middel aged man inspeckterkuls kum & sot down beside onto me.  He was drest inblack close & was appeerently as fine a man as ever was."A fine day, Sir," he did unto me strateway say."Middlin," sez I, not wishin to kommit myself, tho he peered tobe as fine a man as there was in the wurld--"It is a middlinfine day, Square," I obsarved.Sez he, "How fares the Ship of State in yure regine ofcountry?"Sez I, "We don't hav no ships in our State--the kanawl is ourbest holt."He pawsed a minit and then sed, "Air yu aware, Sir, that thekrisis is with us?""No," sez I, getting up and lookin under the seet, "whare isshe?""It's hear--it's everywhares," he sed.Sez I, "Why how you tawk!" and I gut up agin & lookt all round."I must say, my fren," I continnered, as I resoomed my seet,"that I kan't see nothin of no krisis myself."  I felt sumwhatalarmed, & arose & in a stentoewrian voice obsarved that if anylady or gentleman in that there kar had a krisis consealedabowt their persons they'd better projuce it to onct or sufferthe konsequences.  Several individoouls snickered rite out,while a putty little damsell rite behind me in a pinc gown madethe observashun, "He, he.""Sit down, my fren," sed the man in black close, "yumiskomprehend me.  I meen that the perlittercal ellermunts areorecast with black klouds, 4boden a friteful storm.""Wall," replide I, "in regard to perlittercal ellerfunts Idon't know as how but what they is as good as enny other kindof ellerfunts.  But I maik bold to say thay is all a ornery set& unpleasant to hav around.  They air powerful hevy eaters &take up a right smart chans of room, & besides thay air as uglyand revenjeful, as a Cusscaroarus Injun, with 13 inches of cornwhisky in his stummick."  The man in black close seemed to beas fine a man as ever was in the wurld.  He smilt & sed praps Iwas rite, tho it was ellermunts instid of ellerfunts that hewas alludin to, & axed me what was my prinserpuls?"I haint gut enny," sed I--"not a prinserpul.  Ime in the showbiznis."  The man in black close, I will hear obsarve, seemedto be as fine a man as ever was in the wurld."But," sez he, "you hav feelins into you?  You cimpathize withthe misfortunit, the loly & the hart-sick, don't you?"  He bustinto teers and axed me ef I saw that yung lady in the seet outyender, pintin to as slick a lookin gal as I ever seed.Sed I, "2 be shure I see her--is she mutch sick?"  The man inblack close was appeerently as fine a man as ever was in thewurld ennywhares."Draw closter to me," sed the man in black close.  "Let me gitmy mowth fernenst yure ear.  Hush--SHESE A OCTOROON!""No!" sez I, gittin up in a exsited manner, "yu don't say so!How long has she bin in that way?""Frum her arliest infuncy," sed he."Wall, whot upon arth duz she doo it fur?" I inquired."She kan't help it," sed the man in black close.  "It's thebrand of Kane.""Wall, she'd better stop drinkin Kane's brandy," I replide."I sed the brand of Kane was upon her--not brandy, my fren.Yure very obtoose."I was konsiderbul riled at this.  Sez I, "My gentle Sir, Ime anonresistanter as a ginral thing, & don't want to git up norows with nobuddy, but I kin nevertheles kave in enny man's hedthat calls me a obtoos," with whitch remarks I kommenst fur topull orf my extry garmints. "Cum on," sez I--"Time! hear's theBeniki Boy fur ye!" & I darnced round like a poppit.  He riz upin his seet & axed my pardin--sed it was all a mistake--that Iwas a good man, etsettery, & sow 4th, & we fixt it all uppleasant.  I must say the man in black close seamed to be asfine a man as ever lived in the wurld.  He sed a Octoroon wasthe 8th of a negrow.  He likewise statid that the female he wastravlin with was formurly a slave in Mississippy; that she'dpurchist her freedim & now wantid to purchiss the freedim ofher poor old muther, who (the man in black close obsarved) wasbetween 87 years of age & had to do all the cookin & washin for25 hired men, whitch it was rapidly breakin down her konstitushun.He sed he knowed the minit he gazed onto my klassic & beneverluntfase that I'd donate librully & axed me to go over & see her,which I accordingly did.  I sot down beside her and sed, "yureSarvant, Marm!  How do yer git along?"She bust in 2 teers & sed, "O Sur, I'm so retchid--I'm a poorunfortunit Octoroon.""So I larn.  Yure rather more Roon than Octo, I take it," sedI, fur I never seed a puttier gal in the hull endoorin time ofmy life.  She had on a More Antic Barsk & a Poplin Nubier withBerage trimmins onto it, while her ise & kurls was enuff tomake a man jump into a mill pond without biddin his relashunsgood-by.  I pittid the Octoroon from the inmost recusses of myhart & hawled out 50 dollars kerslap, & told her to buy her oldmuther as soon as posserbul.  Sez she "kine sir mutch thanks."She then lade her hed over onto my showlder & sed I was "oldrats."  I was astonished to heer this obsarvation, which Iknowd was never used in refined society & I perlitely butemfattercly shovd her hed away.Sez I "Marm, I'm trooly sirprized."Sez she, "git out.  Yure the nicist old man Ive seen yit.  Giveus anuther 50!"  Had a seleck assortment of the most tremenjiousthunderbolts descended down onto me I couldn't hav bin moretakin aback.  I jumpt up, but she ceased my coat tales & in awild voise cride, "No, Ile never desart you--let us fli togetherto a furrin shoor!"Sez I, "not mutch we wont," and I made a powerful effort to getawa from her.  "This is plade out," I sed, whereupon she jerktme back into the seet.  "Leggo my coat, you scandaluss female,"I roared, when she set up the most unarthly yellin and hollerinyou ever heerd.  The passinjers & the gentlemunly konducterrusht to the spot, & I don't think I ever experiunsed sich arumpus in the hull coarse of my natral dase.  The man in blackclose rusht up to me & sed "How dair yu insult my neece, youhorey heded vagabone.  You base exhibbiter of low wax figgers--yu woolf in sheep's close," & sow 4th.I was konfoozed.  I was a loonytick fur the time bein, andoffered 5 dollars reward to enny gentleman of good morrulcarracter who wood tell me whot my name was & what town I livdinto.  The konducter kum to me & sed the insultid parties woodsettle for 50 dollars, which I immejitly hawled out, & aganeimplored sumbuddy to state whare I was prinsipully, & if Ishood be thare a grate while my self ef things went on asthey'd bin goin fur sum time back.  I then axed if there wasenny more Octoroons present, "becawz," sez I, "ef there is, letum cum along, fur Ime in the Octoroon bizniss."  I then threwmy specterculs out of the winder, smasht my hat wildly downover my Ise, larfed highsterically & fell under a seet.  I laythere sum time & fell asleep.  I dreamt Mrs. Ward & the twinshad bin carried orf by Ryenosserhosses & that Baldinsville hadbin captered by a army of Octoroons.  When I awoked the lampswas a burnin dimly.  Sum of the passinjers was a snorein likepawpusses & the little damsell in the pinc gown was a singin"Oft in the Silly nite."  The onprinsipuld Octoroon & themiserbul man in black close was gone, & all of a suddent itflasht ore my brane that I'de bin swindild.1.9.  EXPERIENCE AS AN EDITOR.In the Ortum of 18-- my frend, the editor of the BaldinsvilleBugle, was obleged to leave perfeshernal dooties & go & dig histaters, & he axed me to edit for him dooring his absence.Accordingly I ground up his Shears and commenced.  It didn'ttake me a grate while to slash out copy enuff from the xchanges(Perhaps five per cent. of the Western newspapers is originalmatter relating to the immediate neighborhood, the rest iscomposed of "telegraphs" and clippings from the "exchanges"--ageneral term applied to those papers posted in exchange forothers, the accommodation being a mutual benefit.) for oneissoo, and I thawt I'd ride up to the next town on a littleJaunt, to rest my Branes, which had bin severely rackt by mymental efforts.  (This is sorter Ironical.)  So I went over tothe Rale Road offiss and axed the Sooprintendent for a pars."YOU a editer?" he axed, evijently on the pint of snickerin."Yes Sir," sez I; "don't I look poor enuff?""Just about," sed he, "but our Road can't pars you.""Can't, hay?""No Sir--it can't.""Becauz," sez I, lookin him full in the face with a Eagle eye,"IT GOES SO DARNED SLOW IT CAN'T PARS ANYBODY!"  Methinks I hadhim thar.  It's the slowest Rale Road in the West.  With amortified air, he told me to git out of his offiss.  I pittidhim and went.1.10.  OBERLIN.About two years ago I arrove in Oberlin, Ohio.  Oberlin iswhare the celebrated college is.  In fack, Oberlin IS thecollege, everything else in that air vicinity resolvin aroundexcloosivly for the benefit of that institution.  It is a verygood college, too, & a grate many wurthy yung men go thereannooally to git intelleck into 'em.  But its my onbiassed'pinion that they go it rather too strong on Ethiopians atOberlin.  But that's nun of my bisniss.  I'm into the Showbizness.  Yit as a faithful historan I must menshun the fackthat on rainy dase white peple can't find their way threw thestreets without the gas is lit, there bein such a numerosity ofcullerd pussons in the town.As I was sayin, I arroved at Oberlin, and called on PerfesserPeck for the purpuss of skewerin Kolonial Hall to exhibit mywax works and beests of Pray into.  Kolonial Hall is in thecollege and is used by the stujents to speak peaces and readessays into.Sez Perfesser Peck, "Mister Ward, I don't know 'bout thisbizniss.  What are your sentiments?"Sez I, "I hain't got any.""Good God!" cried the Perfesser, "did I understan you to sayyou hav no sentiments!""Nary a sentiment!" sez I."Mister Ward, don't your blud bile at the thawt that threemillion and a half of your culled brethren air a clankin theirchains in the South?"Sez I, "Not a bile!  Let 'em clank!"He was about to continner his flowry speech when I put astopper on him.  Sez I, "Perfesser Peck, A. Ward is my name &Americky is my nashun; I'm allers the same, tho' humble is mystation, and I've bin in the show bizniss goin on 22 years.The pint is, can I hav your Hall by payin a fair price?  Youair full of sentiments.  That's your lay, while I'm a exhibiterof startlin curiosities.  What d'ye say?""Mister Ward, you air endowed with a hily practical mind, andwhile I deeply regret that you air devoid of sentiments I'lllet you hav the hall provided your exhibition is of a moral &elevatin nater."Sez I, "Tain't nothin shorter."So I opened in Kolonial Hall, which was crowded every nite withstujents, &c.  Perfesser Finny gazed for hours at my Kangaroo,but when that sagashus but onprincipled little cuss set up oneof his onarthly yellins and I proceeded to hosswhip him, thePerfesser objected.  "Suffer not your angry pashums to rise upat the poor annimil's little excentrissities," said thePerfesser."Do you call such conduck as THOSE a little excentrissity?" Iaxed."I do," sed he; sayin which he walked up to the cage and sezhe, "let's try moral swashun upon the poor creeter."  So he puthis hand upon the Kangeroo's hed and sed, "poor little fellow--poor little fellow--your master is very crooil, isn't he, myuntootered frend," when the Kangaroo, with a terrific yell,grabd the Perfesser by the hand and cum very near chawin itorf.  It was amoozin to see the Perfesser jump up and screamwith pane.  Sez I, "that's one of the poor little fellow'sexcentrissities!"Sez he, "Mister Ward, that's a dangerous quadruped.  He'stotally depraved. I will retire and do my lasserated hand up ina rag, and meanwhile I request you to meat out summery andsevere punishment to the vishus beest," I hosswhipt the littlecuss for upwards of 15 minutes.  Guess I licked sum of hisexcentrissity out of him.Oberlin is a grate plase.  The College opens with a prayer andthen the New York Tribune is read.  A kolleckshun is then takenup to buy overkoats with red horn buttons onto them for theindignant cullured people of Kanady.  I have to contribitlibrally two the glowrius work, as they kawl it hear.  I'mkompelled by the Fackulty to reserve front seets in my show forthe cullered peple.  At the Boardin House the cullered peplesit at the first table.  What they leeve is maid into hash forthe white peple.  As I don't like the idee of eatin my vittleswith Ethiopians, I sit at the seckind table, and thekonsequence is I've devowered so much hash that my inards is ina hily mixt up condishun.  Fish bones hav maid their appearanceall over my boddy and pertater peelins air a springin upthrough my hair.  Howsever I don't mind it.  I'm gittin alongwell in a pecunery pint of view.  The College has konfired uponme the honery title of T.K., of which I'm suffishuntly prowd.1.11.  THE SHOWMAN'S COURTSHIP.Thare was many affectin ties which made me hanker arter BetsyJane.  Her father's farm jined our'n; their cows and our'nsquencht their thurst at the same spring; our old mares bothhad stars in their forreds; the measles broke out in bothfamerlies at nearly the same period; our parients (Betsy's andmine) slept reglarly every Sunday in the same meetin house, andthe nabers used to obsarve, "How thick the Wards and Peasleysair!"  It was a surblime site, in the Spring of the year, tosee our sevral mothers (Betsy's and mine) with their gownspin'd up so thay couldn't sile 'em, affecshuntly Bilin sopetogether & aboozin the nabers.Altho I hankerd intensly arter the objeck of my affecshuns, Idarsunt tell her of the fires which was rajin in my manlyBuzzum.  I'd try to do it but my tung would kerwollup up aginthe roof of my mowth & stick thar, like deth to a deseastAfrikan or a country postmaster to his offiss, while my hartwhanged agin my ribs like a old fashioned wheat Flale agin abarn floor.'Twas a carm still nite in Joon.  All nater was husht and narya zeffer disturbed the sereen silens.  I sot with Betsy Jane onthe fense of her farther's pastur.  We'd bin rompin threw thewoods, kullin flours & drivin the woodchuck from his Nativ Lair(so to speak) with long sticks.  Wall, we sot thar on thefense, a swingin our feet two and fro, blushin as red as theBaldinsville skool house when it was fust painted, and lookinvery simple, I make no doubt.  My left arm was ockepied inballunsin myself on the fense, while my rite was woundidluvinly round her waste.I cleared my throat and tremblin sed, "Betsy, you're aGazelle."I thought that air was putty fine.  I waitid to see what effeckit would hav upon her.  It evidently didn't fetch her, for sheup and sed,"You're a sheep!"Sez I, "Betsy, I think very muchly of you.""I don't b'leeve a word you say--so there now cum!" with whichobsarvashun she hitched away from me."I wish thar was winders to my Sole," sed I, "so that you couldsee some of my feelins.  There's fire enuff in here," sed I,strikin my buzzum with my fist, "to bile all the corn beef andturnips in the naberhood.  Versoovius and the Critter ain't acircumstans!"She bowd her hed down and commenst chawin the strings to hersun bonnet."Ar could you know the sleeplis nites I worry threw with onyour account, how vittles has seized to be attractiv to me &how my lims has shrunk up, you wouldn't dowt me.  Gase on thiswastin form and these 'ere sunken cheeks"--I should have continnered on in this strane probly for sumtime, but unfortnitly I lost my ballunse and fell over into thepastur ker smash, tearin my close and seveerly damagin myselfginerally.Betsy Jane sprung to my assistance in dubble quick time anddragged me 4th.  Then drawin herself up to her full hite shesed:"I won't listen to your noncents no longer.  Jes say ritestrate out what you're drivin at.  If you mean gettin hitched,I'M IN!"I considered that air enuff for all practicul purpusses, and weproceeded immejitely to the parson's, & was made 1 that verynite.(Notiss to the Printer:  Put some stars here.)        *        *        *        *        *        *I've parst threw many tryin ordeels sins then, but Betsy Janehas bin troo as steel.  By attendin strickly to bizniss I'veamarsed a handsum Pittance. No man on this footstool can rise &git up & say I ever knowinly injered no man or wimmin folks,while all agree that my Show is ekalled by few and exceld bynone, embracin as it does a wonderful colleckshun of livin wildBeests of Pray, snaix in grate profushun, a endliss variety oflife-size wax figgers, & the only traned kangaroo in Ameriky--the most amoozin little cuss ever introjuced to a discriminatinpublic.1.12.  THE CRISIS.[This Oration was delivered before the commencement of thewar.]On returnin to my humsted in Baldinsville, Injianny, resuntly,my feller sitterzens extended a invite for me to norate to 'emon the Krysis.  I excepted & on larst Toosday nite I peared be4a C of upturned faces in the Red Skool House.  I spoke nearlyas follers:Baldinsvillins:  Hearto4, as I hav numerously obsarved, I haveabstrained from having any sentimunts or principles, mypollertics, like my religion, bein of a exceedin accommodatincharacter.  But the fack can't be no longer disgised that aKrysis is onto us, & I feel it's my dooty to accept your invitefor one consecutive nite only.  I spose the inflammertoryindividooals who assisted in projucing this Krysis know whatgood she will do, but I ain't 'shamed to state that I don'tscacely.  But the Krysis is hear.  She's bin hear for sevralweeks, & Goodness nose how long she'll stay.  But I venter toassert that she's rippin things.  She's knockt trade into acockt up hat and chaned Bizness of all kinds tighter nor I everchaned any of my livin wild Beests.  Alow me to hear dygress &stait that my Beests at presnt is as harmless as the newbornBabe.  Ladys & gentlemen needn't hav no fears on that pint.  Toresoom--Altho I can't exactly see what good this Krysis can do,I can very quick say what the origernal cawz of her is.  Theorigernal cawz is Our Afrikan Brother.  I was into BARNIM'SMoozeum down to New York the other day & saw that exsentricEtheopian, the What Is It.  Sez I, "Mister What Is It, youfolks air raisin thunder with this grate country.  You'regettin to be ruther more numeris than interestin.  It is a pityyou coodent go orf sumwhares by yourselves, & be a nation ofWhat Is Its, tho' if you'll excoose me, I shooden't care aboutmarryin among you.  No dowt you're exceedin charmin to hum, butyour stile of luvliness isn't adapted to this cold climit.  Helarfed into my face, which rather Riled me, as I had beenperfeckly virtoous and respectable in my observashuns.  So sezI, turnin a leetle red in the face, I spect, "Do you hav theunblushin impoodents to say you folks haven't raised a big messof thunder in this brite land, Mister What Is It?"  He larfedagin, wusser nor be4, whareupon I up and sez, "Go home, Sir, toAfriky's burnin shores & taik all the other What Is Its alongwith you.  Don't think we can spair your interestin picters.You What Is Its air on the pint of smashin up the gratestGuv'ment ever erected by man, & you actooally hav the owdassityto larf about it.  Go home, you low cuss!"I was workt up to a high pitch, & I proceeded to a Restorator &cooled orf with some little fishes biled in ile--I b'leeve thaycall 'em sardeens.Feller Sitterzuns, the Afrikan may be Our Brother.  Sevral hilyrespectyble gentlemen, and sum talentid females tell us so, &fur argyment's sake I mite be injooced to grant it, tho' Idon't beleeve it myself.  But the Afrikan isn't our sister &our wife & our uncle.  He isn't sevral of our brothers & allour fust wife's relashuns.  He isn't our grandfather, and ourgrate grandfather, and our Aunt in the country.  Scacely.  &yit numeris persons would have us think so.  It's troo he runsCongress & sevral other public grosserys, but then he ain'teverybody & everybody else likewise.  [Notiss to bizness men ofVANITY FAIR:  Extry charg fur this larst remark.  It's a goak.--A.W.]But we've got the Afrikan, or ruther he's got us, & now whatair we going to do about it?  He's a orful noosanse.  Praps heisn't to blame fur it.  Praps he was creatid fur sum wisepurpuss, like the measles and New Englan Rum, but it's mityhard to see it.  At any rate he's no good here, & as I statidto Mister What Is It, it's a pity he cooden't go orf sumwharesquietly by hisself, whare he cood wear red weskits & speckledneckties, & gratterfy his ambishun in varis interestin wase,without havin a eternal fuss kickt up about him.Praps I'm bearin down too hard upon Cuffy.  Cum to think on it,I am.  He woodn't be sich a infernal noosanse if white peplewould let him alone.  He mite indeed be interestin.  And now Ithink of it, why can't the white peple let him alone.  What'sthe good of continnerly stirrin him up with a ten-foot pole?He isn't the sweetest kind of Perfoomery when in a natralstait.Feller Sitterzens, the Union's in danger.  The black devilDisunion is trooly here, starein us all squarely in the face!We must drive him back.  Shall we make a 2nd Mexico ofourselves?  Shall we sell our birthrite for a mess of potash?Shall one brother put the knife to the throat of anutherbrother?  Shall we mix our whisky with each other's blud?Shall the star spangled Banner be cut up into dishcloths?Standin here in this here Skoolhouse, upon my nativ shor so tospeak, I anser--Nary!Oh you fellers who air raisin this row, & who in the fust placestartid it, I'm 'shamed of you.  The Showman blushes for you,from his boots to the topmost hair upon his wenerable hed.Feller Sitterzens:  I am in the Sheer & Yeller leaf.  I shallpeg out 1 of these dase.  But while I do stop here I shall stayin the Union.  I know not what the supervizers of Baldinsvillemay conclude to do, but for one, I shall stand by the Stars &Stripes.  Under no circumstances whatsomever will I sesesh.Let every Stait in the Union sesesh & let Palmetter flags flotethicker nor shirts on Square Baxter's close line, still will Istick to the good old flag.  The country may go to the devil,but I won't!  And next Summer when I start out on my campanewith my Show, wharever I pitch my little tent, you shall seefloatin prowdly from the center pole thereof the Amerikan Flag,with nary a star wiped out, nary a stripe less, but the sameold flag that has allers flotid thar! & the price of admishunwill be the same it allers was--15 cents, children half price.Feller Sitterzens, I am dun.  Accordinly I squatted.1.13.  WAX FIGURES VS. SHAKESPEARE.ONTO THE WING--1859.Mr. Editor.I take my Pen in hand to inform yu that I'm in good helth andtrust these few lines will find yu injoyin the same blessins.I wood also state that I'm now on the summir kampane.  As thePoit sez--               ime erflote, ime erflote               On the Swift rollin tied                An the Rovir is free.Bizness is scacely middlin, but Sirs I manige to pay for myfoode and raiment puncktooally and without no grumblin.  Thebarked arrers of slandur has bin leviled at the undersinedmoren onct sins heze bin into the show bizness, but I make boldto say no man on this footstule kan troothfully say I everronged him or eny of his folks.  I'm travelin with a tent,which is better nor hirin hauls.  My show konsists of a seriousof wax works, snakes, a paneramy kalled a Grand Movin Diarea ofthe War in the Crymear, komic songs and the Cangeroo, whichlarst little cuss continners to konduct hisself in the mostoutrajus stile.  I started out with the idear of makin my showa grate Moral Entertainment, but I'm kompeled to sware so muchat that air infurnal Kangeroo that I'm frade this desine willbe flustratid to some extent.  And while speakin of morrality,remines me that sum folks turn up their nosis at shows likemine, sayin they is low and not fit to be patrernized bypeplpeple of high degree.  Sirs, I manetane that this isinfernul nonsense.  I manetane that wax figgers is moreelevatin than awl the plays ever wroten.  Take Shakespeer forinstunse.  Peple think heze grate things, but I kontend hezequite the reverse to the kontrary.  What sort of sense is thareto King Leer, who goze round cussin his darters, chawin hay andthroin straw at folks, and larfin like a silly old koot andmakin a ass of hisself ginerally?  Thare's Mrs. Mackbeth--shezea nise kind of woomon to have round ain't she, a puttin oldMack, her husband, up to slayin Dunkan with a cheeze knife,while heze payin a frendly visit to their house.  O its hilymorral, I spoze, when she larfs wildly and sez, "gin me thedaggurs--Ile let his bowels out," or wurds to that effeck--Isay, this is awl, strickly, propper I spoze?  That JackFawlstarf is likewise a immoral old cuss, take him how ye may,and Hamlick is as crazy as a loon.  Thare's Richurd the Three,peple think heze grate things, but I look upon him in the liteof a monkster.  He kills everybody he takes a noshun to in koldblud, and then goze to sleep in his tent.  Bimeby he wakes upand yells for a hoss so he kan go orf and kill some more peple.If he isent a fit spesserman for the gallers then I shood liketo know whare you find um.  Thare's Iargo who is more ornerynor pizun.  See how shameful he treated that hily respecterbleinjun gentlemun, Mister Otheller, makin him for to beleeve hiswife was too thick with Casheo.  Obsarve how Iargo got Casheodrunk as a biled owl on corn whiskey in order to karry out hissneekin desines.  See how he wurks Mister Otheller's feelins upso that he goze and makes poor Desdemony swaller a piller whichcawses her deth.  But I must stop.  At sum futur time I shallcontinner my remarks on the drammer in which I shall show thevarst supeeriority of wax figgers and snakes over theaterplays, in a interlectooal pint of view.Very Respectively yures,                                            A WARD, T.K.1.14.  AMONG THE FREE LOVERS.  (Some queer people, callingthemselves "Free Lovers," and possessing very original ideasabout life and morality, established themselves at BerlinHeights, in Ohio, a few years since.  Public opinion wasresistlessly against them, however, and the association wassoon disbanded.)Some years ago I pitched my tent and onfurled my banner to thebreeze, in Berlin Hites, Ohio.  I had hearn that Berlin Hiteswas ockepied by a extensive seck called Free Lovers, whobeleeved in affinertys and sich, goin back on their domesticties without no hesitation whatsomever.  They was likewisespirit rappers and high presher reformers on gineralprinciples.  If I can improve these 'ere misgided peple byshowin them my onparalleld show at the usual low price ofadmitants, methunk, I shell not hav lived in vane.  Butbitterly did I cuss the day I ever sot foot in the retchidplace.  I sot up my tent in a field near the Love Cure, as theycalled it, and bimeby the free lovers begun for to congregatearound the door.  A onreer set I have never sawn.  The men'sfaces was all covered with hare and they lookt half-starved todeth.  They didn't wear no weskuts for the purpose (as theysed) of allowin the free air of hevun to blow onto theirboozums.  Their pockets was filled with tracks and pamplits andthey was bare-footed.  They sed the Postles didn't wear boots,& why should they?  That was their stile of argyment.  Thewimin was wuss than the men.  They wore trowsis, short gownds,straw hats with green ribbins, and all carried bloo cottonumbrellers.Presently a perfeckly orful lookin female presented herself atthe door.  Her gownd was skanderlusly short and her trowsis wasshameful to behold.She eyed me over very sharp, and then startin back she sed, ina wild voice:"Ah, can it be?""Which?" sed I."Yes, 'tis troo, O 'tis troo!""15 cents, marm," I anserd.She bust out a cryin & sed:"And so I hav found you at larst--at larst, O at larst!""Yes," I anserd, "you hav found me at larst, and you would havfound me at fust, if you had cum sooner."She grabd me vilently by the coat collar, and brandishin herumbreller wildly round, exclaimed:"Air you a man?"Sez I, "I think I air, but if you doubt it, you can addressMrs. A. Ward, Baldinsville, Injianny, postage pade, & she willprobly giv you the desired informashun.""Then thou ist what the cold world calls marrid?""Madam, I istest!"The exsentric female then clutched me franticly by the arm andhollered:"You air mine, O you air mine!""Scacely," I sed, endeverin to git loose from her.  But sheclung to me and sed:"You air my Affinerty!""What upon arth is that?" I shouted."Dost thou not know?""No, I dostent!""Listin man, & I'll tell ye!" sed the strange female; "foryears I hav yearned for thee.  I knowd thou wast in the world,sumwhares, tho I didn't know whare.  My hart sed he would cumand I took courage.  He HAS cum--he's here--you air him--youair my Affinerty!  O 'tis too mutch! too mutch!" and she sobbedagin."Yes," I anserd, "I think it is a darn site too mutch!""Hast thou not yearned for me?" she yelled, ringin her handslike a female play acter."Not a yearn!" I bellerd at the top of my voice, throwin heraway from me.The free lovers who was standin round obsarvin the scenecommenst for to holler "shame" "beast," etsettery, etsettery.I was very mutch riled, and fortifyin myself with a spare tentstake, I addrest them as follers:  "You pussylanermus critters,go way from me and take this retchid woman with you.  I'm alaw-abidin man, and beleeve in good, old-fashioned institutions.I am marrid & my orfsprings resemble me if I am a showman!  Ithink your Affinity bizniss is cussed noncents, besides beinoutrajusly wicked.  Why don't you behave desunt like otherfolks?  Go to work and earn a honist livin and not stay roundhere in this lazy, shiftless way, pizenin the moral atmospherewith your pestifrous ideas!  You wimin folks go back to yourlawful husbands if you've got any, and take orf them skanderlousgownds and trowsis, and dress respectful like other wimin.  Youmen folks, cut orf them pirattercal whiskers, burn up theminfurnel pamplits, put sum weskuts on, go to work choppin wood,splittin fence rales, or tillin the sile."  I pored 4th myindignashun in this way till I got out of breth, when I stopt.I shant go to Berlin Hites agin, not if I live to be as oldas Methooseler.1.15.  A VISIT TO BRIGHAM YOUNG.It is now goin on 2 (too) yeres, as I very well remember, sinceI crossed the Planes for Kaliforny, the Brite land of Jold.While crossin the Planes all so bold I fell in with sum noblered men of the forest (N.B.  This is rote Sarcasticul.  Injinsis Pizin, whar ever found,) which thay Sed I was their Brother,& wanted for to smoke the Calomel of Peace with me.  Thay thenstole my jerkt beef, blankits, etsettery, skalpt my orgingrinder & scooted with a Wild Hoop.  Durin the Cheaf's techinspeech he sed he shood meet me in the Happy Huntin Grounds.  Ifhe duz thare will be a fite.  But enuff of this ere.  "RevenNoose Muttons," as our skoolmaster, who has got Talent intohim, cussycally obsarve.I arrove at Salt Lake in doo time.  At Camp Scott there was alot of U.S. sogers, hosstensibly sent out there to smash theMormons but really to eat Salt vittles & play poker & otherbeautiful but sumwhat onsartin games.  I got acquainted withsum of the officers.  Thay lookt putty scrumpshus in theirBloo coats with brass buttings onto um & ware very talenteddrinkers, but so fur as fitin is consarned I'd willingly put mywax figgers agin the hull party.My desire was to exhibit my grate show in Salt Lake City, so Icalled on Brigham Yung, the grate mogull amung the mormins andaxed his permishun to pitch my tent and onfurl my banner to thejentle breezis.  He lookt at me in a austeer manner for a fewminits, and sed:"Do you bleeve in Solomon, Saint Paul, the immaculateness ofthe Mormin Church and the Latter-day Revelashuns?"Sez I, "I'm on it!"  I make it a pint to git along plesunt, thoI didn't know what under the Son the old feller was drivin at.He sed I mite show."You air a marrid man, Mister Yung, I bleeve?" sez I, preparinto rite him sum free parsis."I hev eighty wives, Mister Ward.  I sertinly am married.""How do you like it as far as you hev got?" sed I.He sed "middlin," and axed me wouldn't I like to see hisfamerly, to which I replide that I wouldn't mine minglin withthe fair Seck & Barskin in the winnin smiles of his interestinwives.  He accordingly tuk me to his Scareum.  The house ispowerful big & in a exceedin large room was his wives &children, which larst was squawkin and hollerin enuff to takethe roof rite orf the house.  The wimin was of all sizes andages.  Sum was pretty & sum was Plane--sum was helthy and sumwas on the Wayne--which is verses, tho sich was not myintentions, as I don't 'prove of puttin verses in Prozerittins, tho ef occashun requires I can Jerk a Poim ekal to anyof them Atlantic Munthly fellers."My wives, Mister Ward," sed Yung."Your sarvant, marms," sed I, as I sot down in a cheer which ared-heded female brawt me."Besides these wives you see here, Mister Ward," sed Yung, "Ihav eighty more in varis parts of this consecrated land whichair Sealed to me.""Which?" sez I, gittin up & starin at him."Sealed, Sir! sealed.""Whare bowts?" sez I."I sed, Sir, that they was sealed!"  He spoke in a traggerdyvoice."Will they probly continner on in that stile to any grateextent, Sir?" I axed."Sir," sed he, turnin as red as a biled beet, "don't you knowthat the rules of our Church is that I, the Profit, may hev asmeny wives as I wants?""Jes so," I sed.  "You are old pie, ain't you?""Them as is Sealed to me--that is to say, to be mine when Iwants um--air at present my sperretooul wives," sed MisterYung."Long may thay wave!" sez I, seein I shood git into a scrape efI didn't look out.In a privit conversashun with Brigham I learnt the follerinfax:  It takes him six weeks to kiss his wives.  He don't do itonly onct a yere & sez it is wuss nor cleanin house.  He don'tpretend to know his children, thare is so many of um, tho theyall know him.  He sez about every child he meats call him Par,& he takes it for grantid it is so.  His wives air veryexpensiv.  Thay allers want suthin & ef he don't buy it for umthay set the house in a uproar.  He sez he don't have a minit'speace.  His wives fite amung their selves so much that he hasbilt a fitin room for thare speshul benefit, & when too of 'emget into a row he has em turnd loose into that place, whare thedispoot is settled accordin to the rules of the London prizering.  Sum times thay abooz hisself individooally.  Thay hevpulled the most of his hair out at the roots & he wares meny ahorrible scar upon his body, inflicted with mop-handles,broom-sticks, and sich.  Occashunly they git mad & scald himwith bilin hot water.  When he got eny waze cranky thay'd shuthim up in a dark closit, previsly whippin him arter the stileof muthers when thare orfsprings git onruly.  Sumptimes when hewent in swimmin thay'd go to the banks of the Lake & steal allhis close, thereby compellin him to sneek home by a sircootiusrowt, drest in the Skanderlus stile of the Greek Slaiv.  "Ifind that the keers of a marrid life way hevy onto me," sed theProfit, "& sumtimes I wish I'd remaned singel."  I left theProfit and startid for the tavern whare I put up to.  On my wayI was overtuk by a lurge krowd of Mormons, which theysurroundid me & statid that they were goin into the Show free."Wall," sez I, "ef I find a individooal who is goin roundlettin folks into his show free, I'll let you know.""We've had a Revelashun biddin us go into A. Wards's Showwithout payin nothin!" thay showtid."Yes," hollered a lot of femaile Mormonesses, ceasin me by thecote tales & swingin me round very rapid, "we're all goin infree!  So sez the Revelashun!""What's Old Revelashun got to do with my show?" sez I, gittinputty rily.  "Tell Mister Revelashun," sed I, drawin myself upto my full hite and lookin round upon the ornery krowd with aprowd & defiant mean, "tell Mister Revelashun to mind his ownbizness, subject only to the Konstitushun of the UnitedStates!""Oh now let us in, that's a sweet man," sed several femails,puttin thare arms round me in luvin style.  "Become 1 of us.Becum a Preest & hav wives Sealed to you.""Not a Seal!" sez I, startin back in horror at the idee."Oh stay, Sir, stay," sed a tell, gawnt femaile, ore whoos hed37 summirs must hev parsd, "stay, & I'll be your JentleGazelle.""Not ef I know it, you won't," sez I. "Awa you skanderlusfemaile, awa!  Go & be a Nunnery!"  THAT'S WHAT I SED, JES SO."& I," sed a fat chunky femaile, who must hev wade more thantoo hundred lbs, "I will be your sweet gidin Star!"Sez I, "Ile bet two dollers and a half you won't!"  Whare ear Imay Rome Ile still be troo 2 thee, Oh Betsy Jane!  [N.B. BetsyJane is my wife's Sir naime.]"Wiltist thou not tarry here in the promist Land?" sed severalof the miserabil critters."Ile see you all essenshally cussed be4 I wiltist!" roared I,as mad as I cood be at thare infernul noncents.  I girdid up myLions & fled the Seen.  I packt up my duds & Left Salt Lake,which is a 2nd Soddum & Germorrer, inhabitid by as theavin &onprincipled a set of retchis as ever drew Breth in eny spot onthe Globe.1.16.  SCANDALOUS DOINGS AT PITTSBURG.Hear in the Buzzum of my famerly I am enjoyin myself, at peaswith awl mankind and the wimin folks likewise.  I go down tothe villige ockashunly and take a little old Rye fur thestummuck's sake, but I avoyd spiritus lickers as a ginralthing.  No man evir seen me intossikated but onct, and that airhappind in Pittsburg.  A parsel of ornery cusses in that luvlysity bustid inter the hawl durin the nite and aboosed my waxworks shaimful.  I didn't obsarve the outrajus transacshunsontil the next evening when the peple begun for to kongregate.Suddinly they kommensed fur to larf and holler in a boysteriousstile.  Sez I good peple what's up? Sez thay them's grate waxwurks, isn't they, old man.  I immejitly looked up ter wharethe wax works was, and my blud biles as I think of the sitewhich then met my Gase.  I hope two be dodrabbertid (Dod-rabitis an American euphemism for a profane expression which isquite as common in this country as on the other side of theAtlantic.) if them afoursed raskals hadent gone and put a oldkaved in hat onter George Washington's hed and shuved a shortblack klay pipe inter his mouth.  His noze thay had painted redand his trowsis legs thay had shuved inside his butes.  My waxfigger of Napoleon Boneypart was likewise mawltreatid.  Hissword wus danglin tween his legs, and his cockd hat was drawnklean down over his ize, and he was plased in a stoopinposishun lookin zactly as tho he was as drunk as a biled owl.Ginral Taylor was a standin on his hed and Wingfield Skott'skoat tales ware pind over his hed and his trowsis warekompleetly torn orf frum hisself.  My wax works representin theLord's Last Supper was likewise aboozed.  Three of the Postlesware under the table and two of um had on old tarpawlin hatsand raggid pee jackits and ware smokin pipes.  Judus Iskarriothad on a cocked hat and was appeerently drinkin, as a Bottle ofwhisky sot befour him.  This ere specktercal was too much furme.  I klosed the show and then drowndid my sorrers in theflowin Bole.1.17.  THE CENSUS.The Sences taker in our town bein taken sick, he deppertised meto go out for him one day, and as he was too ill to giv meinformashun how to perceed, I was consekently compelled to goit blind.  Sittin down by the road side, I drawd up thefollerin list of questions, which I proposed to ax the peple Ivisited:  Wat's your age?  Whar was you born?  Air you marrid, and if so how do you like it?  How many children hav you, and do they resemble you or your    naber?  Did you ever hav the measels, and if so how many?  Hav you a twin brother several years older than yourself?  How many parents hav you?  Do you read Watt's Hims regler?  Do you use boughten tobacker?(I.e., that which has been bought.  A very common word in theinterior of New England and New York.  It is applied toarticles purchased from the shops, to distinguish them fromarticles of home manufacture.  Many farmers make their ownsugar from the maple-tree, and their coffee from barley or rye.West India sugar or coffee is then called "boughten sugar," &c."This is a home-made carpet; that a 'boughten' one," i.e., onebought at a shop.  In the North of England, baker's bread iscalled "bought bread."  Wat's your fitin wate?  Air you trubeld with biles?  How does your meresham culler?  State whether you air blind, deaf, idiotic, or got the  heaves?  Do you know any Opry singers, and if so how much do they owe  you?  What's the average of virtoo on the Ery Canawl?  If 4 barrils of Emptins pored onto a barn floor will kiver  it, how many plase can Dion Bourcicault write in a year?[Emptyings, pronounced "emptins," the lees of beer, cider, &c.;yeast or anything by which bread is leavened:-"'Twill take more emptins, by a long chalk, than this new  party's got, To give such heavy cakes as these a start, I tell ye what."                                        "The Biglow Papers."]  Is Beans a regler article of diet in your family?  How many chickins hav you, on foot and in the shell?  Air you aware that Injianny whisky is used in New York  shootin galrys instid of pistols, and that it shoots furthest?  Was you ever at Niagry Falls?  Was you ever in the Penitentiary?  State how much pork, impendin crysis, Dutch cheeze, popler  suvrinty, standard poetry, children's strainers, slave code,  catnip, red flannel, ancient history, pickled tomaters, old  junk, perfoomery, coal ile, liberty, hoop skirt, &c., you hav  on hand?But it didn't work.  I got into a row at the fust house I stoptto, with some old maids.  Disbelieven the ansers they giv inregard to their ages, I endevered to open their mouths and lookat their teeth, same as they do with hosses, but they floo intoa vilent rage and tackled me with brooms and sich.  Takin thesences requires experiunse, like any other bizniss.1.18.  AN HONEST LIVING.I was on my way from the mines to San Francisco, with a lightpuss and a hevy hart.  You'd scacely hav recognized my fairform, so kiverd was I with dust.  Bimeby I met Old Poodles, theall-firdist gambler in the country.  He was afoot and in hisshirt-sleeves, and was in a wuss larther nor any race hoss Iever saw.  ("All-fired," enormous, excessive, a low Americanism,not improbably a puritanical corruption of "hell-fired,"designed to have the virtue of an oath without offending politeears.)"Whither goist thow, sweet nimp?" sez I, in a play-actin tone."To the mines, Sir," he unto me did say, "to the mines, TO EARNAN HONEST LIVIN."Thinks I that air aint very cool, I guess, and druv on.1.19.  THE PRESS.I want the editers to cum to my Show free as the flours of May,but I don't want um to ride a free hoss to deth.  Thare istimes when Patience seizes to be virtoous.  I had "in my mind'seye, Hurrashio" (cotashun from Hamlick) sum editers in a sertintown which shall be nameless, who air Both sneakin and ornery.They cum in krowds to my Show and then axt me ten sents a linefor Puffs.  I objectid to payin, but they sed ef I didn't downwith the dust thay'd wipe my Show from the face of the earth!Thay sed the Press was the Arkymedian Leaver which moved thewurld.  I put up to their extorshuns until thay'd bled me so Iwas a meer shadder, and left in disgust.It was in a surtin town in Virginny, the Muther of Presidents &things, that I was shaimfully aboozed by a editor in humanform.  He set my Show up steep & kalled me the urbane &gentlemunly manajer, but when I, fur the purpuss of showin fairplay all around, went to anuther offiss to git my hanbillsprinted, what duz this pussillanermus editer do but change histoon & abooze me like a Injun.  He sed my wax wurks was ahumbug & called me a horey-heded itinerent vagabone.  I thortat fust Ide pollish him orf ar-lar the Beneshy Boy, but onreflectin that he cood pollish me much wuss in his paper, I givit up.  & I wood here take occashun to advise peple when thayrun agin, as thay sumtimes will, these miserable papers, to notpay no attenshun to um.  Abuv all, don't assault a editer ofthis kind.  It only gives him a notorosity, which is jest whathe wants, & don't do you no more good than it wood to jump intoenny other mud puddle.  Editers are generally fine men, butthere must be black sheep in every flock.1.20.  EDWIN FOREST AS OTHELLO.Durin a recent visit to New York the undersined went to seeEdwin Forrest.  As I'm into the moral show bizness myself, Iginrally go to Barnum's moral Museum, where only moral pepleair admitted, pertickly on Wednesday arternoons.  But this timeI thot I'd go & see Ed.  Ed has bin actin out on the stage formany years.  There is varis 'pinions about his actin,Englishmen ginrally bleevin that he is far superior to MisterMacready; but on one pint all agree, & that is that Ed drawslike a six ox team.  Ed was actin at Niblo's Garding, whichlooks considerable more like a parster, than a garding, but letthat pars.  I sot down in the pit, took out my spectacles &commenced peroosin the evenin's bill.  The awjince was all-firedlarge & the boxes was full of the elitty of New York.  Severalopery glasses was leveld at me by Gothum's farest darters, butI didn't let on as tho I noticed it, tho mebby I did take outmy sixteen-dollar silver watch & brandish it round more than wasnecessary.  But the best of us has our weaknesses & if a man hasgewelry let him show it.  As I was peroosin the bill a graveyoung man who sot near me axed me if I'd ever seen Forrest dancethe Essence of Old Virginny?  "He's immense in that," sed theyoung man.  "He also does a fair champion jig," the young mancontinnerd, "but his Big Thing is the Essence of Old Virginny."Sez I, "Fair youth, do you know what I'd do with you if you wasmy sun?""No," sez he."Wall," sez I, "I'd appint your funeral tomorrow arternoon, &the KORPS SHOULD BE READY!  You're too smart to live on thisyearth."  He didn't try any more of his capers on me.  Butanother pussylanermus individooul, in a red vest & patentlether boots, told me his name was Bill Astor & axed me to lendhim 50 cents till early in the mornin.  I told him I'd problysend it round to him before he retired to his virtoous couch,but if I didn't he might look for it next fall, as soon as Icut my corn.  The Orchestry was now fiddling with all theirmight, & as the peple didn't understan anything about it theyapplaudid versifrussly.  Presently, Old Ed cum out.  The playwas Otheller or More of Veniss.  Otheller was writ by Wm.Shakspeer.  The scene is laid in Veniss.  Otheller was a likelyman & was a ginral in the Veniss army.  He eloped with Desdemony,a darter of the Hon. Mister Brabantio, who represented one ofthe back districks in the Veneshun legislater.  Old Brabantiowas as mad as thunder at this & tore round considerable, butfinally cooled down, tellin Otheller, howsever, that Desdemonyhad come it over her Par, & that he had better look out orshe'd come it over him likewise.  Mr. & Mrs. Otheller git alongvery comfortable like for a spell.  She is sweet-tempered andluvin--a nice, sensible female, never goin in for he-femaleconventions, green cotton umbrellers, and pickled beats.Otheller is a good provider and thinks all the world of hiswife.  She has a lazy time of it, the hired girl doin all thecookin and washin.  Desdemony, in fact, don't have to git thewater to wash her own hands with.  But a low cuss named Iago,who I bleeve wants to git Otheller out of his snug governmentbirth, now goes to work & upsets the Otheller family in themost outrajus stile.  Iago falls in with a brainless youthnamed Roderigo & wins all his money at poker.  (Iago allersplayed foul.)  He thus got money enuff to carry out hisonprincipled skeem.  Mike Cassio, a Irishman, is selected as atool by Iago.  Mike was a clever feller & orficer in Otheller'sarmy.  He liked his tods too well, howsever, & they flooredhim, as they have many other promisin young men. Iago injucesMike to drink with him, Iago slyly throwin his whiskey over hisshoulder.  Mike gits as drunk as a biled owl & allows that hecan lick a yard full of the Veneshun fancy before breakfast,without sweatin a hair. He meets Roderigo & proceeds for tosmash him.  A feller named Montano undertakes to slap Cassio,when that infatooated person runs his sword into him.  Thatmiserble man, Iago, pretents to be very sorry to see Mikeconduck hisself in this way & undertakes to smooth the thingover to Otheller, who rushes in with a drawn sword & wants toknow what's up.  Iago cunningly tells his story, & Othellertells Mike that he thinks a good deal of him, but he can'ttrain no more in his regiment.  Desdemony sympathizes with poorMike & interceeds for him with Otheller.  Iago makes him bleeveshe does this because she thinks more of Mike than she does ofhisself.  Otheller swallers Iago's lyin tail & goes to makin anoosence of hisself ginrally.  He worries poor Desdemonyterrible by his vile insinuations, & finally smothers her todeth with a piller.  Mrs. Iago cums in just as Otheller hasfinished the fowl deed & givs him fits right & left, showin himthat he has bin orfully gulled by her miserble cuss of ahusband.  Iago cums in, & his wife commences rakin him downalso, when he stabs her.  Otheller jaws him a spell & then cutsa small hole in his stummick with his sword.  Iago pints toDesdemony's deth bed & goes orf with a sardonic smile onto hiscountenance.  Otheller tells the peple that he has dun thestate sum service & they know it; axes them to do as fair athing as they can for him under the circumstances, & killshisself with a fish-knife, which is the most sensible thing hecan do.  This is a breef skedule of the synopsis of the play.Edwin Forrest is a grate acter.  I thot I saw Otheller beforeme all the time he was actin, & when the curtin fell, I foundmy spectacles was still mistened with salt-water, which had runfrom my eyes while poor Desdemony was dyin.  Betsy Jane--BetsyJane! let us pray that our domestic bliss may never be bustedup by a Iago!Edwin Forrest makes money actin out on the stage.  He gitsfive-hundred dollars a nite & his board & washin.  I wish I hadsuch a Forrest in my Garding!1.21.  THE SHOW BUSINESS AND POPULAR LECTURES.I feel that the Show Bizniss, which Ive stroven to ornyment, isbein usurpt by Poplar Lecturs, as thay air kalled, tho in mypinion thay air poplar humbugs.  Individoouls, who git hard up,embark in the lecturin biznis.  They cram theirselves withhi-sounding frazis, frizzle up their hare, git trustid for a sootof black close & cum out to lectur at 50 dollers a pop.  Thayaint over stockt with branes, but thay hav brass enuff to makesuffishunt kittles to bile all the sope that will be requiredby the ensooin sixteen ginerashuns.  Peple flock to heer um inkrowds.  The men go becawz its poplar & the wimin folks go tosee what other wimin folks have on.  When its over the lecturergoze & ragales hisself with oysters and sich, while the peplesay, "What a charmin lectur that air was," etsettery,etsettery, when 9 out of 10 of um don't have no moore idee ofwhat the lecturer sed than my kangeroo has of the sevunth speerof hevun.  Thare's moore infurmashun to be gut out of a wellconductid noospaper--price 3 sents--than thare is out of tenpoplar lectures at 25 or 50 dollers a pop, as the kase may be.These same peple, bare in mind, stick up their nosis at moralwax figgers & sagashus beests.  Thay say these things is low.Gents, it greeves my hart in my old age, when I'm in "the Sheer& yeller leef" (to cote frum my Irish frend Mister McBeth) tosee that the Show biznis is pritty much plade out; howsomever Ishall chance it agane in the Spring.1.22.  WOMAN'S RIGHTS.I pitcht my tent in a small town in Injianny one day lastseeson, & while I was standin at the dore takin money, adeppytashun of ladies came up & sed they wos members of theBunkumville Female Moral Reformin & Wimin's Rite's Associashun,and thay axed me if they cood go in without payin."Not exactly," sez I, "but you can pay without goin in.""Dew you know who we air?" sed one of the wimin--a tall andferoshus lookin critter, with a blew kotton umbreller under herarm--"do you know who we air, Sir?""My impreshun is," sed I, "from a kersery view, that you airfemales.""We air, Sur," sed the feroshus woman--"we belong to a Societywhitch beleeves wimin has rites--whitch beleeves in razin herto her proper speer--whitch beleeves she is indowed with asmuch intelleck as man is--whitch beleeves she is trampled onand aboozed--& who will resist henso4th & forever theincroachments of proud & domineering men."Durin her discourse, the exsentric female grabed me by thecoat-kollor & was swinging her umbreller wildly over my hed."I hope, marm," sez I, starting back, "that your intensions ishonorable!  I'm a lone man hear in a strange place.  Besides,I've a wife to hum.""Yes," cried the female, "& she's a slave!  Doth she neverdream of freedom--doth she never think of throwin off the yokeof tyrrinny & thinkin & votin for herself?--Doth she neverthink of these here things?""Not bein a natral born fool," sed I, by this time a littleriled, "I kin safely say that she dothunt.""Oh whot--whot!" screamed the female, swingin her umbreller inthe air.--"O, what is the price that woman pays for herexpeeriunce!""I don't know," sez I; "the price of my show is 15 cents purindividooal.""& can't our Soisety go in free?" asked the female."Not if I know it," sed I."Crooil, crooil man!" she cried, & bust into teers."Won't you let my darter in?" sed anuther of the exsentricwimin, taken me afeckshunitely by the hand.  "O, please let mydarter in,--shee's a sweet gushin child of natur.""Let her gush!" roared I, as mad as I cood stick at theirtarnal nonsense; "let her gush!"  Where upon they all sprungback with the simultanious observashun that I was a Beest."My female friends," sed I, "be4 you leeve, I've a few remarksto remark; wa them well.  The female woman is one of thegreatest institooshuns of which this land can boste.  Itsonpossible to get along without her.  Had there bin no femalewimin in the world, I should scarcely be here with myunparalleld show on this very occashun.  She is good insickness--good in wellness--good all the time.  O woman,woman!" I cried, my feelins worked up to a hi poetick pitch,"you air a angle when you behave yourself; but when you takeoff your proper appairel & (mettyforically speaken)--get intopantyloons--when you desert your firesides, & with your hedsfull of wimin's rites noshuns go round like roarin lions,seekin whom you may devour someboddy--in short, when youundertake to play the man, you play the devil and air anemfatic noosance.  My female friends," I continnered, as theywere indignantly departin, "wa well what A. Ward has sed!"1.23.  WOULD-BE SEA DOGS.Sum of the captings on the Upper Ohio River put on a heep ofairs.  To hear 'em git orf saler lingo you'd spose they'd binon the briny Deep for a lifetime, when the fact is they hainttasted salt water since they was infants, when they had to takeit for WORMS.  Still they air good natered fellers, and whenthey drink they take a dose big enuff for a grown person.1.24.  THE PRINCE OF WALES.To my friends of the Editorial Corpse:I rite these lines on British sile.  I've bin follerin Mrs.Victory's hopeful sun Albert Edward threw Kanady with myonparaleled Show, and tho I haint made much in a pecoonary pintof vew, I've lernt sumthin new, over hear on British Sile,whare they bleeve in Saint George and the Dragoon.  Previs tocumin over hear I tawt my organist how to grind Rule Brittanyand other airs which is poplar on British Sile.  I likewisefixt a wax figger up to represent Sir Edmun Hed the GovnerGinral.  The statoot I fixt up is the most versytile waxstatoot I ever saw.  I've showd it as Wm. Penn, NapoleonBonypart, Juke of Wellington, the Beneker Boy, Mrs. Cunningham& varis other notid persons, and also for a sertin pirut namedHix.  I've bin so long amung wax statoots that I can fix 'em upto soot the tastes of folks, & with sum paints I hav I kin givtheir facis a beneverlent or fiendish look as the kaserequires.  I giv Sir Edmun Hed a beneverlent look, & when sumfolks who thawt they was smart sed it didn't look like SirEdmun Hed anymore than it did anybody else, I sed, "That's thepint.  That's the beauty of the Statoot.  It looks like SirEdmun Hed or any other man.  You may kall it what you pleese.Ef it don't look like anybody that ever lived, then it'ssertinly a remarkable Statoot & well worth seein.  _I_  kall itSir Edmun Hed.  YOU may kall it what you pleese!"  [I had 'emthare.]At larst I've had a interview with the Prince, tho it puttynigh cost me my vallerble life.  I cawt a glimpse of him as hesot on the Pizarro of the hotel in Sarnia, & elbowd myselfthrew a crowd of wimin, children, sojers & Injins that washangin round the tavern.  I was drawin near to the Prince whena red-faced man in Millingtery close grabd holt of me and axedme whare I was goin all so bold?"To see Albert Edard the Prince of Wales," sez I; "who areyou?"He sed he was Kurnel of the Seventy Fust Regiment, HerMagisty's troops.  I told him I hoped the Seventy Onesters wasin good helth, and was passin by when he ceased hold of meagin, and sed in a tone of indigent cirprise:"What?  Impossible!  It kannot be!  Blarst my hize, sir, did Iunderstan you to say that you was actooally goin into thepresents of his Royal Iniss?""That's what's the matter with me," I replide."But blarst my hize, sir, its onprecedented.  It's orful, sir.Nothin' like it hain't happened sins the Gun Powder Plot of GuyForks.  Owdashus man, who air you?""Sir," sez I, drawin myself up & puttin on a defiant air, "I'ma Amerycan sitterzen.  My name is Ward.  I'm a husband & thefather of twins, which I'm happy to state thay look like me.By perfeshun I'm a exhibiter of wax works & sich.""Good God!" yelled the Kurnal, "the idee of a exhibiter of waxfiggers goin into the presents of Royalty!  The British Lionmay well roar with raje at the thawt!"Sez I, "Speakin of the British Lion, Kurnal, I'd like to make abargin with you fur that beast fur a few weeks to add to myShow."  I didn't meen nothin by this.  I was only gettin orf agoak, but you roter hev seen the Old Kurnal jump up & howl.  Heactooally fomed at the mowth."This can't be real," he showtid.  "No, no.  It's a horriddream.  Sir, you air not a human bein--you hav no existents--yure a Myth!""Wall," sez I, "old hoss, yule find me a ruther onkomfortableMyth ef you punch my inards in that way agin."  I began to gita little riled, fur when he called me a Myth he puncht me puttyhard.  The Kurnal now commenst showtin fur the Seventy Onesters.I at fust thawt I'd stay & becum a Marter to British Outraje,as sich a course mite git my name up & be a good advertisementfur my Show, but it occurred to me that ef enny of the SeventyOnesters shood happen to insert a barronet into my stummick itmite be onplesunt, & I was on the pint of runnin orf when thePrince hisself kum up & axed me what the matter was.  Sez I,"Albert Edard, is that you?" & he smilt & sed it was.  Sez I,"Albert Edard, hears my keerd.  I cum to pay my respecks tothe futer King of Ingland.  The Kurnal of the Seventy Onestershear is ruther smawl pertaters, but of course you ain't to blamefur that.  He puts on as many airs as tho he was the Bully Boywith the glass eye.""Never mind," sez Albert Edard, "I'm glad to see you, MisterWard, at all events," & he tuk my hand so plesunt like & larfedso sweet that I fell in love with him to onct.  He handid me asegar & we sot down on the Pizarro & commenst smokin ritecheerful.  "Wall," sez I, "Albert Edard, how's the old folks?""Her Majesty & the Prince are well," he sed."Duz the old man take his Lager beer reglar?"  I inquired.The Prince larfed & intermatid that the old man didn't let manykegs of that bevridge spile in the sellar in the coarse of ayear.  We sot & tawked there sum time abowt matters & things, &bimeby I axed him how he liked bein Prince as fur as he'd got."To speak plain, Mister Ward," he sed, "I don't much like it.I'm sick of all this bowin & scrapin & crawlin & hurrain over aboy like me.  I would rather go through the country quietly &enjoy myself in my own way, with the other boys, & not be madea Show of to be garped at by everybody.  When the PEPLE cheer meI feel pleesed, fur I know they meen it; but if these one-horseoffishuls cood know how I see threw all their moves & understanexackly what they air after, & knowd how I larft at 'em inprivate, thayd stop kissin my hands & fawnin over me as thay nowdo.  But you know, Mr. Ward, I can't help bein a Prince, & Imust do all I kin to fit myself fur the persishun I must sumtimeockepy.""That's troo," sez I; "sickness and the docters will carry theQueen orf one of these dase, sure's yer born."The time hevin arove fur me to take my departer I rose up &sed:  "Albert Edard, I must go, but previs to doin so I willobsarve that you soot me.  Yure a good feller, Albert Edard, &tho I'm agin Princes as a gineral thing, I must say I like thecut of your Gib.  When you git to be King try and be as good aman as yure muther has bin!  Be just & be Jenerus, espeshullyto showmen, who hav allers bin aboozed sins the dase of Noah,who was the fust man to go into the Menagery bizniss, & ef thedaily papers of his time air to be beleeved Noah's colleckshunof livin wild beests beet ennything ever seen sins, tho I makebold to dowt ef his snaiks was ahead of mine.  Albert Edard,adoo!"  I tuk his hand which he shook warmly, & givin him aperpetooal free pars to my show, & also parses to take hum forthe Queen & old Albert, I put on my hat and walkt away."Mrs. Ward," I solilerquized, as I walkt along, "Mrs. Ward, efyou could see your husband now, just as he prowdly emerjis fromthe presunts of the futur King of Ingland, you'd be sorry youcalled him a Beest jest becaws he cum home tired 1 nite andwantid to go to bed without takin orf his boots.  You'd besorry for tryin to deprive yure husband of the priceliss Boonof liberty, Betsy Jane!"Jest then I met a long perseshun of men with gownds onto 'em.The leader was on horseback, & ridin up to me he sed, "Air youOrange?"Sez I, "Which?""Air you a Orangeman?" he repeated, sternly."I used to peddle lemins," sed I, "but I never delt in oranges.They are apt to spile on yure hands.  What particler LoonaticAsylum hev you & yure frends escaped frum, ef I may be sobold?"  Just then a suddent thawt struck me & I sed, "Oh yurethe fellers who air worryin the Prince so & givin the Juke ofNoocastle cold sweats at nite, by yure infernal catawalins, airyou?  Wall, take the advice of a Amerykin sitterzen, take orfthem gownds & don't try to get up a religious fite, which is 40times wuss nor a prize fite, over Albert Edard, who wants toreceive you all on a ekal footin, not keerin a tinker's cusswhat meetin house you sleep in Sundays.  Go home & mind yurebisness & not make noosenses of yourselves."  With whichobservashuns I left 'em.I shall leeve British sile 4thwith.1.25.  PICCOLOMINI.Gents,--I arroved in Cleveland on Saturday P.M. fromBaldinsville jest in time to fix myself up and put on a cleanbiled rag to attend Miss Picklehomony's grate musical sorry atthe Melodeon.  The krowds which pored into the hall auguredwell for the show bizniss, & with cheerful sperrets I jined theenthoosiastic throng.  I asked Mr. Strakhosh at the door if heparst the perfession, and he sed not much he didn't, whereuponI bawt a preserved seat in the pit, & obsarving to Mr.Strakhosh that he needn't put on so many French airs becawz herun with a big show, and that he'd better let his weskut out afew inches or perhaps he'd bust hisself some fine day, I wentin and squatted down.  It was a sad thawt to think that in allthat vast aujience Scacely a Sole had the honor of myacquaintance.  "& this ere," sed I Bitturly, "is Fame!  Whatsigerfy my wax figgers and livin wild beasts (which have noekels) to these peple?  What do thay care becawz a site of myKangeroo is worth dubble the price of admission, and that mySnaiks is as harmlis as the new born babe--all of which isstrictly troo?"  I should have gone on ralein at Fortin andthings sum more, but jest then Signer Maccarony cum out andsung a hairey from some opry or other.  He had on his storeclose & looked putty slick, I must say.  Nobody didn'tunderstand nothin abowt what he sed, and so they applawdid himversiferusly.  Then Signer Brignoly cum out and sung anotherhairey.  He appeared to be in a Pensiv Mood & sung a Luv song Isuppose, tho he may have been cussin the aujince all into aheep for aut I knewd.  Then cum Mr. Maccarony agin and MissPicklehomony herself.  Thay sang a Doit together.Now you know, gents, that I don't admire opry music.  But Ilike Miss Picklehomony's stile.  I like her gate.  She suitsme.  There has bin grater singers and there has bin morebootiful wimin, but no more fassinatin young female ever longedfor a new gown, or side to place her hed agin a vest patternthan Maria Picklehomony.  Fassinatin peple is her best holt.She was born to make hash of men's buzzums & other wimin madbecawz thay ain't Picklehomonies.  Her face sparkles withamuzin cussedness & about 200 (two hundred) little bit of funnydevils air continually dancing champion jigs in her eyes, sedeyes bein brite enuff to lite a pipe by.  How I shood like tohave little Maria out on my farm in Baldinsville, Injianny, whareshe cood run in the tall grass, wrastle with the boys, cut upstrong at parin bees, make up faces behind the minister's back,tie auction bills to the skoolmaster's coat-tales, set all thefellers crazy after her, & holler & kick up, & go it just asmuch as she wanted to!  But I diegress.  Every time she cumcanterin out I grew more and more delighted with her.  When shebowed her hed I bowed mine.  When she powtid her lips I powtidmine.  When she larfed I larfed.  When she jerked her hed backand took a larfin survey of the aujience, sendin a broadside ofsassy smiles in among em, I tried to unjint myself & kollapse.When, in tellin how she drempt she lived in Marble Halls, shesed it tickled her more than all the rest to dream she lovedher feller still the same, I made a effort to swaller myself;but when, in the next song, she look strate at me & called meher Dear, I wildly told the man next to me he mite hav my close,as I shood never want 'em again no more in this world.  [The"Plain Dealer" (The Cleveland "Plain Dealer," a well-knownOhio newspaper, to which Mr. Artemus Ward wishes us tounderstand he contributed.) containin this communicashun isnot to be sent to my famerly in Baldinsville under nocircumstances whatsomever.]In conclushun, Maria, I want you to do well.  I know you air anice gal at hart & you must get a good husband.  He must be a manof branes and gumpshun & a good provider--a man who will luv youstrong and long--a man who will luv you jest as much in your oldage, when your voice is cracked like an old tea kittle & you can'tget 1 of your notes discounted at 50 per sent a month, as he willnow, when you are young & charmin & full of music, sunshine & fun.Don't marry a snob, Maria.  You ain't a Angel, Maria, & I am gladof it.  When I see angels in pettycoats I'm always sorry theyhain't got wings so they kin quietly fly off whare thay will beappreshiated.  You air a woman, & a mity good one too.  As forMaccarony, Brignoly, Mullenholler, and them other fellers, they cantake care of theirselves.  Old Mac. kin make a comfortable livinchoppin cord wood if his voice ever givs out, and Amodio looks astho he mite succeed in conductin sum quiet toll gate, whare thevittles would be plenty & the labor lite.I am preparin for the Summer Campane.  I shall stay in Cleveland afew days and probly you will hear from me again ear I leave to oncemore becum a tosser on life's tempestuous billers, meanin the ShowBizniss.--Very Respectively Yours,Artemus Ward.1.26.  LITTLE PATTI.The moosic which Ime most use to is the inspirin stranes of thehand orgin. I hire a artistic Italyun to grind fur me, payin himhis vittles & close, & I spose it was them stranes which fust put amoosical taste into me.  Like all furriners, he had seen betterdase, havin formerly been a Kount.  But he aint of much akount now,except to turn the orgin and drink Beer, of which bevrige he canhold a churnful, EASY.Miss Patty is small for her size, but as the man sed abowt hiswife, O Lord!  She is well bilt & her complexion is what might becalled a Broonetty.  Her ize is a dark bay, the lashes bein long &silky.  When she smiles the awjince feels like axing her to doo itsum moor, & to continner doin it 2 a indefnit extent.  Her waste isone of the most bootiful wastisis ever seen.  When MisterStrackhorse led her out I thawt sum pretty skool gal, who had jestgraduatid frum pantalets & wire hoops, was a cumin out to read herfust composishun in public.  She cum so bashful like, with her hedbowd down, & made sich a effort to arrange her lips so thayd lookpretty, that I wanted to swaller her.  She reminded me of SusanSkinner, who'd never kiss the boys at parin bees till the candleswas blow'd out.  Miss Patty sung suthin or ruther in a furrin tung.I don't know what the sentimunts was.  Fur awt I know she may havbin denouncin my wax figgers & sagashus wild beests of Pray, & Idon't much keer ef she did.  When she opened her mowth a army ofmartingales, bobolinks, kanarys, swallers, mockin birds, etsettery,bust 4th& flew all over the Haul.Go it, little 1, sez I to myself, in a hily exsited frame of mind,& ef that kount or royal duke which you'll be pretty apt to marry 1of these dase don't do the fair thing by ye, yu kin always hav ahome on A. Ward's farm, near Baldinsville, Injianny.  When she sungCumin threw the Rye, and spoke of that Swayne she deerly luvdherself individooully, I didn't wish I was that air Swayne.  No Igess not.  Oh certainly not.  [This is Ironical.  I don't meenthis.  It's a way I hav of goakin.]  Now that Maria Picklehominyhas got married & left the perfeshun, Adeliny Patty is thechampioness of the opery ring.  She karries the Belt.  Thar's nodraw fite about it.  Other primy donnys may as well throw up thespunge first as last.  My eyes don't deceive my earsite in thismatter.But Miss Patty orter sing in the Inglish tung.  As she kin do so aswell as she kin in Italyun, why under the Son don't she do it?What cents is thare in singin wurds nobody don't understan whenwurds we do understan is jest as handy?  Why peple willversifferusly applawd furrin langwidge is a mistery.  It reminds meof a man I onct knew.  He sed he knockt the bottum out of his porkBarril, & the pork fell out, but the Brine dident moove a inch.  Itstade in the Barril.  He sed this was a Mistery, but it wasn'tmisterior than is this thing I'm speekin of.As fur Brignoly, Ferri and Junky, they air dowtless grate, but Ithink sich able boddied men wood look better tillin the sile thandressin theirselves up in black close & white kid gluvs & shoutinin a furrin tung.  Mister Junky is a noble lookin old man, & orterlead armies on to Battel instid of shoutin in a furrin tung.Adoo.  In the langwidge of Lewis Napoleon when receivin kumpany athis pallis on the Bullyvards, "I saloot yu."1.27.  OSSAWATOMIE BROWN.I don't pertend to be a cricket & consekently the reader will notregard this 'ere peace as a Cricketcism.  I cimply desine givin thepints & Plot of a play I saw actid out at the theatre t'other nite,called Ossywattermy Brown or the Hero of Harper's Ferry.Ossywattermy had varis failins, one of which was a idee that hecood conker Virginny with a few duzzen loonatics which he had picktup sumwhares, mercy only nose wher.  He didn't cum it, as the sekelshowed.  This play was jerkt by a admirer of Old Ossywattermy.First akt opens at North Elby, Old Brown's humsted.  Thare's aweddin at the house.  Amely, Old Brown's darter, marrys sumbody,and thay all whirl in the Messy darnce.  Then Ossywattermy and his3 sons leave fur Kansis.  Old Mrs. Ossywattermy tells 'em thay airgoin on a long jurny & Blesses 'em to slow fiddlin.  Thay go toKansis.  What upon arth thay go to Kansis fur when thay was so nice& comfortable down there to North Elby, is more'n I know.  The sunsair next seen in Kansis at a tarvern.  Mister Blane, a sinisterlookin man with his Belt full of knives & hoss pistils, axes one ofthe Browns to take a drink.  Brown refuzis, which is the fustinstance on record whar a Brown deklined sich a invite.  MisterBlane, who is a dark bearded feroshus lookin person, then axis himwhether he's fur or fernenst Slavery.  Yung Brown sez he's agin it,whareupon, Mister Blane, who is the most sinisterest lookin man Iever saw, sez Har, har, har! (that bein his stile of larfin wildly)& ups and sticks a knife into yung Brown.  Anuther Brown rushes up& sez, "you has killed me Ber-ruther!"  Moosic by the Band & Seenchanges.  The stuck yung Brown enters supported by his twobrothers. Bimeby he falls down, sez he sees his Mother, & dies.Moosic by the Band. I lookt but couldn't see any mother.  Next Seenreveels Old Brown's cabin. He's readin a book.  He sez freedum mustextend its Area & rubs his hands like he was pleesed abowt it.  Hissuns come in.  One of 'em goes out & cums in ded, havin bin shotwhile out by a Border Ruffin.  The ded yung Brown sez he sees hismother and tumbles down.  The Border Ruffins then surround thecabin & set it a fire.  The Browns giv theirselves up for gonecoons, when the hired gal diskivers a trap door to the cabin & thaygo down threw it & cum up threw the bulkhed.  Their merraklis'scape reminds me of the 'scape of De Jones, the Coarsehair of theGulf--a tail with a yaller kiver, that I onct red.  For sixteenyears he was confined in a loathsum dunjin, not tastin food durinall that time.  When a lucky thawt struck him!  He opend the winderand got out.  To resoom--Old Brown rushes down to the footlites,gits down on his nees & swares he'll hav revenge.  The battle ofOssawatermy takes place.  Old Brown kills Mister Blane, thesinister individooal aforesed.  Mister Blane makes a able &elerquent speech, sez he don't see his mother MUCH, and dies likethe son of a gentleman, rapt up in the Star Spangled banner.Moosic by the Band.  Four or five other Border ruffins air killed,but thay don't say nothin abowt seein their mothers.  From Kansisto Harper's Ferry.  Picter of a Arsenal is represented.  Sojers cum& fire at it.  Old Brown cums out & permits hisself to be shot.  Heis tride by two soops in milingtery close and sentenced to be hungon the gallus.  Tabloo--Old Brown on a platform, pintin upards, thestaige lited up with red fire.  Goddis of Liberty also on platform,pintin upards.  A dutchman in the orkestry warbles on a base drum.Curtin falls.  Moosic by the Band.1.28.  JOY IN THE HOUSE OF WARD.Dear Sirs:I take my pen in hand to inform you that I am in a state of greatbliss, and trust these lines will find you injoyin the sameblessins.  I'm reguvinated.  I've found the immortal waters ofyooth, so to speak, and am as limber and frisky as a two-year-oldsteer, and in the futur them boys which sez to me "go up, old Bawldhed," will do so at the peril of their hazard, individooally.  I'mvery happy.  My house is full of joy, and I have to git up nightsand larf!  Sumtimes I ax myself "is it not a dream?" & suthinwithinto me sez "it air;" but when I look at them sweet littlecritters and hear 'em squawk, I know it is a reality--2 realitys, Imay say--and I feel gay.I returnd from the Summer Campane with my unparaleld show of waxworks and livin wild Beests of Pray in the early part of thismunth.  The peple of Baldinsville met me cordully and I immejitlycommenst restin myself with my famerly.  The other nite while I wasdown to the tavurn tostin my shins agin the bar room fire & amuzinthe krowd with sum of my adventurs, who shood cum in bare heded &terrible excited but Bill Stokes, who sez, sez he, "Old Ward,there's grate doins up to your house."Sez I "William, how so?"Sez he, "Bust my gizzud but it's grate doins," & then he larfed asif he'd kill hisself.Sez I, risin and puttin on a austeer look, "William, I woodunt be afool if I had common cents."But he kept on larfin till he was black in the face, when he fellover on to the bunk where the hostler sleeps, and in a still smallvoice sed, "Twins!"  I ashure you gents that the grass didn't growunder my feet on my way home, & I was follered by a enthoosiasticthrong of my feller sitterzens, who hurrard for Old Ward at the topof their voises.  I found the house chock full of peple.  Thare wasMis Square Baxter and her three grown-up darters, lawyer Perkinseswife, Taberthy Ripley, young Eben Parsuns, Deakun Simmuns folks,the Skoolmaster, Doctor Jordin, etsetterry, etsetterry.  Mis Wardwas in the west room, which jines the kitchen.  Mis Square Baxterwas mixin suthin in a dipper before the kitchin fire, & a smallarmy of female wimin were rushin wildly round the house withbottles of camfire, peaces of flannil, &c. I never seed such ahubbub in my natral born dase.  I cood not stay in the west roomonly a minit, so strung up was my feelins, so I rusht out andceased my dubbel barrild gun."What upon airth ales the man?" sez Taberthy Ripley.  "Sakes alive,what air you doin?" & she grabd me by the coat tales.  "What's thematter with you?" she continnerd."Twins, marm," sez I, "twins!""I know it," sez she, coverin her pretty face with her apun."Wall," sez I, "that's what's the matter with me!""Wall, put down that air gun, you pesky old fool," sed she."No, marm," sez I, "this is a Nashunal day.  The glory of this hereday isn't confined to Baldinsville by a darn site.  On yonderwoodshed," sed I, drawin myself up to my full hite and speakin in ashow-actin voice, "will I fire a Nashunal saloot!" sayin whitch Itared myself from her grasp and rusht to the top of the shed whareI blazed away until Square Baxter's hired man and my son ArtemusJuneyer cum and took me down by mane force.On returnin to the Kitchin I found quite a lot of peple seated be4the fire, a talkin the event over.  They made room for me & I sotdown.  "Quite a eppisode," sed Docter Jordin, litin his pipe with ared-hot coal."Yes," sed I, "2 eppisodes, waying abowt 18 pounds jintly.""A perfeck coop de tat," sed the skoolmaster."E pluribus unum, in proprietor persony," sed I, thinking I'd lethim know I understood furrin langwidges as well as he did, if Iwasn't a skoolmaster."It is indeed a momentious event," sed young Eben Parsuns, who hasbeen 2 quarters to the Akademy."I never heard twins called by that name afore," sed I, "But Ispose it's all rite.""We shall soon have Wards enuff," sed the editer of theBaldinsville "Bugle of Liberty," who was lookin over a bundle ofexchange papers in the corner, "to apply to the legislater for aCity Charter!""Good for you, old man!" sed I; "giv that air a conspickius placein the next "Bugle.""How redicklus," sed pretty Susan Fletcher, coverin her face withher knittin work & larfin like all possest."Wall, for my part," sed Jane Maria Peasly, who is the crossest oldmade in the world, "I think you all act like a pack of fools."Sez I, "Miss Peasly, air you a parent?"Sez she, "No, I ain't."Sez I, "Miss Peasly, you never will be."She left.We sot there talkin & larfin until "the switchin hour of nite, whengrave yards yawn & Josts troop 4th," as old Bill Shakespire aptleeobsarves in his dramy of John Sheppard, esq, or the Moral HouseBreaker, when we broke up & disbursed.Muther & children is a doin well & as Resolushuns is the order ofthe day I will feel obleeged if you'll insurt the follerin--Whereas, two Eppisodes has happined up to the undersined's house,which is Twins; & Whereas I like this stile, sade twins bein of themale perswashun & both boys; there4 Be it--RESOLVED, That to them nabers who did the fare thing by sadeEppisodes my hart felt thanks is doo.RESOLVED, That I do most hartily thank Engine Ko.

WARD TO HIS WIFE.)Dear Betsy:  I write you this from Boston, "the Modern Atkins," asit is denomyunated, altho' I skurcely know what those air.  I'llgiv you a kursoory view of this city.  I'll klassify the paragrafsunder seprit headins, arter the stile of those Emblems of Troothand Poority, the Washinton correspongdents!COPP'S HILL.The winder of my room commands a exileratin view of Copps' Hill,where Cotton Mather, the father of the Reformers and sich, liesberrid.  There is men even now who worship Cotton, and there iswimin who wear him next their harts.  But I do not weep for him.He's bin ded too lengthy.  I ain't going to be absurd, like old Mr.Skillins, in our naberhood, who is ninety-six years of age, andgets drunk every 'lection day, and weeps Bitturly because he haintgot no Parents.  He's a nice Orphan, HE is.BUNKER HILL.Bunker Hill is over yonder in Charleston.  In 1776 a thrillin dramywas acted out over there, in which the "Warren Combination" playedstar parts.MR. FANUEL.Old Mr. Fanuel is ded, but his Hall is still into full blarst.This is the Cradle in which the Goddess of Liberty was rocked, myDear.  The Goddess hasn't bin very well durin' the past few years,and the num'ris quack doctors she called in didn't help her any;but the old gal's physicians now are men who understand theirbizness, Major-generally speakin', and I think the day is near whenshe'll be able to take her three meals a day, and sleep nights ascomf'bly as in the old time.THE COMMON.It is here, as ushil; and the low cuss who called it a Wacant Lot,and wanted to know why they didn't ornament it with sum Bildins',is a onhappy Outcast in Naponsit.THE LEGISLATUR.The State House is filled with Statesmen, but sum of 'em wear queerhats.  They buy 'em, I take it, of hatters who carry on hat storesdown-stairs in Dock Square, and whose hats is either ten yearsahead of the prevailin' stile, or ten years behind it--jest as aintellectooal person sees fit to think about it.  I had thepleasure of talkin' with sevril members of the legislatur.  I told'em the Eye of 1000 ages was onto we American peple of to-day.They seemed deeply impressed by the remark, and wantid to know if Ihad seen the Grate Orgin?HARVARD COLLEGE.This celebrated institootion of learnin is pleasantly situated inthe Bar-room of Parker's in School street, and has poopils from allover the country.I had a letter yes'd'y, by the way, from our mootual son, Artemus,Jr., who is at Bowdoin College in Maine.  He writes that he's aBowdoin Arab. & is it cum to this?  Is this Boy as I nurtered witha Parent's care into his childhood's hour--is he goin' to be aGrate American humorist?  Alars!  I fear it is too troo.  Whydidn't I bind him out to the Patent Travellin Vegetable Pill Man,as was struck with his appearance at our last County Fair, & wantedhim to go with him and be a Pillist?  Ar, these Boys--they littleknow how the old folks worrit about 'em.  But my father he neverhad no occasion to worrit about me.  You know, Betsy, that when Ifust commenced my career as a moral exhibitor with a six-legged catand a Bass drum, I was only a simple peasant child--skurce 15Summers had flow'd over my yoothful hed.  But I had sum mind of myown.  My father understood this. "Go," he sed--"go, my son, and hogthe public!" (he ment, "knock em," but the old man was allus alittle given to slang).  He put his withered han' tremblinly ontomy hed, and went sadly into the house.  I thought I saw tearstricklin down his venerable chin, but it might hav been tobackerjooce.  He chaw'd.LITERATOOR.The "Atlantic Monthly," Betsy, is a reg'lar visitor to our westunhome.  I like it because it has got sense.  It don't print storieswith piruts and honist young men into 'em, makin' the pirutssplendid fellers and the honist young men dis'gree'ble idiots--sothat our darters very nat'rally prefer the piruts to the honistyoung idiots; but it gives us good square American literatoor.  Thechaps that write for the "Atlantic," Betsy, understand theirbizness.  They can sling ink, they can.  I went in and saw 'em.  Itold 'em that theirs was a high and holy mission.  They seemedquite gratified, and asked me if I had seen the Grate Orgin.WHERE THE FUST BLUD WAS SPILT.I went over to Lexington yes'd'y.  My Boozum hove with sollumemotions.  "& this," I sed to a man who was drivin' a yoke of oxen,"this is where our revolutionary forefathers asserted theirindependence and spilt their Blud.  Classic ground!""Wall," the man sed, "it's good for white beans and potatoes, butwas regards raisin' wheat, t'ain't worth a damn.  But hav' you seenthe Grate Orgin?"THE POOTY GIRL IN SPECTACLES.I returned in the Hoss Cars, part way.  A pooty girl in spectaclessot near me, and was tellin' a young man how much he reminded herof a man she used to know in Walthan.  Pooty soon the young man gotout, and, smilin' in a seductive manner, I said to the girl inspectacles, "Don't _I_ remind you of somebody you used to know?""Yes," she sed, "you do remind me of one man, but he was sent tothe penitentiary for stealin' a Bar'l of mackril--he died there, soI conclood you ain't HIM."  I didn't pursoo the conversation.  Ionly heard her silvery voice once more durin' the remainder of thejerney.  Turnin' to a respectable lookin' female of advancedsummers, she asked her if she had seen the Grate Orgin.We old chaps, my dear, air apt to forget that it is sum time sincewe was infants, and et lite food.  Nothin' of further int'rist tookplace on the cars excep' a colored gen
