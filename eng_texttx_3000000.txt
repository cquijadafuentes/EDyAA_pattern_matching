Appendices I - XII                             PrefaceTHIS book is a slice of intensified history—history as I saw it. Itdoes not pretend to be anything but a detailed account of the NovemberRevolution, when the Bolsheviki, at the head of the workers andsoldiers, seized the state power of Russia and placed it in the handsof the Soviets.Naturally most of it deals with “Red Petrograd,” the capital and heartof the insurrection. But the reader must realize that what took placein Petrograd was almost exactly duplicated, with greater or lesserintensity, at different intervals of time, all over Russia.In this book, the first of several which I am writing, I must confinemyself to a chronicle of those events which I myself observed andexperienced, and those supported by reliable evidence; preceded by twochapters briefly outlining the background and causes of the NovemberRevolution. I am aware that these two chapters make difficult reading,but they are essential to an understanding of what follows.Many questions will suggest themselves to the mind of the reader. Whatis Bolshevism? What kind of a governmental structure did the Bolshevikiset up? If the Bolsheviki championed the Constituent Assembly beforethe November Revolution, why did they disperse it by force of armsafterward? And if the bourgeoisie opposed the Constituent Assemblyuntil the danger of Bolshevism became apparent, why did they championit afterward?These and many other questions cannot be answered here. In anothervolume, “Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk,” I trace the course of theRevolution up to and including the German  peace. There I explain theorigin and functions of the Revolutionary organisations, the evolutionof popular sentiment, the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, thestructure of the Soviet state, and the course and outcome of the Brest-Litovsk negotiations….In considering the rise of the Bolsheviki it is necessary to understandthat Russian economic life and the Russian army were not disorganisedon November 7th, 1917, but many months before, as the logical result ofa process which began as far back as 1915. The corrupt reactionaries incontrol of the Tsar’s Court deliberately undertook to wreck Russia inorder to make a separate peace with Germany. The lack of arms on thefront, which had caused the great retreat of the summer of 1915, thelack of food in the army and in the great cities, the break-down ofmanufactures and transportation in 1916—all these we know now were partof a gigantic campaign of sabotage. This was halted just in time by theMarch Revolution.For the first few months of the new régime, in spite of the confusionincident upon a great Revolution, when one hundred and sixty millionsof the world’s most oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty, boththe internal situation and the combative power of the army actuallyimproved.But the “honeymoon” was short. The propertied classes wanted merely apolitical revolution, which would take the power from the Tsar and giveit to them. They wanted Russia to be a constitutional Republic, likeFrance or the United States; or a constitutional Monarchy, likeEngland. On the other hand, the masses of the people wanted realindustrial and agrarian democracy.William English Walling, in his book, “Russia’s Message,” an account ofthe Revolution of 1905, describes very well the state of mind of theRussian workers, who were later to support Bolshevism almostunanimously:They (the working people) saw it was possible that even under a freeGovernment, if it fell into the hands of other social classes, theymight still continue to starve….The Russian workman is revolutionary, but he is neither violent,dogmatic, nor unintelligent. He is ready for barricades, but he hasstudied them, and alone of the workers of the world he has learnedabout them from actual experience. He is ready and willing to fight hisoppressor, the capitalist class, to a finish. But he does not ignorethe existence of other classes. He merely asks that the other classestake one side or the other in the bitter conflict that draws near….They (the workers) were all agreed that our (American) politicalinstitutions were preferable to their own, but they were not veryanxious to exchange one despot for another (i.e., the capitalistclass)….The workingmen of Russia did not have themselves shot down, executed byhundreds in Moscow, Riga and Odessa, imprisoned by thousands in everyRussian jail, and exiled to the deserts and the arctic regions, inexchange for the doubtful privileges of the workingmen of Goldfieldsand Cripple Creek….And so developed in Russia, in the midst of a foreign war, the SocialRevolution on top of the Political Revolution, culminating in thetriumph of Bolshevism.Mr. A. J. Sack, director in this country of the Russian InformationBureau, which opposes the Soviet Government, has this to say in hisbook, “The Birth of the Russian Democracy”: The Bolsheviks organisedtheir own cabinet, with Nicholas Lenine as Premier and Leon Trotsky—Minister of Foreign Affairs. The inevitability of their coming intopower became evident almost immediately after the March Revolution. Thehistory of the Bolsheviki, after the Revolution, is a history of theirsteady growth….Foreigners, and Americans especially, frequently emphasise the“ignorance” of the Russian workers. It is true they lacked thepolitical experience of the peoples of the West, but they were verywell trained in voluntary organisation. In 1917 there were more thantwelve million members of the Russian consumers’ Cooperative societies;and the Soviets themselves are a wonderful demonstration of theirorganising genius. Moreover, there is probably not a people in theworld so well educated in Socialist theory and its practicalapplication.William English Walling thus characterises them:The Russian working people are for the most part able to read andwrite. For many years the country has been in such a disturbedcondition that they have had the advantage of leadership not only ofintelligent individuals in their midst, but of a large part of theequally revolutionary educated class, who have turned to the workingpeople with their ideas for the political and social regeneration ofRussia….Many writers explain their hostility to the Soviet Government byarguing that the last phase of the Russian Revolution was simply astruggle of the “respectable” elements against the brutal attacks ofBolshevism. However, it was the propertied classes, who, when theyrealised the growth in power of the popular revolutionaryorganisations, undertook to destroy them and to halt the Revolution. Tothis end the propertied classes finally resorted to desperate measures.In order to wreck the Kerensky Ministry and the Soviets, transportationwas disorganised and internal troubles provoked; to crush the Factory-Shop Committees, plants were shut down, and fuel and raw materialsdiverted; to break the Army Committees at the front, capital punishmentwas restored and military defeat connived at.This was all excellent fuel for the Bolshevik fire. The Bolshevikiretorted by preaching the class war, and by asserting the supremacy ofthe Soviets.Between these two extremes, with the other factions which whole-heartedly or half-heartedly supported them, were the so-called“moderate” Socialists, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries,and several smaller parties. These groups were also attacked by thepropertied classes, but their power of resistance was crippled by theirtheories.Roughly, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries believed thatRussia was not economically ripe for a social revolution—that only a_political_ revolution was possible. According to their interpretation,the Russian masses were not educated enough to take over the power; anyattempt to do so would inevitably bring on a reaction, by means ofwhich some ruthless opportunist might restore the old régime. And so itfollowed that when the “moderate” Socialists were forced to assume thepower, they were afraid to use it.They believed that Russia must pass through the stages of political andeconomic development known to Western Europe, and emerge at last, withthe rest of the world, into full-fledged Socialism. Naturally,therefore, they agreed with the propertied classes that Russia mustfirst be a parliamentary state—though with some improvements on theWestern democracies. As a consequence, they insisted upon thecollaboration of the propertied classes in the Government.From this it was an easy step to supporting them. The “moderate”Socialists needed the bourgeoisie. But the bourgeoisie did not need the“moderate” Socialists. So it resulted in the Socialist Ministers beingobliged to give way, little by little, on their entire program, whilethe propertied classes grew more and more insistent.And at the end, when the Bolsheviki upset the whole hollow compromise,the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries found themselves fightingon the side of the propertied classes…. In almost every country in theworld to-day the same phenomenon is visible.Instead of being a destructive force, it seems to me that theBolsheviki were the only party in Russia with a constructive programand the power to impose it on the country. If they had not succeeded tothe Government when they did, there is little doubt in my mind that thearmies of Imperial Germany would have been in Petrograd and Moscow inDecember, and Russia would again be ridden by a Tsar….It is still fashionable, after a whole year of the Soviet Government,to speak of the Bolshevik insurrection as an “adventure.” Adventure itwas, and one of the most marvellous mankind ever embarked upon,sweeping into history at the head of the toiling masses, and stakingeverything on their vast and simple desires. Already the machinery hadbeen set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributedamong the peasants. The Factory-Shop Committees and the Trade Unionswere there to put into operation workers’ control of industry. In everyvillage, town, city, district and province there were Soviets ofWorkers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, prepared to assume the taskof local administration.No matter what one thinks of Bolshevism, it is undeniable that theRussian Revolution is one of the great events of human history, and therise of the Bolsheviki a phenomenon of world-wide importance. Just ashistorians search the records for the minutest details of the story ofthe Paris Commune, so they will want to know what happened in Petrogradin November, 1917, the spirit which animated the people, and how theleaders looked, talked and acted. It is with this in view that I havewritten this book.In the struggle my sympathies were not neutral. But in telling thestory of those great days I have tried to see events with the eye of aconscientious reporter, interested in setting down the truth.                                        J. R.    New York, January 1st 1919.                        Notes and ExplanationsTo the average reader the multiplicity of Russianorganisations-political groups, Committees and Central Committees,Soviets, Dumas and Unions-will prove extremely confusing. For thisreason I am giving here a few brief definitions and explanations.                        Political PartiesIn the elections to the Constituent Assembly, there were seventeentickets in Petrograd, and in some of the provincial towns as many asforty; but the following summary of the aims and composition ofpolitical parties is limited to the groups and factions mentioned inthis book. Only the essence of their programmes and the generalcharacter of their constituencies can be noticed....  1. _Monarchists,_ of various shades, _Octobrists,_ etc. Theseonce-powerful factions no longer existed openly; they either workedunderground, or their members joined the _Cadets,_ as the _Cadets_came by degrees to stand for their political programme.Representatives in this book, Rodzianko, Shulgin.  2. _Cadets._ So-called from the initials of its name,Constitutional Democrats. Its official name is "Party of the People'sFreedom." Under the Tsar composed of Liberals from the propertiedclasses, the _Cadets_ were the great party of _political_ reform,roughly corresponding to the Progressive Party in America. When theRevolution broke out in March, 1917, the _Cadets_ formed the firstProvisional Government. The _Cadet_ Ministry was overthrown in Aprilbecause it declared itself in favour of Allied imperialistic aims,including the imperialistic aims of the Tsar's Government. As theRevolution became more and more a _social economic_ Revolution, the_Cadets_ grew more and more conservative. Its representatives in thisbook are: Miliukov, Vinaver, Shatsky.  2a. _Group of Public Men._ After the _Cadets_ had become unpopularthrough their relations with the Kornilov counter-revolution, the_Group of Public Men_ was formed in Moscow. Delegates from the _Groupof Public Men_ were given portfolios in the last Kerensky Cabinet.The _Group_ declared itself non-partisan, although its intellectualleaders were men like Rodzianko and Shulgin. It was composed of themore "modern" bankers, merchants and manufacturers, who wereintelligent enough to realise that the Soviets must be fought bytheir own weapon-economic organisation. Typical of the _Group:_Lianozov, Konovalov.  3. _Populist Socialists,_ or _Trudoviki_ (Labour Group).Numerically a small party, composed of cautious intellectuals, theleaders of the Cooperative societies, and conservative peasants.Professing to be Socialists, the _Populists_ really supported theinterests of the petty bourgeoisie-clerks, shopkeepers, etc. Bydirect descent, inheritors of the compromising tradition of theLabour Group in the Fourth Imperial Duma, which was composed largelyof peasant representatives. Kerensky was the leader of the_Trudoviki_ in the Imperial Duma when the Revolution of March, 1917,broke out. The _Populist Socialists_ are a nationalistic party. Theirrepresentatives in this book are: Peshekhanov, Tchaikovsky.  4. _Russian Social Democratic Labour Party._ Originally MarxianSocialists. At a party congress held in 1903, the party split, on thequestion of tactics, into two factions-the Majority (Bolshinstvo),and the Minority (Menshinstvo). From this sprang the names"Bolsheviki" and "Mensheviki"-"members of the majority" and "membersof the minority." These two wings became two separate parties, bothcalling themselves "Russian Social Democratic Labour Party," and bothprofessing to be Marxians. Since the Revolution of 1905 theBolsheviki were really the minority, becoming again the majority inSeptember, 1917.  a. _Mensheviki._ This party includes all shades of Socialists whobelieve that society must progress by natural evolution towardSocialism, and that the working-class must conquer political powerfirst. Also a nationalistic party. This was the party of theSocialist intellectuals, which means: all the means of educationhaving been in the hands of the propertied classes, the intellectualsinstinctively reacted to their training, and took the side of thepropertied classes. Among their representatives in this book are:Dan, Lieber, Tseretelli.  b. _Mensheviki Internationalists._ The radical wing of the_Mensheviki,_ internationalists and opposed to all coalition with thepropertied classes; yet unwilling to break loose from theconservative Mensheviki, and opposed to the dictatorship of theworking-class advocated by the Bolsheviki. Trotzky was long a memberof this group. Among their leaders: Martov, Martinov.  c. _Bolsheviki._ Now call themselves the _Communist Party,_ inorder to emphasise their complete separation from the tradition of"moderate" or "parliamentary" Socialism, which dominates theMensheviki and the so-called Majority Socialists in all countries.The _Bolsheviki_ proposed immediate proletarian insurrection, andseizure of the reins of Government, in order to hasten the coming ofSocialism by forcibly taking over industry, land, natural resourcesand financial institutions. This party expresses the desires chieflyof the factory workers, but also of a large section of the poorpeasants. The name "Bolshevik" can _not_ be translated by"Maximalist." The Maximalists are a separate group. (See paragraph5b). Among the leaders: Lenin, Trotzky, Lunatcharsky.  d. _United Social Democrats Internationalists._ Also called the_Novaya Zhizn_ (New Life) group, from the name of the veryinfluential newspaper which was its organ. A little group ofintellectuals with a very small following among the working-class,except the personal following of Maxim Gorky, its leader.Intellectuals, with almost the same programme as the _MenshevikiInternationalists,_ except that the _Novaya Zhizn_ group refused tobe tied to either of the two great factions. Opposed the Bolsheviktactics, but remained in the Soviet Government. Other representativesin this book: Avilov, Kramarov.  e. _Yedinstvo._ A very small and dwindling group, composed almostentirely of the personal following of Plekhanov, one of the pioneersof the Russian Social Democratic movement in the 80's, and itsgreatest theoretician. Now an old man, Plekhanov was extremelypatriotic, too conservative even for the Mensheviki. After theBolshevik _coup d'etat, Yedinstvo_ disappeared.  5. _Socialist Revolutionary party._ Called _Essaires_ from theinitials of their name. Originally the revolutionary party of thepeasants, the party of the Fighting Organisations-the Terrorists.After the March Revolution, it was joined by many who had never beenSocialists. At that time it stood for the abolition of privateproperty in land only, the owners to be compensated in some fashion.Finally the increasing revolutionary feeling of peasants forced the_Essaires_ to abandon the "compensation" clause, and led to theyounger and more fiery intellectuals breaking off from the main partyin the fall of 1917 and forming a new party, the _Left SocialistRevolutionary party._ The _Essaires,_ who were afterward alwayscalled by the radical groups _"Right Socialist Revolutionaries,"_adopted the political attitude of the Mensheviki, and worked togetherwith them. They finally came to represent the wealthier peasants, theintellectuals, and the politically uneducated populations of remoterural districts. Among them there was, however, a wider difference ofshades of political and economic opinion than among the Mensheviki.Among their leaders mentioned in these pages: Avksentiev, Gotz,Kerensky, Tchernov, "Babuschka" Breshkovskaya.  a. _Left Socialist Revolutionaries._ Although theoretically sharingthe Bolshevik programme of dictatorship of the working-class, atfirst were reluctant to follow the ruthless Bolshevik tactics.However, the _Left Socialist Revolutionaries_ remained in the SovietGovernment, sharing the Cabinet portfolios, especially that ofAgriculture. They withdrew from the Government several times, butalways returned. As the peasants left the ranks of the _Essaires_ inincreasing numbers, they joined the _Left Socialist Revolutionaryparty,_ which became the great peasant party supporting the SovietGovernment, standing for confiscation without compensation of thegreat landed estates, and their disposition by the peasantsthemselves. Among the leaders: Spiridonova, Karelin, Kamkov,Kalagayev.  b. _Maximalists._ An off-shoot of the _Socialist Revolutionaryparty_ in the Revolution of 1905, when it was a powerful peasantmovement, demanding the immediate application of the maximumSocialist programme. Now an insignificant group of peasantanarchists.                        Parliamentary ProcedureRussian meetings and conventions are organised after the continentalmodel rather than our own. The first action is usually the electionof officers and the _presidium._  The _presidium_ is a presiding committee, composed ofrepresentatives of the groups and political factions represented inthe assembly, in proportion to their numbers. The _presidium_arranges the Order of Business, and its members can be called upon bythe President to take the chair _pro tem._  Each question (_vopros_) is stated in a general way and thendebated, and at the close of the debate resolutions are submitted bythe different factions, and each one voted on separately. The Orderof Business can be, and usually is, smashed to pieces in the firsthalf hour. On the plea of "emergency," which the crowd almost alwaysgrants, anybody from the floor can get up and say anything on anysubject. The crowd controls the meeting, practically the onlyfunctions of the speaker being to keep order by ringing a littlebell, and to recognise speakers. Almost all the real work of thesession is done in caucuses of the different groups and politicalfactions, which almost always cast their votes in a body and arerepresented by floor-leaders. The result is, however, that at everyimportant new point, or vote, the session takes a recess to enablethe different groups and political factions to hold a caucus.  The crowd is extremely noisy, cheering or heckling speakers,over-riding the plans of the _presidium._ Among the customary criesare: _"Prosim!_ Please! Go on!" _"Pravilno!"_ or _"Eto vierno!_That's true! Right!" _"Do volno!_ Enough!" _"Doloi!_ Down with him!"_"Posor!_ Shame!" and _"Teesche!_ Silence! Not so noisy!"                        Popular Organisations1. _Soviet._ The word _soviet_ means "council." Under the Tsar theImperial Council of State was called _Gosudarstvennyi Soviet._ Sincethe Revolution, however, the term _Soviet_ has come to be associatedwith a certain type of parliament elected by members of working-classeconomic organisations-the Soviet of Workers', of Soldiers', or ofPeasants' Deputies. I have therefore limited the word to thesebodies, and wherever else it occurs I have translated it "Council."  Besides the local _Soviets,_ elected in every city, town andvillage of Russia-and in large cities, also Ward _(Raionny)Soviets_-there are also the _oblastne_ or _gubiernsky_ (district orprovincial) _Soviets,_ and the Central Executive Committee of theAll-Russian _Soviets_ in the capital, called from its initials_Tsay-ee-kah._ (See below, "Central Committees").  Almost everywhere the _Soviets_ of Workers' and of Soldiers'Deputies combined very soon after the March Revolution. In specialmatters concerning their peculiar interests, however, the Workers'and the Soldiers' Sections continued to meet separately. The_Soviets_ of Peasants' Deputies did not join the other two untilafter the Bolshevik _coup d'etat._ They, too, were organised like theworkers and soldiers, with an Executive Committee of the All-RussianPeasants' _Soviets_ in the capital.  2. _Trade Unions._ Although mostly industrial in form, the Russianlabour unions were still called Trade Unions, and at the time of theBolshevik Revolution had from three to four million members. TheseUnions were also organised in an All-Russian body, a sort of RussianFederation of Labour, which had its Central Executive Committee inthe capital.  3. _Factory-Shop Committees._ These were spontaneous organisationscreated in the factories by the workers in their attempt to controlindustry, taking advantage of the administrative break-down incidentupon the Revolution. Their function was by revolutionary action totake over and run the factories. The _Factory-Shop Committees_ alsohad their All-Russian organisation, with a Central Committee atPetrograd, which co-operated with the Trade Unions.  4. _Dumas._ The word _duma_ means roughly "deliberative body." Theold Imperial Duma, which persisted six months after the Revolution,in a democratised form, died a natural death in September, 1917. The_City Duma_ referred to in this book was the reorganised MunicipalCouncil, often called "Municipal Self-Government." It was elected bydirect and secret ballot, and its only reason for failure to hold themasses during the Bolshevik Revolution was the general decline ininfluence of all purely _political_ representation in the fact of thegrowing power of organisations based on _economic_ groups.  5. _Zemstvos._ May be roughly translated "county councils." Underthe Tsar semi-political, semi-social bodies with very littleadministrative power, developed and controlled largely byintellectual Liberals among the land-owning classes. Their mostimportant function was education and social service among thepeasants. During the war the _Zemstvos_ gradually took over theentire feeding and clothing of the Russian Army, as well as thebuying from foreign countries, and work among the soldiers generallycorresponding to the work of the American Y. M. C. A. at the Front.After the March Revolution the _Zemstvos_ were democratized, with aview to making them the organs of local government in the ruraldistricts. But like the _City Dumas,_ they could not compete with the_Soviets._  6. _Cooperatives._ These were the workers' and peasants' Consumers'Cooperative societies, which had several million members all overRussia before the Revolution. Founded by Liberals and "moderate"Socialists, the Cooperative movement was not supported by therevolutionary Socialist groups, because it was a substitute for thecomplete transference of means of production and distribution intothe hands of the workers. After the March Revolution the_Cooperatives_ spread rapidly, and were dominated by PopulistSocialists, Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, and acted as aconservative political force until the Bolshevik Revolution. However,it was the _Cooperatives_ which fed Russia when the old structure ofcommerce and transportation collapsed.  7. _Army Committees._ The _Army Committees_ were formed by thesoldiers at the front to combat the reactionary influence of the oldregime officers. Every company, regiment, brigade, division and corpshad its committee, over all of which was elected the _ArmyCommittee._ The _Central Army Committee_ cooperated with the GeneralStaff. The administrative break-down in the army incident upon theRevolution threw upon the shoulders of the _Army Committees_ most ofthe work of the Quartermaster's Department, and in some cases, eventhe command of troops.  8. _Fleet Committees._ The corresponding organisations in the Navy.                        Central CommitteesIn the spring and summer of 1917, All-Russian conventions of everysort of organisation were held at Petrograd. There were nationalcongresses of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Soviets, TradeUnions, Factory-Shop Committees, Army and Fleet Committees-besidesevery branch of the military and naval service, Cooperatives,Nationalities, etc. Each of these conventions elected a CentralCommittee, or a Central Executive Committee, to guard its particularinterests at the seat of Government. As the Provisional Governmentgrew weaker, these Central Committees were forced to assume more andmore administrative powers.  The most important Central Committees mentioned in this book are:  _Union of Unions._ During the Revolution of 1905, ProfessorMiliukov and other Liberals established unions of professionalmen-doctors, lawyers, physicians, etc. These were united under onecentral organisation, the _Union of Unions._ In 1905 the _Union ofUnions_ acted with the revolutionary democracy; in 1917, however, the_Union of Unions_ opposed the Bolshevik uprising, and united theGovernment employees who went on strike against the authority of theSoviets.  _Tsay-ee-kah._ All-Russian Central Executive Committee of theSoviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. So called from theinitials of its name.  _Tsentroflot._ "Centre-Fleet"-the Central Fleet Committee.  _Vikzhel._ All-Russian Central Committee of the Railway Workers'Union. So called from the initials of its name.                        Other Organisations_Red Guards._ The armed factory workers of Russia. The _Red Guards_were first formed during the Revolution of 1905, and sprang intoexistence again in the days of March, 1917, when a force was neededto keep order in the city. At that time they were armed, and allefforts of the Provisional Government to disarm them were more orless unsuccessful. At every great crisis in the Revolution the _RedGuards_ appeared on the streets, untrained and undisciplined, butfull of Revolutionary zeal.  _White Guards._ Bourgeois volunteers, who emerged in the laststages of the Revolution, to defend private property from theBolshevik attempt to abolish it. A great many of them were Universitystudents.  _Tekhintsi._ The so-called "Savage Division" in the army, made upof Mohametan tribesmen from Central Asia, and personally devoted toGeneral Kornilov. The _Tekhintsi_ were noted for their blindobedience and their savage cruelty in warfare.  _Death Battalions._ Or _Shock Battalions._ The Women's Battalion isknown to the world as the _Death Battalion,_ but there were many_Death Battalions_ composed of men. These were formed in the summerof 1917 by Kerensky, for the purpose of strengthening the disciplineand combative fire of the army by heroic example. The _DeathBattalions_ were composed mostly of intense young patriots. Thesecame for the most part from among the sons of the propertied classes.  _Union of Officers._ An organisation formed among the reactionaryofficers in the army to combat politically the growing power of theArmy Committees.  _Knights of St. George._ The Cross of St. George was awarded fordistinguished action in battle. Its holder automatically became a_"Knight of St. George."_ The predominant influence in theorganisation was that of the supporters of the military idea.  _Peasants' Union._ In 1905, the _Peasants' Union_ was arevolutionary peasants' organisation. In 1917, however, it had becomethe political expression of the more prosperous peasants, to fightthe growing power and revolutionary aims of the Soviets of Peasants'Deputies.                        Chronology and SpellingI have adopted in this book our Calendar throughout, instead of theformer Russian Calendar, which was thirteen days earlier.  In the spelling of Russian names and words, I have made no attemptto follow any scientific rules for transliteration, but have tried togive the spelling which would lead the English-speaking reader to thesimplest approximation of their pronunciation.                        SourcesMuch of the material in this book is from my own notes. I have alsorelied, however, upon a heterogeneous file of several hundredassorted Russian newspapers, covering almost every day of the timedescribed, of files of the English paper, the _Russian Daily News,_and of the two French papers, _Journal de Russie_ and _Entente._ Butfar more valuable than these is the _Bulletin de la Presse_ issueddaily by the French Information Bureau in Petrograd, which reportsall important happenings, speeches and the comment of the Russianpress. Of this I have an almost complete file from the spring of 1917to the end of January, 1918.  Besides the foregoing, I have in my possession almost everyproclamation, decree and announcement posted on the walls ofPetrograd from the middle of September, 1917, to the end of January,1918. Also the official publication of all Government decrees andorders, and the official Government publication of the secrettreaties and other documents discovered in the Ministry of ForeignAffairs when the Bolsheviki took it over.                  Ten Days That Shook The World                              Chapter I                             BackgroundTOWARD the end of September, 1917, an alien Professor of Sociologyvisiting Russia came to see me in Petrograd. He had been informed bybusiness men and intellectuals that the Revolution was slowing down.The Professor wrote an article about it, and then travelled aroundthe country, visiting factory towns and peasant communities-where, tohis astonishment, the Revolution seemed to be speeding up. Among thewage-earners and the land-working people it was common to hear talkof "all land to the peasants, all factories to the workers." If theProfessor had visited the front, he would have heard the whole Armytalking Peace....The Professor was puzzled, but he need not have been; bothobservations were correct. The property-owning classes were becomingmore conservative, the masses of the people more radical.There was a feeling among business men and the _intelligentzia_generally that the Revolution had gone quite far enough, and lastedtoo long; that things should settle down. This sentiment was sharedby the dominant "moderate" Socialist groups, the _oborontsi_ (SeeApp. I, Sect. 1) Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, whosupported the Provisional Government of Kerensky.On October 14th the official organ of the "moderate" Socialists said:The drama of Revolution has two acts; the destruction of the oldrégime and the creation of the new one. The first act has lasted longenough. Now it is time to go on to the second, and to play it asrapidly as possible. As a great revolutionist put it, "Let us hasten,friends, to terminate the Revolution. He who makes it last too longwill not gather the fruits...."Among the worker, soldier and peasant masses, however, there was astubborn feeling that the "first act" was not yet played out. On thefront the Army Committees were always running foul of officers whocould not get used to treating their men like human beings; in therear the Land Committees elected by the peasants were being jailedfor trying to carry out Government regulations concerning the land;and the workmen (See App. I, Sect. 2) in the factories were fightingblack-lists and lockouts. Nay, furthermore, returning politicalexiles were being excluded from the country as "undesirable"citizens; and in some cases, men who returned from abroad to theirvillages were prosecuted and imprisoned for revolutionary actscommitted in 1905.To the multiform discontent of the people the "moderate" Socialistshad one answer: Wait for the Constituent Assembly, which is to meetin December. But the masses were not satisfied with that. TheConstituent Assembly was all well and good; but there were certaindefinite things for which the Russian Revolution had been made, andfor which the revolutionary martyrs rotted in their stark BrotherhoodGrave on Mars Field, that must be achieved Constituent Assembly or noConstituent Assembly: Peace, Land, and Workers' Control of Industry.The Constituent Assembly had been postponed and postponed-wouldprobably be postponed again, until the people were calmenough-perhaps to modify their demands! At any rate, here were eightmonths of the Revolution gone, and little enough to show for it....Meanwhile the soldiers began to solve the peace question by simplydeserting, the peasants burned manor-houses and took over the greatestates, the workers sabotaged and struck.... Of course, as wasnatural, the manufacturers, land-owners and army officers exerted alltheir influence against any democratic compromise....The policy of the Provisional Government alternated betweenineffective reforms and stern repressive measures. An edict from theSocialist Minister of Labour ordered all the Workers' Committeeshenceforth to meet only after working hours. Among the troops at thefront, "agitators" of opposition political parties were arrested,radical newspapers closed down, and capital punishment applied-torevolutionary propagandists. Attempts were made to disarm the RedGuard. Cossacks were sent to keep order in the provinces....These measures were supported by the "moderate" Socialists and theirleaders in the Ministry, who considered it necessary to cooperatewith the propertied classes. The people rapidly deserted them, andwent over to the Bolsheviki, who stood for Peace, Land, and Workers'Control of Industry, and a Government of the working-class. InSeptember, 1917, matters reached a crisis. Against the overwhelmingsentiment of the country, Kerensky and the "moderate" Socialistssucceeded in establishing a Government of Coalition with thepropertied classes; and as a result, the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries lost the confidence of the people forever.An article in _Rabotchi Put_ (Workers' Way) about the middle ofOctober, entitled "The Socialist Ministers," expressed the feeling ofthe masses of the people against the "moderate" Socialists:Here is a list of their services.(See App. I, Sect. 3)Tseretelli: disarmed the workmen with the assistance of GeneralPolovtsev, checkmated the revolutionary soldiers, and approved ofcapital punishment in the army.Skobeliev: commenced by trying to tax the capitalists 100% of theirprofits, and finished-and finished by an attempt to dissolve theWorkers' Committees in the shops and factories.Avksentiev: put several hundred peasants in prison, members of theLand Committees, and suppressed dozens of workers' and soldiers'newspapers.Tchernov: signed the "Imperial" manifest, ordering the dissolution ofthe Finnish Diet.Savinkov: concluded an open alliance with General Kornilov. If thissaviour of the country was not able to betray Petrograd, it was dueto reasons over which he had no control.Zarudny: with the sanction of Alexinsky and Kerensky, put some of thebest workers of the Revolution, soldiers and sailors, in prison.Nikitin: acted as a vulgar policeman against the Railway Workers.Kerensky: it is better not to say anything about him. The list of hisservices is too long....A Congress of delegates of the Baltic Fleet, at Helsingfors, passed aresolution which began as follows:We demand the immediate removal from the ranks of the ProvisionalGovernment of the "Socialist," the political adventurer-Kerensky, asone who is scandalising and ruining the great Revolution, and with itthe revolutionary masses, by his shameless political blackmail onbehalf of the bourgeoisie....The direct result of all this was the rise of the Bolsheviki....Since March, 1917, when the roaring torrents of workmen and soldiersbeating upon the Tauride Palace compelled the reluctant Imperial Dumato assume the supreme power in Russia, it was the masses of thepeople, workers, soldiers and peasants, which forced every change inthe course of the Revolution. They hurled the Miliukov Ministry down;it was their Soviet which proclaimed to the world the Russian peaceterms-"No annexations, no indemnities, and the right ofself-determination of peoples"; and again, in July, it was thespontaneous rising of the unorganised proletariat which once morestormed the Tauride Palace, to demand that the Soviets take over theGovernment of Russia.The Bolsheviki, then a small political sect, put themselves at thehead of the movement. As a result of the disastrous failure of therising, public opinion turned against them, and their leaderlesshordes slunk back into the Viborg Quarter, which is Petrograd's _St.Antoine._ Then followed a savage hunt of the Bolsheviki; hundredswere imprisoned, among them Trotzky, Madame Kollontai and Kameniev;Lenin and Zinoviev went into hiding, fugitives from justice; theBolshevik papers were suppressed. Provocators and reactionariesraised the cry that the Bolsheviki were German agents, until peopleall over the world believed it.But the Provisional Government found itself unable to substantiateits accusations; the documents proving pro-German conspiracy werediscovered to be forgeries; [*] and one by one the Bolsheviki were[*Part of the famous "Sisson Documents"]released from prison without trial, on nominal or no bail-until onlysix remained. The impotence and indecision of the ever-changingProvisional Government was an argument nobody could refute. TheBolsheviki raised again the slogan so dear to the masses, "All Powerto the Soviets!"-and they were not merely self-seeking, for at thattime the majority of the Soviets was "moderate" Socialist, theirbitter enemy.But more potent still, they took the crude, simple desires of theworkers, soldiers and peasants, and from them built their immediateprogramme. And so, while the _oborontsi_ Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries involved themselves in compromise with thebourgeoisie, the Bolsheviki rapidly captured the Russian masses. InJuly they were hunted and despised; by September the metropolitanworkmen, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet, and the soldiers, had beenwon almost entirely to their cause. The September municipal electionsin the large cities (See App. I, Sect. 4) were significant; only 18per cent of the returns were Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary,against more than 70 per cent in June....There remains a phenomenon which puzzled foreign observers: the factthat the Central Executive Committees of the Soviets, the CentralArmy and Fleet Committees, [*] and the Central Committees of some of[*See Notes and Explanations.]the Unions-notably, the Post and Telegraph Workers and the RailwayWorkers-opposed the Bolsheviki with the utmost violence. TheseCentral Committees had all been elected in the middle of the summer,or even before, when the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries hadan enormous following; and they delayed or prevented any newelections. Thus, according to the constitution of the Soviets ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies, the All-Russian Congress _shouldhave been called in September;_ but the _Tsay-ee-kah_ [*] would not[*See Notes and Explanations.]call the meeting, on the ground that the Constituent Assembly wasonly two months away, at which time, they hinted, the Soviets wouldabdicate. Meanwhile, one by one, the Bolsheviki were winning in thelocal Soviets all over the country, in the Union branches and theranks of the soldiers and sailors. The Peasants' Soviets remainedstill conservative, because in the sluggish rural districts politicalconsciousness developed slowly, and the Socialist Revolutionary partyhad been for a generation the party which had agitated among thepeasants.... But even among the peasants a revolutionary wing wasforming. It showed itself clearly in October, when the left wing ofthe Socialist Revolutionaries split off, and formed a new politicalfaction, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries.At the same time there were signs everywhere that the forces ofreaction were gaining confidence.(See App. I, Sect. 5) At theTroitsky Farce theatre in Petrograd, for example, a burlesque called_Sins of the Tsar_ was interrupted by a group of Monarchists, whothreatened to lynch the actors for "insulting the Emperor." Certainnewspapers began to sigh for a "Russian Napoleon." It was the usualthing among bourgeois _intelligentzia_ to refer to the Soviets ofWorkers' Deputies (Rabotchikh Deputatov) as _Sabatchikh_Deputatov-Dogs' Deputies.On October 15th I had a conversation with a great Russian capitalist,Stepan Georgevitch Lianozov, known as the "Russian Rockefeller"-aCadet by political faith."Revolution," he said, "is a sickness. Sooner or later the foreignpowers must intervene here-as one would intervene to cure a sickchild, and teach it how to walk. Of course it would be more or lessimproper, but the nations must realise the danger of Bolshevism intheir own countries-such contagious ideas as 'proletariandictatorship,' and 'world social revolution'... There is a chance thatthis intervention may not be necessary. Transportation isdemoralised, the factories are closing down, and the Germans areadvancing. Starvation and defeat may bring the Russian people totheir senses...."Mr. Lianozov was emphatic in his opinion that whatever happened, itwould be impossible for merchants and manufacturers to permit theexistence of the workers' Shop Committees, or to allow the workersany share in the management of industry."As for the Bolsheviki, they will be done away with by one of twomethods. The Government can evacuate Petrograd, then a state of siegedeclared, and the military commander of the district can deal withthese gentlemen without legal formalities.... _Or if, for example, theConstituent Assembly manifests any Utopian tendencies, it can bedispersed by force of arms...."_Winter was coming on-the terrible Russian winter. I heard businessmen speak of it so: "Winter was always Russia's best friend. Perhapsnow it will rid us of Revolution." On the freezing front miserablearmies continued to starve and die, without enthusiasm. The railwayswere breaking down, food lessening, factories closing. The desperatemasses cried out that the bourgeoisie was sabotaging the life of thepeople, causing defeat on the Front. Riga had been surrendered justafter General Kornilov said publicly, "Must we pay with Riga theprice of bringing the country to a sense of its duty?" [*][* See "Kornilov to Brest-Litvosk" by John Reed. Boni and LiverightN.Y., 1919]To Americans it is incredible that the class war should develop tosuch a pitch. But I have personally met officers on the NorthernFront who frankly preferred military disaster to cooperation with theSoldiers' Committees. The secretary of the Petrograd branch of theCadet party told me that the break-down of the country's economiclife was part of a campaign to discredit the Revolution. An Allieddiplomat, whose name I promised not to mention, confirmed this fromhis own knowledge. I know of certain coal-mines near Kharkov whichwere fired and flooded by their owners, of textile factories atMoscow whose engineers put the machinery out of order when they left,of railroad officials caught by the workers in the act of cripplinglocomotives....A large section of the propertied classes preferred the Germans tothe Revolution-even to the Provisional Government-and didn't hesitateto say so. In the Russian household where I lived, the subject ofconversation at the dinner table was almost invariably the coming ofthe Germans, bringing "law and order."... One evening I spent at thehouse of a Moscow merchant; during tea we asked the eleven people atthe table whether they preferred "Wilhelm or the Bolsheviki." Thevote was ten to one for Wilhelm...The speculators took advantage of the universal disorganisation topile up fortunes, and to spend them in fantastic revelry or thecorruption of Government officials. Foodstuffs and fuel were hoarded,or secretly sent out of the country to Sweden. In the first fourmonths of the Revolution, for example, the reserve food-supplies werealmost openly looted from the great Municipal warehouses ofPetrograd, until the two-years' provision of grain had fallen to lessthan enough to feed the city for one month.... According to theofficial report of the last Minister of Supplies in the ProvisionalGovernment, coffee was bought wholesale in Vladivostok for two rublesa pound, and the consumer in Petrograd paid thirteen. In all thestores of the large cities were tons of food and clothing; but onlythe rich could buy them.In a provincial town I knew a merchant family turnedspeculator_-maradior_ (bandit, ghoul) the Russians call it. The threesons had bribed their way out of military service. One gambled infoodstuffs. Another sold illegal gold from the Lena mines tomysterious parties in Finland. The third owned a controlling interestin a chocolate factory, which supplied the local Cooperativesocieties-on condition that the Cooperatives furnished him everythinghe needed. And so, while the masses of the people got a quarter poundof black bread on their bread cards, he had an abundance of whitebread, sugar, tea, candy, cake and butter.... Yet when the soldiers atthe front could no longer fight from cold, hunger and exhaustion, howindignantly did this family scream "Cowards!"-how "ashamed" they were"to be Russians"... When finally the Bolsheviki found and requisitionedvast hoarded stores of provisions, what "Robbers" they were.Beneath all this external rottenness moved the old-time Dark Forces,unchanged since the fall of Nicholas the Second, secret still andvery active. The agents of the notorious _Okhrana_ still functioned,for and against the Tsar, for and against Kerensky-whoever wouldpay.... In the darkness, underground organisations of all sorts, suchas the Black Hundreds, were busy attempting to restore reaction insome form or other.In this atmosphere of corruption, of monstrous half-truths, one clearnote sounded day after day, the deepening chorus of the Bolsheviki,"All Power to the Soviets! All power to the direct representatives ofmillions on millions of common workers, soldiers, peasants. Land,bread, an end to the senseless war, an end to secret diplomacy,speculation, treachery.... The Revolution is in danger, and with it thecause of the people all over the world!"The struggle between the proletariat and the middle class, betweenthe Soviets and the Government, which had begun in the first Marchdays, was about to culminate. Having at one bound leaped from theMiddle Ages into the twentieth century, Russia showed the startledworld two systems of Revolution-the political and the social-inmortal combat.What a revelation of the vitality of the Russian Revolution, afterall these months of starvation and disillusionment! The bourgeoisieshould have better known its Russia. Not for a long time in Russiawill the "sickness" of Revolution have run its course....Looking back, Russia before the November insurrection seems ofanother age, almost incredibly conservative. So quickly did we adaptourselves to the newer, swifter life; just as Russian politics swungbodily to the Left-until the Cadets were outlawed as "enemies of thepeople," Kerensky became a "counter-revolutionist," the "middle"Socialist leaders, Tseretelli, Dan, Lieber, Gotz and Avksentiev, weretoo reactionary for their following, and men like Victor Tchernov,and even Maxim Gorky, belonged to the Right Wing....About the middle of December, 1917, a group of SocialistRevolutionary leaders paid a private visit to Sir George Buchanan,the British Ambassador, and implored him not to mention the fact thatthey had been there, because they were "considered too far Right.""And to think," said Sir George. "One year ago my Governmentinstructed me not to receive Miliukov, because he was so dangerouslyLeft!"September and October are the worst months of the Russianyear-especially the Petrograd year. Under dull grey skies, in theshortening days, the rain fell drenching, incessant. The mudunderfoot was deep, slippery and clinging, tracked everywhere byheavy boots, and worse than usual because of the complete break-downof the Municipal administration. Bitter damp winds rushed in from theGulf of Finland, and the chill fog rolled through the streets. Atnight, for motives of economy as well as fear of Zeppelins, thestreet-lights were few and far between; in private dwellings andapartment-houses the electricity was turned on from six o'clock untilmidnight, with candles forty cents apiece and little kerosene to behad. It was dark from three in the afternoon to ten in the morning.Robberies and housebreakings increased. In apartment houses the mentook turns at all-night guard duty, armed with loaded rifles. Thiswas under the Provisional Government.Week by week food became scarcer. The daily allowance of bread fellfrom a pound and a half to a pound, then three quarters, half, and aquarter-pound. Toward the end there was a week without any bread atall. Sugar one was entitled to at the rate of two pounds a month-ifone could get it at all, which was seldom. A bar of chocolate or apound of tasteless candy cost anywhere from seven to ten rubles-atleast a dollar. There was milk for about half the babies in the city;most hotels and private houses never saw it for months. In the fruitseason apples and pears sold for a little less than a ruble apiece onthe street-corner....For milk and bread and sugar and tobacco one had to stand in _queue_long hours in the chill rain. Coming home from an all-night meeting Ihave seen the _kvost_ (tail) beginning to form before dawn, mostlywomen, some with babies in their arms.... Carlyle, in his _FrenchRevolution,_ has described the French people as distinguished aboveall others by their faculty of standing in _queue._ Russia hadaccustomed herself to the practice, begun in the reign of Nicholasthe Blessed as long ago as 1915, and from then continuedintermittently until the summer of 1917, when it settled down as theregular order of things. Think of the poorly-clad people standing onthe iron-white streets of Petrograd whole days in the Russian winter!I have listened in the bread-lines, hearing the bitter, acrid note ofdiscontent which from time to time burst up through the miraculousgoodnature of the Russian crowd....Of course all the theatres were going every night, including Sundays.Karsavina appeared in a new Ballet at the Marinsky, all dance-lovingRussia coming to see her. Shaliapin was singing. At the Alexandrinskythey were reviving Meyerhold's production of Tolstoy's "Death of Ivanthe Terrible"; and at that performance I remember noticing a studentof the Imperial School of Pages, in his dress uniform, who stood upcorrectly between the acts and faced the empty Imperial box, with itseagles all erased.... The _Krivoye Zerkalo_ staged a sumptuous versionof Schnitzler's "Reigen."Although the Hermitage and other picture galleries had been evacuatedto Moscow, there were weekly exhibitions of paintings. Hordes of thefemale _intelligentzia_ went to hear lectures on Art, Literature andthe Easy Philosophies. It was a particularly active season forTheosophists. And the Salvation Army, admitted to Russia for thefirst time in history, plastered the walls with announcements ofgospel meetings, which amused and astounded Russian audiences....As in all such times, the petty conventional life of the city wenton, ignoring the Revolution as much as possible. The poets madeverses-but not about the Revolution. The realistic painters paintedscenes from mediæval Russian history-anything but the Revolution.Young ladies from the provinces came up to the capital to learnFrench and cultivate their voices, and the gay young beautifulofficers wore their gold-trimmed crimson _bashliki_ and theirelaborate Caucasian swords around the hotel lobbies. The ladies ofthe minor bureaucratic set took tea with each other in the afternoon,carrying each her little gold or silver or jewelled sugar-box, andhalf a loaf of bread in her muff, and wished that the Tsar were back,or that the Germans would come, or anything that would solve theservant problem.... The daughter of a friend of mine came home oneafternoon in hysterics because the woman street-car conductor hadcalled her "Comrade!"All around them great Russia was in travail, bearing a new world. Theservants one used to treat like animals and pay next to nothing, weregetting independent. A pair of shoes cost more than a hundred rubles,and as wages averaged about thirty-five rubles a month the servantsrefused to stand in _queue_ and wear out their shoes. But more thanthat. In the new Russia every man and woman could vote; there wereworking-class newspapers, saying new and startling things; there werethe Soviets; and there were the Unions. The _izvoshtchiki_(cab-drivers) had a Union; they were also represented in thePetrograd Soviet. The waiters and hotel servants were organised, andrefused tips. On the walls of restaurants they put up signs whichread, "No tips taken here-" or, "Just because a man has to make hisliving waiting on table is no reason to insult him by offering him atip!"At the Front the soldiers fought out their fight with the officers,and learned self-government through their committees. In thefactories those unique Russian organisations, the Factory-ShopCommittees, [*] gained experience and strength and a realisation of[* See Notes and Explanations]their historical mission by combat with the old order. All Russia waslearning to read, and _reading-_politics, economics, history-becausethe people wanted to _know...._ In every city, in most towns, along theFront, each political faction had its newspaper-sometimes several.Hundreds of thousands of pamphlets were distributed by thousands oforganisations, and poured into the armies, the villages, thefactories, the streets. The thirst for education, so long thwarted,burst with the Revolution into a frenzy of expression. From SmolnyInstitute alone, the first six months, went out every day tons,car-loads, train-loads of literature, saturating the land. Russiaabsorbed reading matter like hot sand drinks water, insatiable. Andit was not fables, falsified history, diluted religion, and the cheapfiction that corrupts-but social and economic theories, philosophy,the works of Tolstoy, Gogol, and Gorky....Then the Talk, beside which Carlyle's "flood of French speech" was amere trickle. Lectures, debates, speeches-in theatres, circuses,school-houses, clubs, Soviet meeting-rooms, Union headquarters,barracks.... Meetings in the trenches at the Front, in village squares,factories.... What a marvellous sight to see Putilovsky Zavod (thePutilov factory) pour out its forty thousand to listen to SocialDemocrats, Socialist Revolutionaries, Anarchists, anybody, whateverthey had to say, as long as they would talk! For months in Petrograd,and all over Russia, every street-corner was a public tribune. Inrailway trains, street-cars, always the spurting up of impromptudebate, everywhere....And the All-Russian Conferences and Congresses, drawing together themen of two continents-conventions of Soviets, of Cooperatives,Zemstvos, [*] nationalities, priests, peasants, political parties; the[* See Notes and Explanations]Democratic Conference, the Moscow Conference, the Council of theRussian Republic. There were always three or four conventions goingon in Petrograd. At every meeting, attempts to limit the time ofspeakers voted down, and every man free to express the thought thatwas in him....We came down to the front of the Twelfth Army, back of Riga, wheregaunt and bootless men sickened in the mud of desperate trenches; andwhen they saw us they started up, with their pinched faces and theflesh showing blue through their torn clothing, demanding eagerly,"Did you bring anything to _read?"_What though the outward and visible signs of change were many, whatthough the statue of Catharine the Great before the AlexandrinskyTheatre bore a little red flag in its hand, and others-somewhatfaded-floated from all public buildings; and the Imperial monogramsand eagles were either torn down or covered up; and in place of thefierce _gorodovoye_ (city police) a mild-mannered and unarmed citizenmilitia patrolled the streets-still, there were many quaintanachronisms.For example, Peter the Great's _Tabel o Rangov-_Table of Ranks-whichhe rivetted upon Russia with an iron hand, still held sway. Almosteverybody from the school-boy up wore his prescribed uniform, withthe insignia of the Emperor on button and shoulder-strap. Along aboutfive o'clock in the afternoon the streets were full of subdued oldgentlemen in uniform, with portfolios, going home from work in thehuge, barrack-like Ministries or Government institutions, calculatingperhaps how great a mortality among their superiors would advancethem to the coveted _tchin_ (rank) of Collegiate Assessor, or PrivyCouncillor, with the prospect of retirement on a comfortable pension,and possibly the Cross of St. Anne....There is the story of Senator Sokolov, who in full tide of Revolutioncame to a meeting of the Senate one day in civilian clothes, and wasnot admitted because he did not wear the prescribed livery of theTsar's service!It was against this background of a whole nation in ferment anddisintegration that the pageant of the Rising of the Russian Massesunrolled....                              Chapter II                          The Coming StormIN September General Kornilov marched on Petrograd to make himselfmilitary dictator of Russia. Behind him was suddenly revealed themailed fist of the bourgeoisie, boldly attempting to crush theRevolution. Some of the Socialist Ministers were implicated; evenKerensky was under suspicion. (See App. II, Sect. 1) Savinkov,summoned to explain to the Central Committee of his party, theSocialist Revolutionaries, refused and was expelled. Kornilov wasarrested by the Soldiers' Committees. Generals were dismissed,Ministers suspended from their functions, and the Cabinet fell.Kerensky tried to form a new Government, including the Cadets, partyof the bourgeoisie. His party, the Socialist Revolutionaries,ordered him to exclude the Cadets. Kerensky declined to obey, andthreatened to resign from the Cabinet if the Socialists insisted.However, popular feeling ran so high that for the moment he did notdare oppose it, and a temporary Directorate of Five of the oldMinisters, with Kerensky at the head, assumed the power until thequestion should be settled.The Kornilov affair drew together all the Socialistgroups-"moderates" as well as revolutionists-in a passionate impulseof self-defence. There must be no more Kornilovs. A new Governmentmust be created, responsible to the elements supporting theRevolution. So the _Tsay-ee-kah_ invited the popular organisationsto send delegates to a Democratic Conference, which should meet atPetrograd in September.In the _Tsay-ee-kah_ three factions immediately appeared. TheBolsheviki demanded that the All-Russian Congress of Soviets besummoned, and that they take over the power. The "centre" SocialistRevolutionaries, led by Tchernov, joined with the Left SocialistRevolutionaries, led by Kamkov and Spiridonova, the MenshevikiInternationalists under Martov, and the "centre" Mensheviki, [*][* See Notes and Explanations.]represented by Bogdanov and Skobeliev, in demanding a purelySocialist Government. Tseretelli, Dan and Lieber, at the head of theright wing Mensheviki, and the right Socialist Revolutionaries underAvksentiev and Gotz, insisted that the propertied classes must berepresented in the new Government.Almost immediately the Bolsheviki won a majority in the PetrogradSoviet, and the Soviets of Moscow, Kiev, Odessa and other citiesfollowed suit.Alarmed, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries in control ofthe _Tsay-ee-kah_ decided that after all they feared the danger ofKornilov less than the danger of Lenin. They revised the plan ofrepresentation in the Democratic Conference, (See App. II, Sect. 2)admitting more delegates from the Cooperative Societies and otherconservative bodies. Even this packed assembly at first voted for a_Coalition Government without the Cadets._ Only Kerensky's openthreat of resignation, and the alarming cries of the "moderate"Socialists that "the Republic is in danger" persuaded theConference, by a small majority, to declare in favour of theprinciple of coalition with the bourgeoisie, and to sanction theestablishment of a sort of consultative Parliament, without anylegislative power, called the Provisional Council of the RussianRepublic. In the new Ministry the propertied classes practicallycontrolled, and in the Council of the Russian Republic they occupieda disproportionate number of seats.The fact is that the _Tsay-ee-kah_ no longer represented the rankand file of the Soviets, and had illegally refused to call anotherAll-Russian Congress of Soviets, due in September. It had nointention of calling this Congress or of allowing it to be called.Its official organ, _Izviestia_ (News), began to hint that thefunction of the Soviets was nearly at an end, (See App. II, Sect. 3)and that they might soon be dissolved... At this time, too, the newGovernment announced as part of its policy the liquidation of"irresponsible organisations"-i.e. the Soviets.The Bolsheviki responded by summoning the All-Russian Soviets tomeet at Petrograd on November 2, and take over the Government ofRussia. At the same time they withdrew from the Council of theRussian Republic, stating that they would not participate in a"Government of Treason to the People." (See App. II, Sect. 4)The withdrawal of the Bolsheviki, however, did not bringtranquillity to the ill-fated Council. The propertied classes, nowin a position of power, became arrogant. The Cadets declared thatthe Government had no legal right to declare Russia a republic. Theydemanded stern measures in the Army and Navy to destroy theSoldiers' and Sailors' Committees, and denounced the Soviets. On theother side of the chamber the Mensheviki Internationalists and theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries advocated immediate peace, land tothe peasants, and workers' control of industry-practically theBolshevik programme.I heard Martov's speech in answer to the Cadets. Stooped over thedesk of the tribune like the mortally sick man he was, and speakingin a voice so hoarse it could hardly be heard, he shook his fingertoward the right benches:"You call us defeatists; but the real defeatists are those who waitfor a more propitious moment to conclude peace, insist uponpostponing peace until later, until nothing is left of the Russianarmy, until Russia becomes the subject of bargaining between thedifferent imperialist groups.... You are trying to impose upon theRussian people a policy dictated by the interests of thebourgeoisie. The question of peace should be raised without delay....You will see then that not in vain has been the work of those whomyou call German agents, of those Zimmerwaldists [*] who in all the[* Members of the revoloutionary internationalist wing of theSocialists of Europe, so-called because of their participationin the International Conference held at Zimmerwald, Switzerland,in 1915]lands have prepared the awakening of the conscience of thedemocratic masses...."Between these two groups the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries wavered, irresistibly forced to the left by thepressure of the rising dissatisfaction of the masses. Deep hostilitydivided the chamber into irreconcilable groups.This was the situation when the long-awaited announcement of theAllied Conference in Paris brought up the burning question offoreign policy....Theoretically all Socialist parties in Russia were in favour of theearliest possible peace on democratic terms. As long ago as May,1917, the Petrograd Soviet, then under control of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries,had proclaimed the famous Russianpeace-conditions. They had demanded that the Allies hold aconference to discuss war-aims. This conference had been promisedfor August; then postponed until September; then until October; andnow it was fixed for November 10th.The Provisional Government suggested two representatives-GeneralAlexeyev, reactionary military man, and Terestchenko, Minister ofForeign Affairs. The Soviets chose Skobeliev to speak for them anddrew up a manifesto, the famous _nakaz_- (See App. II, Sect. 5)instructions. The Provisional Government  objected to Skobeliev andhis _nakaz;_ the Allied ambassadors protested and finally Bonar Lawin the British House of Commons, in answer to a question, respondedcoldly, "As far as I know the Paris Conference will not discuss theaims of the war at all, but only the methods of conducting it...."At this the conservative Russian press was jubilant, and theBolsheviki cried, "See where the compromising tactics of theMensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries have led them!"Along a thousand miles of front the millions of men in Russia'sarmies stirred like the sea rising, pouring into the capital theirhundreds upon hundreds of delegations, crying "Peace! Peace!"I went across the river to the Cirque Moderne, to one of the greatpopular meetings which occurred all over the city, more numerousnight after night. The bare, gloomy amphitheatre, lit by five tinylights hanging from a thin wire, was packed from the ring up thesteep sweep of grimy benches to the very roof-soldiers, sailors,workmen, women, all listening as if their lives depended upon it. Asoldier was speaking-from the Five Hundred and Forty-eight Division,wherever and whatever that was:"Comrades," he cried, and there was real anguish in his drawn faceand despairing gestures. "The people at the top are always callingupon us to sacrifice more, sacrifice more, while those who haveeverything are left unmolested."We are at war with Germany. Would we invite German generals toserve on our Staff? Well we're at war with the capitalists too, andyet we invite them into our Government...."The soldier says, 'Show me what I am fighting for. Is itConstantinople, or is it free Russia? Is it the democracy, or is itthe capitalist plunderers? If you can prove to me that I amdefending the Revolution then I'll go out and fight without capitalpunishment to force me.'"When the land belongs to the peasants, and the factories to theworkers, and the power to the Soviets, then we'll know we havesomething to fight for, and we'll fight for it!"In the barracks, the factories, on the street-corners, end lesssoldier speakers, all clamouring for an end to the war, declaringthat if the Government did not make an energetic effort to getpeace, the army would leave the trenches and go home.The spokesman for the Eighth Army:"We are weak, we have only a few men left in each company. They mustgive us food and boots and reinforcements, or soon there will beleft only empty trenches. Peace or supplies... either let theGovernment end the war or support the Army...."For the Forty-sixth Siberian Artillery:"The officers will not work with our Committees, they betray us tothe enemy, they apply the death penalty to our agitators; and thecounter-revolutionary Government supports them. We thought that theRevolution would bring peace. But now the Government forbids us evento talk of such things, and at the same time doesn't give us enoughfood to live on, or enough ammunition to fight with...."From Europe came rumours of peace at the expense of Russia. (SeeApp. II, Sect. 6)...News of the treatment of Russian troops in France added to thediscontent. The First Brigade had tried to replace its officers withSoldiers' Committees, like their comrades at home, and had refusedan order to go to Salonika, demanding to be sent to Russia. They hadbeen surrounded and starved, and then fired on by artillery, andmany killed. (See App. II, Sect. 7)...On October 29th I went to the white-marble and crimson hall of theMarinsky palace, where the Council of the Republic sat, to hearTerestchenko's declaration of the Government's foreign policy,awaited with such terrible anxiety by all the peace-thirsty andexhausted land.A tall, impeccably-dressed young man with a smooth face and highcheek-bones, suavely reading his careful, non-committal speech. (SeeApp. II, Sect. 8) Nothing.... Only the same platitudes about crushingGerman militarism with the help of the Allies-about the "stateinterests" of Russia, about the "embarrassment" caused bySkobeliev's _nakaz._ He ended with the key-note:"Russia is a great power. Russia will remain a great power, whateverhappens. We must all defend her, we must show that we are defendersof a great ideal, and children of a great power."Nobody was satisfied. The reactionaries wanted a "strong"imperialist policy; the democratic parties wanted an assurance thatthe Government would press for peace.... I reproduce an editorial in_Rabotchi i Soldat_ (Worker and Soldier), organ of the BolshevikPetrograd Soviet:THE GOVERNMENT'S ANSWER TO THE TRENCHESThe most taciturn of our Ministers, Mr. Terestchenko, has actuallytold the trenches the following:1. We are closely united with our Allies. (Not with the peoples, butwith the Governments.)2. There is no use for the democracy to discuss the possibility orimpossibility of a winter campaign. That will be decided by theGovernments of our Allies.3. The 1st of July offensive was beneficial and a very happy affair.(He did not mention the consequences.)4. It is not true that our Allies do not care about us. The Ministerhas in his possession very important declarations. (Declarations?What about deeds? What about the behaviour of the British fleet?(See App. II, Sect. 9) The parleying of the British king with exiledcounter-revolutionary General Gurko? The Minister did not mentionall this.)5. The _nakaz_ to Skobeliev is bad; the Allies don't like it and theRussian diplomats don't like it. In the Allied Conference we mustall 'speak one language.'And is that all? That is all. What is the way out? The solution is,faith in the Allies and in Terestchenko. When will peace come? Whenthe Allies permit.That is how the Government replied to the trenches about peace!Now in the background of Russian politics began to form the vagueoutlines of a sinister power-the Cossacks. _Novaya Zhizn_ (NewLife), Gorky's paper, called attention to their activities:At the beginning of the Revolution the Cossacks refused to shootdown the people. When Kornilov marched on Petrograd they refused tofollow him. From passive loyalty to the Revolution the Cossacks havepassed to an active political offensive (against it). From theback-ground of the Revolution they have suddenly advanced to thefront of the stage....Kaledin, _ataman_ of the Don Cossacks, had been dismissed by theProvisional Government for his complicity in the Kornilov affair. Heflatly refused to resign, and surrounded by three immense Cossackarmies lay at Novotcherkask, plotting and menacing. So great was hispower that the Government was forced to ignore his insubordination.More than that, it was compelled formally to recognise the Councilof the Union of Cossack Armies, and to declare illegal thenewly-formed Cossack Section of the Soviets....In the first part of October a Cossack delegation called uponKerensky, arrogantly insisting that the charges against Kaledin bedropped, and reproaching the Minister-President for yielding to theSoviets. Kerensky agreed to let Kaledin alone, and then is reportedto have said, "In the eyes of the Soviet leaders I am a despot and atyrant.... As for the Provisional Government, not only does it notdepend upon the Soviets, but it considers it regrettable that theyexist at all."At the same time another Cossack mission called upon the Britishambassador, treating with him boldly as representatives of "the freeCossack people."In the Don something very like a Cossack Republic had beenestablished. The Kuban declared itself an independent Cossack State.The Soviets of Rostov-on-Don and Yekaterinburg were dispersed byarmed Cossacks, and the headquarters of the Coal Miners' Union atKharkov raided. In all its manifestations the Cossack movement wasanti-Socialist and militaristic. Its leaders were nobles and greatland-owners, like Kaledin, Kornilov, Generals Dutov, Karaulov andBardizhe, and it was backed by the powerful merchants and bankers ofMoscow....Old Russia was rapidly breaking up. In Ukraine, in Finland, Poland,White Russia, the nationalist movements gathered strength and becamebolder. The local Governments, controlled by the propertied classes,claimed autonomy, refusing to obey orders from Petrograd. AtHelsingfors the Finnish Senate declined to loan money to theProvisional Government, declared Finland autonomous, and demandedthe withdrawal of Russian troops. The bourgeois Rada at Kievextended the boundaries of Ukraine until they included all therichest agricultural lands of South Russia, as far east as theUrals, and began the formation of a national army. PremierVinnitchenko hinted at a separate peace with Germany-and theProvisional Government was helpless. Siberia, the Caucasus, demandedseparate Constituent Assemblies. And in all these countries therewas the beginning of a bitter struggle between the authorities andthe local Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies....Conditions were daily more chaotic. Hundreds of thousands ofsoldiers were deserting the front and beginning to move in vast,aimless tides over the face of the land. The peasants of Tambov andTver Governments, tired of waiting for the land, exasperated by therepressive measures of the Government, were burning manor-houses andmassacring land-owners. Immense strikes and lock-outs convulsedMoscow, Odessa and the coal-mines of the Don. Transportation wasparalysed; the army was starving and in the big cities there was nobread.The Government, torn between the democratic and reactionaryfactions, could do nothing: when forced to act it always supportedthe interests of the propertied classes. Cossacks were sent torestore order among the peasants, to break the strikes. In Tashkent,Government authorities suppressed the Soviet. In Petrograd theEconomic Council, established to rebuild the shattered economic lifeof the country, came to a deadlock between the opposing forces ofcapital and labour, and was dissolved by Kerensky. The old régimemilitary men, backed by Cadets, demanded that harsh measures beadopted to restore discipline in the Army and the Navy. In vainAdmiral Verderevsky, the venerable Minister of Marine, and GeneralVerkhovsky, Minister of War, insisted that only a new, voluntary,democratic discipline, based on cooperation with the soldiers' andsailors' Committees, could save the army and navy. Theirrecommendations were ignored.The reactionaries seemed determined to provoke popular anger. Thetrial of Kornilov was coming on. More and more openly the bourgeoispress defended him, speaking of him as "the great Russian patriot."Burtzev's paper, _Obshtchee Dielo_ (Common Cause), called for adictatorship of Kornilov, Kaledin and Kerensky!I had a talk with Burtzev one day in the press gallery of theCouncil of the Republic. A small, stooped figure with a wrinkledface, eyes near-sighted behind thick glasses, untidy hair and beardstreaked with grey."Mark my words, young man! What Russia needs is a Strong Man. Weshould get our minds off the Revolution now and concentrate on theGermans. Bunglers, bunglers, to defeat Kornilov; and back of thebunglers are the German agents. Kornilov should have won...."On the extreme right the organs of the scarcely-veiled Monarchists,Purishkevitch's _Narodny Tribun_ (People's Tribune), _Novaya Rus_(New Russia), and _Zhivoye Slovo_ (Living Word), openly advocatedthe extermination of the revolutionary democracy....On the 23rd of October occurred the naval battle with a Germansquadron in the Gulf of Riga. On the pretext that Petrograd was indanger, the Provisional Government drew up plans for evacuating thecapital. First the great munitions works were to go, distributedwidely throughout Russia; and then the Government itself was to moveto Moscow. Instantly the Bolsheviki began to cry out that theGovernment was abandoning the Red Capital in order to weaken theRevolution. Riga had been sold to the Germans; now Petrograd wasbeing betrayed!The bourgeois press was joyful. "At Moscow," said the Cadet paper_Ryetch_ (Speech), "the Government can pursue its work in a tranquilatmosphere, without being interfered with by anarchists." Rodzianko,leader of the right wing of the Cadet party, declared in _UtroRossii_ (The Morning of Russia) that the taking of Petrograd by theGermans would be a blessing, because it would destroy the Sovietsand get rid of the revolutionary Baltic Fleet:Petrograd is in danger (he wrote). I say to myself, "Let God takecare of Petrograd." They fear that if Petrograd is lost the centralrevolutionary organisations will be destroyed. To that I answer thatI rejoice if all these organisations are destroyed; for they willbring nothing but disaster upon Russia....With the taking of Petrograd the Baltic Fleet will also bedestroyed.... But there will be nothing to regret; most of thebattleships are completely demoralised....In the face of a storm of popular disapproval the plan of evacuationwas repudiated.Meanwhile the Congress of Soviets loomed over Russia like athunder-cloud, shot through with lightnings. It was opposed, notonly by the Government but by all the "moderate" Socialists. TheCentral Army and Fleet Committees, the Central Committees of some ofthe Trade Unions, the Peasants' Soviets, but most of all the_Tsay-ee-kah_ itself, spared no pains to prevent the meeting._Izviestia_ and _Golos Soldata_ (Voice of the Soldier), newspapersfounded by the Petrograd Soviet but now in the hands of the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ fiercely assailed it, as did the entire artillery ofthe Socialist Revolutionary party press, _Dielo Naroda_ (People'sCause) and _Volia Naroda_ (People's Will).Delegates were sent through the country, messages flashed by wire tocommittees in charge of local Soviets, to Army Committees,instructing them to halt or delay elections to the Congress. Solemnpublic resolutions against the Congress, declarations that thedemocracy was opposed to the meeting so near the date of theConstituent Assembly, representatives from the Front, from the Unionof Zemstvos, the Peasants' Union, Union of Cossack Armies, Union ofOfficers, Knights of St. George, Death Battalions, [*] protesting....[*See Notes and Explanations.]The Council of the Russian Republic was one chorus of disapproval.The entire machinery set up by the Russian Revolution of Marchfunctioned to block the Congress of Soviets....On the other hand was the shapeless will of the proletariat-theworkmen, common soldiers and poor peasants. Many local Soviets werealready Bolshevik; then there were the organisations of theindustrial workers, the _Fabritchno-Zavodskiye Comitieti-_Factory-Shop Committees; and the insurgent Army and Fleetorganisations. In some places the people, prevented from electingtheir regular Soviet delegates, held rump meetings and chose one oftheir number to go to Petrograd. In others they smashed the oldobstructionist committees and formed new ones. A ground-swell ofrevolt heaved and cracked the crust which had been slowly hardeningon the surface of revolutionary fires dormant all those months. Onlyan spontaneous mass-movement could bring about the All-RussianCongress of Soviets....Day after day the Bolshevik orators toured the barracks andfactories, violently denouncing "this Government of civil war." OneSunday we went, on a top-heavy steam tram that lumbered throughoceans of mud, between stark factories and immense churches, to_Obukhovsky Zavod,_ a Government munitions-plant out on theSchlüsselburg Prospekt.The meeting took place between the gaunt brick walls of a hugeunfinished building, ten thousand black-clothed men and women packedaround a scaffolding draped in red, people heaped on piles of lumberand bricks, perched high upon shadowy girders, intent andthunder-voiced. Through the dull, heavy sky now and again burst thesun, flooding reddish light through the skeleton windows upon themass of simple faces upturned to us.Lunatcharsky, a slight, student-like figure with the sensitive faceof an artist, was telling why the power must be taken by theSoviets. Nothing else could guarantee the Revolution against itsenemies, who were deliberately ruining the country, ruining thearmy, creating opportunities for a new Konilov.A soldier from the Rumanian front, thin, tragical and fierce, cried,"Comrades! We are starving at the front, we are stiff with cold. Weare dying for no reason. I ask the American comrades to carry wordto America, that the Russians will never give up their Revolutionuntil they die. We will hold the fort with all our strength untilthe peoples of the world rise and help us! Tell the American workersto rise and fight for the Social Revolution!"Then came Petrovsky, slight, slow-voiced, implacable: "Now is thetime for deeds, not words. The economic situation is bad, but wemust get used to it. They are trying to starve us and freeze us.They are trying to provoke us. But let them know that they can gotoo far-that if they dare to lay their hands upon the organisationsof the proletariat we will sweep them away like scum from the faceof the earth!"The Bolshevik press suddenly expanded. Besides the two party papers,_Rabotchi Put_ and _Soldat_ (Soldier), there appeared a new paperfor the peasants, _Derevenskaya Byednota_ (Village Poorest), pouredout in a daily half-million edition; and on October 17th, _Rabotchii Soldat._ Its leading article summed up the Bolshevik point of view:The fourth year's campaign will mean the annihilation of the armyand the country.... There is danger for the safety of Petrograd....Counter-revolutionists rejoice in the people's misfortunes.... Thepeasants brought to desperation come out in open rebellion; thelandlords and Government authorities massacre them with punitiveexpeditions; factories and mines are closing down, workmen arethreatened with starvation.... The bourgeoisie and its Generals wantto restore a blind discipline in the army.... Supported by thebourgeoisie, the Kornilovtsi are openly getting ready to break upthe meeting of the Constituent Assembly....The Kerensky Government is against the people. He will destroy thecountry.... This paper stands for the people and by the people-thepoor classes, workers, soldiers and peasants. The people can only besaved by the completion of the Revolution... and for this purpose thefull power must be in the hands of the Soviets....This paper advocates the following: All power to the Soviets-both inthe capital and in the provinces.Immediate truce on all fronts. An honest peace between peoples.Landlord estates-without compensation-to the peasants.Workers' control over industrial production.A faithfully and honestly elected Constituent Assembly.It is interesting to reproduce here a passage from that samepaper-the organ of those Bolsheviki so well known to the world asGerman agents:The German kaiser, covered with the blood of millions of deadpeople, wants to push his army against Petrograd. Let us call to theGerman workmen, soldiers and peasants, who want peace not less thanwe do, to... stand up against this damned war!This can be done only by a revolutionary Government, which wouldspeak really for the workmen, soldiers and peasants of Russia, andwould appeal over the heads of the diplomats directly to the Germantroops, fill the German trenches with proclamations in the Germanlanguage.... Our airmen would spread these proclamations all overGermany....In the Council of the Republic the gulf between the two sides of thechamber deepened day by day."The propertied classes," cried Karelin, for the Left SocialistRevolutionaries, "want to exploit the revolutionary machine of theState to bind Russia to the war-chariot of the Allies! Therevolutionary parties are absolutely against this policy...."Old Nicholas Tchaikovsky, representing the Populist Socialists,spoke against giving the land to the peasants, and took the side ofthe Cadets: "We must have immediately strong discipline in thearmy.... Since the beginning of the war I have not ceased to insistthat it is a crime to undertake social and economic reforms inwar-time. We are committing that crime, and yet I am not the enemyof these reforms, because I am a Socialist."Cries from the Left, "We don't believe you!" Mighty applause fromthe Right....Adzhemov, for the Cadets, declared that there was no necessity totell the army what it was fighting for, since every soldier ought torealise that the first task was to drive the enemy from Russianterritory.Kerensky himself came twice, to plead passionately for nationalunity, once bursting into tears at the end. The assembly heard himcoldly, interrupting with ironical remarks.Smolny Institute, headquarters of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and of thePetrograd Soviet, lay miles out on the edge of the city, beside thewide Neva. I went there on a street-car, moving snail-like with agroaning noise through the cobbled, muddy streets, and jammed withpeople. At the end of the line rose the graceful smoke-blue cupolasof Smolny Convent outlined in dull gold, beautiful; and beside itthe great barracks like façade of Smolny Institute, two hundredyards long and three lofty stories high, the Imperial arms carvedhugely in stone still insolent over the entrance....Under the old régime a famous convent-school for the daughters ofthe Russian nobility, patronised by the Tsarina herself, theInstitute had been taken over by the revolutionary organisations ofworkers and soldiers. Within were more than a hundred huge rooms,white and bare, on their doors enamelled plaques still informing thepasserby that within was "Ladies' Class-room Number 4" or "Teachers'Bureau"; but over these hung crudely-lettered signs, evidence of thevitality of the new order: "Central Committee of the PetrogradSoviet" and _"Tsay-ee-kah"_ and "Bureau of Foreign Affairs"; "Unionof Socialist Soldiers," "Central Committee of the All-Russian TradeUnions," "Factory-Shop Committees," "Central Army Committee"; andthe central offices and caucus-rooms of the political parties....The long, vaulted corridors, lit by rare electric lights, werethronged with hurrying shapes of soldiers and workmen, some bentunder the weight of huge bundles of newspapers, proclamations,printed propaganda of all sorts. The sound of their heavy boots madea deep and incessant thunder on the wooden floor.... Signs were postedup everywhere: "Comrades! For the sake of your health, preservecleanliness!" Long tables stood at the head of the stairs on everyfloor, and on the landings, heaped with pamphlets and the literatureof the different political parties, for sale....The spacious, low-ceilinged refectory downstairs was still adining-room. For two rubles I bought a ticket entitling me todinner, and stood in line with a thousand others, waiting to get tothe long serving-tables, where twenty men and women were ladlingfrom immense cauldrons cabbage soup, hunks of meat and piles of_kasha,_ slabs of black bread. Five kopeks paid for tea in a tincup. From a basket one grabbed a greasy wooden spoon.... The benchesalong the wooden tables were packed with hungry proletarians,wolfing their food, plotting, shouting rough jokes across the room....[Graphic page-33 -- text of placard in russian, translation follows]COMRADESFOR THE SAKE OF YOUR HEALTH,PRESERVE CLEANLINESS.Upstairs was another eating-place, reserved for the _Tsay-ee-kah-_though every one went there. Here could be had bread thicklybuttered and endless glasses of tea....In the south wing on the second floor was the great hall ofmeetings, the former ball-room of the Institute. A lofty white roomlighted by glazed-white chandeliers holding hundreds of ornateelectric bulbs, and divided by two rows of massive columns; at oneend a dais, flanked with two tall many-branched light standards, anda gold frame behind, from which the Imperial portrait had been cut.Here on festal occasions had been banked brilliant military andecclesiastical uniforms, a setting for Grand Duchesses....Just across the hall outside was the office of the CredentialsCommittee for the Congress of Soviets. I stood there watching thenew delegates come in-burly, bearded soldiers, workmen in blackblouses, a few long-haired peasants. The girl in charge-a member ofPlekhanov's _Yedinstvo_ [*] group-smiled contemptuously. "These are[* See Notes and Explanations]very different people from the delegates to the first _Siezd_(Congress)," she remarked. "See how rough and ignorant they look!The Dark People...." It was true; the depths of Russia had beenstirred, and it was the bottom which came uppermost now. TheCredentials Committee, appointed by the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ waschallenging delegate after delegate, on the ground that they hadbeen illegally elected. Karakhan, member of the Bolshevik CentralCommittee, simply grinned. "Never mind," he said, "When the timecomes we'll see that you get your seats...."_Rabotchi i Soldat_ said:The attention of delegates to the new All-Russian Congress is calledto attempts of certain members of the Organising Committee to breakup the Congress, by asserting that it will not take place, and thatdelegates had better leave Petrograd.... Pay no attention to theselies.... Great days are coming....It was evident that a quorum would not come together by November 2,so the opening of the Congress was postponed to the 7th. But thewhole country was now aroused; and the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries, realising that they were defeated, suddenly changedtheir tactics and began to wire frantically to their provincialorganisations to elect as many "moderate" Socialist delegates aspossible. At the same time the Executive Committee of the Peasants'Soviets issued an emergency call for a Peasants' Congress, to meetDecember 13th and offset whatever action the workers and soldiersmight take...What would the Bolsheviki do? Rumours ran through the city thatthere would be an armed "demonstration," a _vystuplennie_-"comingout" of the workers and soldiers. The bourgeois and reactionarypress prophesied insurrection, and urged the Government to arrestthe Petrograd Soviet, or at least to prevent the meeting of theCongress. Such sheets as _Novaya Rus_ advocated a general Bolshevikmassacre.Gorky's paper, _Novaya Zhizn,_ agreed with the Bolsheviki that thereactionaries were attempting to destroy the Revolution, and that ifnecessary they must be resisted by force of arms; but all theparties of the revolutionary democracy must present a united front.As long as the democracy has not organised its principal forces, solong as the resistance to its influence is still strong, there is noadvantage in passing to the attack. But if the hostile elementsappeal to force, then the revolutionary democracy should enter thebattle to seize the power, and it will be sustained by the mostprofound strata of the people....Gorky pointed out that both reactionary and Government newspaperswere inciting the Bolsheviki to violence. An insurrection, however,would prepare the way for a new Kornilov. He urged the Bolsheviki todeny the rumours. Potressov, in the Menshevik _Dien_ (Day),published a sensational story, accompanied by a map, which professedto reveal the secret Bolshevik plan of campaign.As if by magic, the walls were covered with warnings, (See App. II,Sect. 10) proclamations, appeals, from the Central Committees of the"moderate" and conservative factions and the _Tsay-ee-kah,_denouncing any "demonstrations," imploring the workers and soldiersnot to listen to agitators. For instance, this from the MilitarySection of the Socialist Revolutionary party:Again rumours are spreading around the town of an intended_vystuplennie._ What is the source of these rumours? Whatorganisation authorises these agitators who preach insurrection? TheBolsheviki, to a question addressed to them in the _Tsay-ee-kah,_denied that they have anything to do with it.... But these rumoursthemselves carry with them a great danger. It may easily happenthat, not taking into consideration the state of mind of themajority of the workers, soldiers and peasants, individual hot-headswill call out part of the workers and soldiers on the streets,inciting them to an uprising.... In this fearful time through whichrevolutionary Russia is passing, any insurrection can easily turninto civil war, and there can result from it the destruction of allorganisations of the proletariat, built up with so much labour.... Thecounter-revolutionary plotters are planning to take advantage ofthis insurrection to destroy the Revolution, open the front toWilhelm, and wreck the Constituent Assembly.... Stick stubbornly toyour posts! Do not come out!On October 28th, in the corridors of Smolny, I spoke with Kameniev,a little man with a reddish pointed beard and Gallic gestures. Hewas not at all sure that enough delegates would come. "If there _is_a Congress," he said, "it will represent the overwhelming sentimentof the people. If the majority is Bolshevik, as I think it will be,we shall demand that the power be given to the Soviets, and theProvisional Government must resign...."Volodarsky, a tall, pale youth with glasses and a bad complexion,was more definite. "The 'Lieber-Dans' and the other compromisers aresabotaging the Congress. If they succeed in preventing itsmeeting,-well, then we are realists enough not to depend on _that!"_Under date of October 29th I find entered in my notebook thefollowing items culled from the newspapers of the day:Moghilev (General Staff Headquarters). Concentration here of loyalGuard Regiments, the Savage Division, Cossacks and Death Battalions.The _yunkers_ of the Officers' Schools of Pavlovsk, Tsarskoye Seloand Peterhof ordered by the Government to be ready to come toPetrograd. Oranienbaum _yunkers_ arrive in the city.Part of the Armoured Car Division of the Petrograd garrism stationedin the Winter Palace.Upon orders signed by Trotzky, several thousand rifles delivered bythe Government Arms Factory at Sestroretzk to delegates of thePetrograd workmen.At a meeting of the City Militia of the Lower Liteiny Quarter, aresolution demanding that all power be given to the Soviets.This is just a sample of the confused events of those feverish days,when everybody knew that something was going to happen, but nobodyknew just what.At a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet in Smolny, the night of October30th, Trotzky branded the assertions of the bourgeois press that theSoviet contemplated armed insurention as "an attempt of thereactionaries to discredit and wreck the Congress of Soviets.... ThePetrograd Soviet," he declared, "had not ordered any _uystuplennie._If it is necessary we shall do so, and we will be supported by thePetrogruad garrison.... They (the Government) are preparing acounter-revolution; and we shall answer with an offensive which willbe merciless and decisive."It is true that the Petrograd Soviet had not ordered ademonstration, but the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party wasconsidering the question of insurrection. All night long the 23dthey met. There were present all the party intellectuals, theleaders-and delegates of the Petrograd workers and garrison. Aloneof the intellectuals Lenin and Trotzky stood for insurrection. Even   urrection. Even   |          |the military men opposed it. A vote was taken. Insurrection wasdefeated!Then arose a rough workman, his face convulsed with rage. "I speakfor the Petrograd proletariat," he said, harshly. "We are in favourof insurrection. Have it your own way, but I tell you now that ifyou allow the Soviets to be destroyed, _we're through with you!"_Some soldiers joined him.... And after that they votedagain-insurrection won....However, the right wing of the Bolsheviki, led by Riazanov, Kamenievand Zinoviev, continued to campaign against an armed rising. On themorning of October 31st appeared in _Rabotchi Put_ the firstinstalment of Lenin's "Letter to the Comrades," (See App. II, Sect.11) one of the most audacious pieces of political propaganda theworld has ever seen. In it Lenin seriously presented the argumentsin favour of insurrection, taking as text the objections of Kamenievand Riazonov."Either we must abandon our slogan, 'All Power to the Soviets,' " hewrote, "or else we must make an insurrection. There is no middlecourse...."That same afternoon Paul Miliukov, leader of the Cadets, made abrilliant, bitter speech (See App. II, Sect. 12) in the Council ofthe Republic, branding the Skobeliev _nakaz_ as pro-German,declaring that the "revolutionary democracy" was destroying Russia,sneering at Terestchenko, and openly declaring that he preferredGerman diplomacy to Russian.... The Left benches were one roaringtumult all through....On its part the Government could not ignore the significance of thesuccess of the Bolshevik propaganda. On the 29th joint commission ofthe Government and the Council of the Republic hastily drew up twolaws, one for giving the land temporarily to the peasants, and theother for pushing an energetic foreign policy of peace. The next dayKerensky suspended capital punishment in the army. That sameafternoon was opened with great ceremony the first session of thenew "Commission for Strengthening the Republican Régime and FightingAgainst Anarchy and Counter-Revolution"-of which history shows notthe slightest further trace.... The following morning with two othercorrespondents I interviewed Kerensky (See App. II, Sect. 13)-thelast time he received journalists."The Russian people," he said, bitterly, "are suffering fromeconomic fatigue-and from disillusionment with the Allies! The worldthinks that the Russian Revolution is at an end. Do not be mistaken.The Russian Revolution is just beginning...." Words more prophetic,perhaps, than he knew.Stormy was the all-night meeting of the Petrograd Soviet the 30th ofOctober, at which I was present. The "moderate" Socialistintellectuals, officers, members of Army Committees, the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ were there in force. Against them rose up workmen,peasants and common soldiers, passionate and simple.A peasant told of the disorders in Tver, which he said were causedby the arrest of the Land Committees. "This Kerensky is nothing buta shield to the _pomieshtchiki_ (landowners)," he cried. "They knowthat at the Constituent Assembly we will take the land anyway, sothey are trying to destroy the Constituent Assembly!"A machinist from the Putilov works described how the superintendentswere closing down the departments one by one on the pretext thatthere was no fuel or raw materials. The Factory-Shop Committee, hedeclared, had discovered huge hidden supplies."It is a _provocatzia,"_ said he. "They want to starve us-or driveus to violence!"Among the soldiers one began, "Comrades! I bring you greetings fromthe place where men are digging their graves and call them trenches!"Then arose a tall, gaunt young soldier, with flashing eyes, met witha roar of welcome. It was Tchudnovsky, reported killed in the Julyfighting, and now risen from the dead."The soldier masses no longer trust their officers. Even the ArmyCommittees, who refused to call a meeting of our Soviet, betrayedus.... The masses of the soldiers want the Constituent Assembly to beheld exactly when it was called for, and those who dare to postponeit will be cursed-and not only platonic curses either, for the Armyhas guns too...."He told of the electoral campaign for the Constituent now raging inthe Fifth Army. "The officers, and especially the Mensheviki and theSocialist Revolutionaries, are trying deliberately to cripple theBolsheviki. Our papers are not allowed to circulate in the trenches.Our speakers are arrested-""Why don't you speak about the lack of bread?" shouted anothersoldier."Man shall not live by bread alone," answered Tchudnovsky, sternly....Followed him an officer, delegate from the Vitebsk Soviet, aMenshevik _oboronetz._ "It isn't the question of who has the power.The trouble is not with the Government, but with the war.... and thewar must be won before any change-" At this, hoots and ironicalcheers. "These Bolshevik agitators are demagogues!" The hall rockedwith laughter. "Let us for a moment forget the class struggle-" Buthe got no farther. A voice yelled, "Don't you wish we would!"Petrograd presented a curious spectacle in those days. In thefactories the committe-rooms were filled with stacks of rifles,couriers came and went, the Red Guard [*] drilled.... In all the[* See Notes and Explanations]barracks meetings every night, and all day long interminable hotarguments. On the streets the crowds thickened toward gloomyevening, pouring in slow voluble tides up and down the Nevsky,fighting for the newspapers.... Hold-ups increased to such an extentthat it was dangerous to walk down side streets.... On the Sadovayaone afternoon I saw a crowd of several hundred people beat andtrample to death a soldier caught stealing.... Mysterious individualscirculated around the shivering women who waited in _queue_ longcold hours for bread and milk, whispering that the Jews had corneredthe food supply-and that while the people starved, the Sovietmembers lived luxuriously....At Smolny there were strict guards at the door and the outer gates,demanding everybody's pass. The committee-rooms buzzed and hummedall day and all night, hundreds of soldiers and workmen slept on thefloor, wherever they could find room. Upstairs in the great hall athousand people crowded to the uproarious sessions of the PetrogradSoviet....Gambling clubs functioned hectically from dusk to dawn, withchampagne flowing and stakes of twenty thousand rubles. In thecentre of the city at night prostitutes in jewels and expensive furswalked up and down, crowded the cafés....Monarchist plots, German spies, smugglers hatching schemes....And in the rain, the bitter chill, the great throbbing city undergrey skies rushing faster and faster toward-what?                              Chapter III                              On the EveIN the relations of a weak Government and a rebellious people therecomes a time when every act of the authorities exasperates themasses, and every refusal to act excites their contempt....The proposal to abandon Petrograd raised a hurricane; Kerensky'spublic denial that the Government had any such intention was met withhoots of derision.Pinned to the wall by the pressure of the Revolution (cried _RabotchiPut),_ the Government of "provisional" bourgeois tries to get free bygiving out lying assurances that it never thought of fleeing fromPetrograd, and that it didn't wish to surrender the capital....In Kharkov thirty thousand coal miners organised, adopting thepreamble of the I. W. W. constitution: "The working class and theemploying class have nothing in common." Dispersed by Cossacks, somewere locked out by the mine-owners, and the rest declared a generalstrike. Minister of Commerce and Industry Konovalov appointed hisassistant, Orlov, with plenary powers, to settle the trouble. Orlovwas hated by the miners. But the _Tsay-ee-kah_ not only supported hisappointment, but refused to demand that the Cossacks be recalled fromthe Don Basin....This was followed by the dispersal of the Soviet at Kaluga. TheBolsheviki, having secured a majority in the Soviet, set free somepolitical prisoners. With the sanction of the Government Commissarthe Municipal Duma called in troops from Minsk, and bombarded theSoviet headquarters with artillery. The Bolsheviki yielded, but asthey left the building Cossacks attacked them, crying, "This is whatwe'll do to all the other Bolshevik Soviets, including those ofMoscow and Petrograd!" This incident sent a wave of panic ragethroughout Russia....In Petrograd was ending a regional Congress of Soviets of the North,presided over by the Bolshevik Krylenko. By an immense majority itresolved that all power should be assumed by the All-RussianCongress; and concluded by greeting the Bolsheviki in prison, biddingthem rejoice, for the hour of their liberation was at hand. At thesame time the first All-Russian Conference of Factory-Shop Committees(See App. III, Sect. 1) declared emphatically for the Soviets, andcontinued significantly,After liberating themselves politically from Tsardom, theworking-class wants to see the democratic régime triumphant in thesphere of its productive activity. This is best expressed by Workers'Control over industrial production, which naturally arose in theatmosphere of economic decomposition created by the criminal policyof the dominating classes....The Union of Railwaymen was demanding the resignation of Liverovsky,Minister of Ways and Communications....In the name of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ Skobeliev insisted that the _nakaz_be presented at the Allied Conference, and formally protested againstthe sending of Terestchenko to Paris. Terestchenko offered to resign....General Verkhovsky, unable to accomplish his reorganisation of thearmy, only came to Cabinet meetings at long intervals....On November 3d Burtzev's _Obshtchee Dielo_ came out with greatheadlines:Citizens! Save the fatherland!I have just learned that yesterday, at a meeting of the Commissionfor National Defence, Minister of War General Verkhovsky, one of theprincipal persons responsible for the fall of Kornilov, proposed tosign a separate peace, independently of the Allies.That is treason to Russia!Terestchenko declared that the Provisional Government had not evenexamined Verkhovsky's proposition."You might think," said Terestchenko, "that we were in a madhouse!"The members of the Commission were astounded at the General's words.General Alexeyev wept.No! It is not madness! It is worse. It is direct treason to Russia!Kerensky, Terestchenko and Nekrassov must immediately answer usconcerning the words of Verkhovsky.Citizens, arise!Russia is being sold!Save her!What Verkhovsky really said was that the Allies must be pressed tooffer peace, because the Russian army could fight no longer....Both in Russia and abroad the sensation was tremendous. Verkhovskywas given "indefinite leave of absence for illhealth," and left theGovernment. _Obshtchee Dielo_ was suppressed....Sunday, November 4th, was designated as the Day of the PetrogradSoviet, with immense meetings planned all over the city, ostensiblyto raise money for the organisation and the press; really, to make ademonstration of strength. Suddenly it was announced that on the sameday the Cossacks would hold a _Krestny Khod_-Procession of theCross-in honour of the Ikon of 1612, through whose miraculousintervention Napoleon had been driven from Moscow. The atmosphere waselectric; a spark might kindle civil war. The Petrograd Soviet issueda manifesto, headed "Brothers-Cossacks!"You, Cossacks, are being incited against us, workers and soldiers.This plan of Cain is being put into operation by our common enemies,the oppressors, the privileged classes-generals, bankers, landlords,former officials, former servants of the Tsar.... We are hated by allgrafters, rich men, princes, nobles, generals, including your Cossackgenerals. They are ready at any moment to destroy the PetrogradSoviet and crush the Revolution....On the 4th of November somebody is organising a Cossack religiousprocession. It is a question of the free consciousness of everyindividual whether he will or will not take part in this procession.We do not interfere in this matter, nor do we obstruct anybody....However, we warn you, Cossacks! Look out and see to it that under thepretext of a _Krestni Khod,_ your Kaledins do not instigate youagainst workmen, against soldiers....The procession was hastily called off....In the barracks and the working-class quarters of the town theBolsheviki were preaching, "All Power to the Soviets!" and agents ofthe Dark Forces were urging the people to rise and slaughter theJews, shop-keepers, Socialist leaders....On one side the Monarchist press, inciting to bloody repression-onthe other Lenin's great voice roaring, "Insurrection!.... We cannotwait any longer!"Even the bourgeois press was uneasy. (See App. III, Sect. 2)_Birjevya Viedomosti_ (Exchange Gazette) called the Bolshevikpropaganda an attack on "the most elementary principles ofsociety-personal security and the respect for private property."[Graphic page-46 Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet]Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet to the Cosacks to call off their_Krestny Khod_-the religious procession planned for November 4th (ourcalendar). "Brothers-Cossacks!" it begins. "The Petrograd Soviet ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies addresses you."But it was the "moderate" Socialist journals which were the mosthostile. (See App. III, Sect. 3) "The Bolsheviki are the mostdangerous enemies of the Revolution," declared _Dielo Naroda._ Saidthe Menshevik _Dien,_ "The Government ought to defend itself anddefend us." Plekhanov's paper, _Yedinstvo_ (Unity) (See App. III,Sect. 4), called the attention of the Government to the fact that thePetrograd workers were being armed, and demanded stern measuresagainst the Bolsheviki.Daily the Government seemed to become more helpless. Even theMunicipal administration broke down. The columns of the morningpapers were filled with accounts of the most audacious robberies andmurders, and the criminals were unmolested.On the other hand armed workers patrolled the streets at night, doingbattle with marauders and requisitioning arms wherever they foundthem.On the first of November Colonel Polkovnikov, Military Commander ofPetrograd, issued a proclamation:Despite the difficult days through which the country is passing,irresponsible appeals to armed demonstrations and massacres are stillbeing spread around Petrograd, and from day to day robbery anddisorder increase.This state of things is disorganising the life of the citizens, andhinders the systematic work of the Government and the MunicipalInstitutions.In full consciousness of my responsibility and my duty before mycountry, I command:1. Every military unit, in accordance with special instructions andwithin the territory of its garrison, to afford every assistance tothe Municipality, to the Commissars, and to the militia, in theguarding of Government institutions.2. The organisation of patrols, in co-operation with the DistrictCommander and the representatives of the city militia, and the takingof measures for the arrest of criminals and deserters.3. The arrest of all persons entering barracks and inciting to armeddemonstrations and massacres, and their delivery to the headquartersof the Second Commander of the city.4. To suppress any armed demonstration or riot at its start, with allarmed forces at hand.5. To afford assistance to the Commissars in preventing unwarrantedsearches in houses and unwarranted arrests.6. To report immediately all that happens in the district undercharge to the Staff of the Petrograd Military District.I call upon all Army Committees and organisations to afford theirhelp to the commanders in fulfilment of the duties with which theyare charged.In the Council of the Republic Kerensky declared that the Governmentwas fully aware of the Bolshevik preparations, and had sufficientforce to cope with any demonstration. (See App. III, Sect. 5) Heaccused _Novaya Rus_ and _Robotchi Put_ of both doing the same kindof subversive work. "But owing to the absolute freedom of the press,"he added, "the Government is not in a position to combat printedlies. [*]...." Declaring that these were two aspects of the same[* This was not quite candid.  The Provisional Gevernment hadsuppressed Bolshevik papers before, in July, and was planning todo so again.]propaganda, which had for its object the counter-revolution, soardently desired by the Dark Forces, he went on:"I am a doomed man, it doesn't matter what happens to me, and I havethe audacity to say that the other enigmatic part is that of theunbelievable provocation created in the city by the Bolsheviki!"On November 2d only fifteen delegates to the Congress of Soviets hadarrived. Next day there were a hundred, and the morning after that ahundred and seventy-five, of whom one hundred and three wereBolsheviki.... Four hundred constituted a quorum, and the Congress wasonly three days off....I spent a great deal of time at Smolny. It was no longer easy to getin. Double rows of sentries guarded the outer gates, and once insidethe front door there was a long line of people waiting to be let in,four at a time, to be questioned as to their identity and theirbusiness. Passes were given out, and the pass system was changedevery few hours; for spies continually sneaked through....[Graphic page-49  Russian Pass to Reed, translation follows]Pass to Smolny Institute, issued by the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, giving me the right of entry at any time.

Commandant                               AdjutantOne day as I came up to the outer gate I saw Trotzky and his wifejust ahead of me. They were halted by a soldier. Trotzky searchedthrough his pockets, but could find no pass."Never mind," he said finally. "You know me. My name is Trotzky.""You haven't got a pass," answered the soldier stubbornly."You cannot go in. Names don't mean anything to me.""But I am the president of the Petrograd Soviet.""Well," replied the soldier, "if you're as important a fellow as thatyou must at least have one little paper."Trotzky was very patient. "Let me see the Commandant," he said. Thesoldier hesitated, grumbling something about not wanting to disturbthe Commandant for every devil that came along. He beckoned finallyto the soldier in command of the guard. Trotzky explained matters tohim. "My name is Trotzky," he repeated."Trotzky?" The other soldier scratched his head. "I've heard the namesomewhere," he said at length. "I guess it's all right. You can go onin, comrade...."In the corridor I met Karakhan, member of the Bolshevik CentralCommittee, who explained to me what the new Government would be like."A loose organisation, sensitive to the popular will as expressedthrough the Soviets, allowing local forces full play. At present theProvisional Government obstructs the action of the local democraticwill, just as the Tsar's Government did. The initiative of the newsociety shall come from below.... The form of the Government will bemodelled on the Constitution of the Russian Social Democratic LabourParty. The new _Tsay-ee-kah,_ responsible to frequent meetings of theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets, will be the parliament; the variousMinistries will be headed by _collegia_-committees-instead of byMinisters, and will be directly responsible to the Soviets....On October 30th, by appointment, I went up to a small, bare room inthe attic of Smolny, to talk with Trotzky. In the middle of the roomhe sat on a rough chair at a bare table. Few questions from me werenecessary; he talked rapidly and steadily, for more than an hour. Thesubstance of his talk, in his own words, I give here:"The Provisional Government is absolutely powerless. The bourgeoisieis in control, but this control is masked by a fictitious coalitionwith the _oborontsi_ parties. Now, during the Revolution, one seesrevolts of peasants who are tired of waiting for their promised land;and all over the country, in all the toiling classes, the samedisgust is evident. This domination by the bourgeoisie is onlypossible by means of civil war. The Kornilov method is the only wayby which the bourgeoisie can control. But it is force which thebourgeoisie lacks.... The Army is with us. The conciliators andpacifists, Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki, have lost allauthority-because the struggle between the peasants and thelandlords, between the workers and the employers, between thesoldiers and the officers, has become more bitter, moreirreconcilable than ever. Only by the concerted action of the popularmass, only by the victory of proletarian dictatorship, can theRevolution be achieved and the people saved...."The Soviets are the most perfect representatives of thepeople-perfect in their revolutionary experience, in their ideas andobjects. Based directly upon the army in the trenches, the workers inthe factories, and the peasants in the fields, they are the backboneof the Revolution."There has been an attempt to create a power without the Soviets-andonly powerlessness has been created. Counter-revolutionary schemes ofall sorts are now being hatched in the corridors of the Council ofthe Russian Republic. The Cadet party represents thecounter-revolution militant. On the other side, the Soviets representthe cause of the people. Between the two camps there are no groups ofserious importance.... It is the _lutte finale._ The bourgeoiscounter-revolution organises all its forces and waits for the momentto attack us. Our answer will be decisive. We will complete the workscarcely begun in March, and advanced during the Kornilov affair...."He went on to speak of the new Government's foreign policy:"Our first act will be to call for an immediate armistice on allfronts, and a conference of peoples to discuss democratic peaceterms. The quantity of democracy we get in the peace settlementdepends on the quantity of revolutionary response there is in Europe.If we create here a Government of the Soviets, that will be apowerful factor for immediate peace in Europe; for this Governmentwill address itself directly and immediately to all peoples, over theheads of their Governments, proposing an armistice. At the moment ofthe conclusion of peace the pressure of the Russian Revolution willbe in the direction of 'no annexations,# no indemnities, the right ofself-determination of peoples,' and a _Federated Republic of Europe._..."At the end of this war I see Europe recreated, not by the diplomats,but by the proletariat. The Federated Republic of Europe-the UnitedStates of Europe-that is what must be. National autonomy no longersuffices. Economic evolution demands the abolition of nationalfrontiers. If Europe is to remain split into national groups, thenImperialism will recommence its work. Only a Federated Republic ofEurope can give peace to the world." He smiled-that fine, faintlyironical smile of his. "But without the action of the Europeanmasses, these ends cannot be realised-now...."Now while everybody was waiting for the Bolsheviki to appear suddenlyon the streets one morning and begin to shoot down people with whitecollars on, the real insurrection took its way quite naturally andopenly.The Provisional Government planned to send the Petrograd garrison tothe front.The Petrograd garrison numbered about sixty thousand men, who hadtaken a prominent part in the Revolution. It was they who had turnedthe tide in the great days of March, created the Soviets of Soldiers'Deputies, and hurled back Kornilov from the gates of Petrograd.Now a large part of them were Bolsheviki. When the ProvisionalGovernment talked of evacuating the city, it was the Petrogradgarrison which answered, "If you are not capable of defending thecapital, conclude peace; if you cannot conclude peace, go away andmake room for a People's Government which can do both...."It was evident that any attempt at insurrection depended upon theattitude of the Petrograd garrison. The Government's plan was toreplace the garrison regiments with "dependable" troops-Cossacks,Death Battalions. The Army Committees, the "moderate" Socialists andthe _Tsay-ee-kah_ supported the Government. A wide-spread agitationwas carried on at the Front and in Petrograd, emphasizing the factthat for eight months the Petrograd garrison had been leading an easylife in the barracks of the capital, while their exhausted comradesin the trenches starved and died.Naturally there was some truth in the accusation that the garrisonregiments were reluctant to exchange their comparative comfort forthe hardships of a winter campaign. But there were other reasons whythey refused to go. The Petrograd Soviet feared the Government'sintentions, and from the Front came hundreds of delegates, chosen bythe common soldiers, crying, "It is true we need reinforcements, butmore important, we must know that Petrograd and the Revolution arewell-guarded.... Do you hold the rear, comrades, and we will hold thefront!"On October 25th, behind closed doors, the Central Committee of thePetrograd Soviet discussed the formation of a special MilitaryCommittee to decide the whole question. The next day a meeting of theSoldiers' Section of the Petrograd Soviet elected a Committee, whichimmediately proclaimed a boycott of the bourgeois newspapers, andcondemned the _Tsay-ee-kah_ for opposing the Congress of Soviets. Onthe 29th, in open session of the Petrograd Soviet, Trotzky proposedthat the Soviet formally sanction the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. "We ought," he said, "to create our special organisationto march to battle, and if necessary to die...." It was decided to sendto the front two delegations, one from the Soviet and one from thegarrison, to confer with the Soldiers' Committees and the GeneralStaff.At Pskov, the Soviet delegates were met by General Tcheremissov,commander of the Northern Front, with the curt declaration that hehad ordered the Petrograd garrison to the trenches, and that was all.The garrison committee was not allowed to leave Petrograd....A delegation of the Soldiers' Section of the Petrograd Soviet askedthat a representative be admitted to the Staff of the PetrogradDistrict. Refused. The Petrograd Soviet demanded that no orders beissued without the approval of the Soldiers' Section. Refused. Thedelegates were roughly told, "We only recognise the _Tsay-ee-kah._ Wedo not recognise you; if you break any laws, we shall arrest you."On the 30th a meeting of representatives of all the Petrogradregiments passed a resolution: _"The Petrograd garrison no longerrecognises the Provisional Government. The Petrograd Soviet is ourGovernment. We will obey only the orders of the Petrograd Soviet,through the Military Revolutionary Committee."_ The local militaryunits were ordered to wait for instructions from the Soldiers'Section of the Petrograd Soviet.Next day the _Tsay-ee-kah_ summoned its own meeting, composed largelyof officers, formed a Committee to cooperate with the Staff, anddetailed Commissars in all quarters of the city.A great soldier meeting at Smolny on the 3d resolved:Saluting the creation of the Military Revolutionary Committee, thePetrograd garrison promises it complete support in all its actions,to unite more closely the front and the rear in the interests of theRevolution.The garrison moreover declares that with the revolutionaryproletariat it assures the maintenance of revolutionary order inPetrograd. Every attempt at provocation on the part of theKornilovtsi or the bourgeoisie will be met with merciless resistance.Now conscious of its power, the Military Revolutionary Committeeperemptorily summoned the Petrograd Staff to submit to its control.To all printing plants it gave orders not to publish any appeals orproclamations without the Committee's authorisation. Armed Commissarsvisited the Kronversk arsenal and seized great quantities of arms andammunition, halting a shipment of ten thousand bayonets which wasbeing sent to Novotcherkask, headquarters of Kaledin....Suddenly awake to the danger, the Government offered immunity if theCommittee would disband. Too late. At midnight November 5th Kerenskyhimself sent Malevsky to offer the Petrograd Soviet representation onthe Staff. The Military Revolutionary Committee accepted. An hourlater General Manikovsky, acting Minister of war, countermanded theoffer....Tuesday morning, November 6th, the city was thrown into excitement bythe appearance of a placard signed, "Military Revolutionary Committeeattached to the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies."To the Population of Petrograd. Citizens!Counter-revolution has raised its criminal head. The Kornilovtsi aremobilising their forces in order to crush the All-Russian Congress ofSoviets and break the Constituent Assembly. At the same time the_pogromists_ may attempt to call upon the people of Petrograd fortrouble and bloodshed. The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies takes upon itself the guarding of revolutionary order in thecity against counter-revolutionary and _pogrom_ attempts.The Petrograd garrison will not allow any violence or disorders. Thepopulation is invited to arrest hooligans and Black Hundred agitatorsand take them to the Soviet Commissars at the nearest barracks. Atthe first attempt of the Dark Forces to make trouble on the streetsof Petrograd, whether robbery or fighting, the criminals will bewiped off the face of the earth!Citizens! We call upon you to maintain complete quiet andself-possession. The cause of order and Revolution is in strong hands.List of regiments where there are Commissars of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee....On the 3rd the leaders of the Bolsheviki had another historic meetingbehind closed doors. Notified by Zalkind, I waited in the corridoroutside the door; and Volodarsky as he came out told me what wasgoing on.Lenin spoke: "November 6th will be too early. We must have anall-Russian basis for the rising; and on the 6th all the delegates tothe Congress will not have arrived.... On the other hand, November 8thwill be too late. By that time the Congress will be organised, and itis difficult for a large organised body of people to take swift,decisive action. We must act on the 7th, the day the Congress meets,so that we may say to it, 'Here is the power! What are you going todo with it?'"In a certain upstairs room sat a thin-faced, long-haired individual,once an officer in the armies of the Tsar, then revolutionist andexile, a certain Avseenko, called Antonov, mathematician andchess-player; he was drawing careful plans for the seizure of thecapital.On its side the Government was preparing. Inconspicuously certain ofthe most loyal regiments, from widely-separated divisions, wereordered to Petrograd. The _yunker_ artillery was drawn into theWinter Palace. Patrols of Cossacks made their appearance in thestreets, for the first time since the July days. Polkovnikov issuedorder after order, threatening to repress all insubordination withthe "utmost energy." Kishkin, Minister of Public Instruction, theworsthated member of the Cabinet, was appointed Special Commissar tokeep order in Petrograd; he named as assistants two men no lessunpopular, Rutenburg and Paltchinsky. Petrograd, Cronstadt andFinland were declared in a state of siege-upon which the bourgeois_Novoye Vremya_ (New Times) remarked ironically:Why the state of siege? The Government is no longer a power. It hasno moral authority and it does not possess the necessary apparatus touse force.... In the most favourable circumstances it can onlynegotiate with any one who consents to parley. Its authority goes nofarther....Monday morning, the 5th, I dropped in at the Marinsky Palace, to seewhat was happening in the Council of the Russian Republic. Bitterdebate on Terestchenko's foreign policy. Echoes of theBurtzev-Verkhovski affair. All the diplomats present except theItalian ambassador, who everybody said was prostrated by the Carsodisaster....As I came in, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Karelin was readingaloud an editorial from the London _Times_ which said, "The remedyfor Bolshevism is bullets!" Turning to the Cadets he cried, "That'swhat _you_ think, too!"Voices from the Right, "Yes! Yes!""Yes, I know you think so," answered Karelin, hotly. "But you haven'tthe courage to try it!"Then Skobeliev, looking like a matinée idol with his soft blond beardand wavy yellow hair, rather apologetically defending the Soviet_nakaz._ Terestchenko followed, assailed from the Left by cries of"Resignation! Resignation!" He insisted that the delegates of theGovernment and of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ to Paris should have a commonpoint of view-his own. A few words about the restoration ofdiscipline in the army, about war to victory.... Tumult, and over thestubborn opposition of the truculent Left, the Council of theRepublic passed to the simple order of the day.There stretched the rows of Bolshevik seats-empty since that firstday when they left the Council, carrying with them so much life. As Iwent down the stairs it seemed to me that in spite of the bitterwrangling, no real voice from the rough world outside could penetratethis high, cold hall, and that the Provisional Government waswrecked-on the same rock of War and Peace that had wrecked theMiliukov Ministry.... The doorman grumbled as he put on my coat, "Idon't know what is becoming of poor Russia. All these Mensheviki andBolsheviki and Trudoviki.... This Ukraine and this Finland and theGerman imperialists and the English imperialists. I am forty-fiveyears old, and in all my life I never heard so many words as in thisplace...."In the corridor I met Professor Shatsky, a rat-faced individual in adapper frock-coat, very influential in the councils of the Cadetparty. I asked him what he thought of the much-talked-of Bolshevik_vystuplennie._ He shrugged, sneering."They are cattle-_canaille,"_ he answered. "They will not dare, or ifthey dare they will soon be sent flying. From our point of view itwill not be bad, for then they will ruin themselves and have no powerin the Constituent Assembly...."But, my dear sir, allow me to outline to you my plan for a form ofGovernment to be submitted to the Constituent Assembly. You see, I amchairman of a commission appointed from this body, in conjunctionwith the Provisional Government, to work out a constitutionalproject.... We will have a legislative assembly of two chambers, suchas you have in the United States. In the lower chamber will beterritorial representatives; in the upper, representatives of theliberal professions, zemstvos, Cooperatives-and Trade Unions...."Outside a chill, damp wind came from the west, and the cold mudunderfoot soaked through my shoes. Two companies of _yunkers_ passedswinging up the Morskaya, tramping stiffly in their long coats andsinging an oldtime crashing chorus, such as the soldiers used to singunder the Tsar.... At the first cross-street I noticed that the CityMilitiamen were mounted, and armed with revolvers in bright newholsters; a little group of people stood silently staring at them. Atthe corner of the Nevsky I bought a pamphlet by Lenin, "Will theBolsheviki be Able to Hold the Power?" paying for it with one of thestamps which did duty for small change. The usual street-cars crawledpast, citizens and soldiers clinging to the outside in a way to makeTheodore P. Shonts green with envy.... Along the sidewalk a row ofdeserters in uniform sold cigarettes and sunflower seeds....Up the Nevsky in the sour twilight crowds were battling for thelatest papers, and knots of people were trying to make out themultitudes of appeals (See App. III, Sect. 6) and proclamationspasted in every flat place; from the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the Peasants'Soviets, the "moderate" Socialist parties, the ArmyCommittees-threatening, cursing, beseeching the workers and soldiersto stay home, to support the Government....An armoured automobile went slowly up and down, siren screaming. Onevery corner, in every open space, thick groups were clustered;arguing soldiers and students. Night came swiftly down, thewide-spaced street-lights flickered on, the tides of people flowedendlessly.... It is always like that in Petrograd just before trouble....The city was nervous, starting at every sharp sound. But still nosign from the Bolsheviki; the soldiers stayed in the barracks, theworkmen in the factories.... We went to a moving picture show near theKazan Cathedral-a bloody Italian film of passion and intrigue. Downfront were some soldiers and sailors, staring at the screen inchildlike wonder, totally unable to comprehend why there should be somuch violent running about, and so much homicide....From there I hurried to Smolny. In room 10 on the top floor, theMilitary Revolutionary Committee sat in continuous session, under thechairmanship of a tow-headed, eighteen-year-old boy named Lazimir. Hestopped, as he passed, to shake hands rather bashfully."Peter-Paul Fortress has just come over to us," said he, with apleased grin. "A minute ago we got word from a regiment that wasordered by the Government to come to Petrograd. The men weresuspicious, so they stopped the train at Gatchina and sent adelegation to us. 'What's the matter?' they asked. 'What have you gotto say? We have just passed a resolution, "All Power to theSoviets."'... The Military Revolutionary Committee sent back word,'Brothers! We greet you in the name of the Revolution. Stay where youare until further instructions!'"All telephones, he said, were cut off: but communication with thefactories and barracks was established by means of militarytelephonograph apparatus....A steady stream of couriers and Commissars came and went. Outside thedoor waited a dozen volunteers, ready to carry word to the farthestquarters of the city. One of them, a gypsy-faced man in the uniformof a lieutenant, said in French, "Everything is ready to move at thepush of a button...."There passed Podvoisky, the thin, bearded civillian whose brainconceived the strategy of insurrection; Antonov, unshaven, his collarfilthy, drunk with loss of sleep; Krylenko, the squat, wide-facedsoldier, always smiling, with his violent gestures and tumblingspeech; and Dybenko, the giant bearded sailor with the placid face.These were the men of the hour-and of other hours to come.Downstairs in the office of the Factory-Shop Committees sat Seratov,signing orders on the Government Arsenal for arms-one hundred andfifty rifles for each factory.... Delegates waited in line, forty ofthem....In the hall I ran into some of the minor Bolshevik leaders. Oneshowed me a revolver. "The game is on," he said, and his face waspale. "Whether we move or not the other side knows it must finish usor be finished...."The Petrograd Soviet was meeting day and night. As I came into thegreat hall Trotzky was just finishing."We are asked," he said, "if we intend to have a _vystuplennie._ Ican give a clear answer to that question. The Petrograd Soviet feelsthat at last the moment has arrived when the power must fall into thehands of the Soviets. This transfer of government will beaccomplished by the All-Russian Congress. Whether an armeddemonstration is necessary will depend on... those who wish tointerfere with the All-Russian Congress...."We feel that our Government, entrusted to the personnel of theProvisional Cabinet, is a pitiful and helpless Government, which onlyawaits the sweep of the broom of History to give way to a reallypopular Government. But we are trying to avoid a conflict, even now,to-day. We hope that the All-Russian Congress will take... into itshands that power and authority which rests upon the organised freedomof the people. If, however, the Government wants to utilise the shortperiod it is expected to live-twenty-four, forty eight, orseventy-two hours-to attack us, then we shall answer withcounter-attacks, blow for blow, steel for iron!"Amid cheers he announced that the Left Socialist Revolutionaries hadagreed to send representatives into the Military RevolutionaryCommittee....As I left Smolny, at three o'clock in the morning, I noticed that tworapid-firing guns had been mounted, one on each side of the door, andthat strong patrols of soldiers guarded the gates and the near-bystreet-corners. Bill Shatov [*] came bounding up the steps. "Well," he[* Well known in the American labor movement.]cried, "We're off! Kerensky sent the _yunkers_ to close down ourpapers, _Soldat_ and _Rabotchi Put._ But our troops went down andsmashed the Government seals, and now we're sending detachments toseize the bourgeois newspaper offices!" Exultantly he slapped me onthe shoulder, and ran in....On the morning of the 6th I had business with the censor, whoseoffice was in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Everywhere, on all thewalls, hysterical appeals to the people to remain "calm." Polkovnikovemitted _prikaz_ after _prikaz:_I order all military units and detachments to remain in theirbarracks until further orders from the Staff of the MilitaryDistrict.... All officers who act without orders from their superiorswill be court-martialled for mutiny. I forbid absolutely anyexecution by soldiers of instructions from other organisations....The morning papers announced that the Government had suppressed thepapers _Novaya Rus, Zhivoye Slovo, Rabotchi Put_ and _Soldat,_ anddecreed the arrest of the leaders of the Petrograd Soviet and themembers of the Military Revolutionary Committee....As I crossed the Palace Square several batteries of _yunker_artillery came through the Red Arch at a jingling trot, and drew upbefore the Palace. The great red building of the General Staff wasunusually animated, several armoured automobiles ranked before thedoor, and motors full of officers were coming and going.... The censorwas very much excited, like a small boy at a circus. Kerensky, hesaid, had just gone to the Council of the Republic to offer hisresignation. I hurried down to the Marinsky Palace, arriving at theend of that passionate and almost incoherent speech of Kerensky's,full of self-justification and bitter denunciation of his enemies."I will cite here the most characteristic passage from a whole seriesof articles published in _Rabotchi Put_ by Ulianov-Lenin, a statecriminal who is in hiding and whom we are trying to find.... This statecriminal has invited the proletariat and the Petrograd garrison torepeat the experience of the 16th-18th of July, and insists upon theimmediate necessity for an armed rising.... Moreover, other Bolshevikleaders have taken the floor in a series of meetings, and also madean appeal to immediate insurrection. Particularly should be noticedthe activity of the present president of the Petrograd Soviet,Bronstein-Trotzky...."I ought to bring to your notice... that the expressions and the styleof a whole series of articles in _Rabotchi Put_ and _Soldat_ resembleabsolutely those of _Novaya Rus...._ We have to do not so much with themovement of such and such political party, as with the exploitationof the political ignorance and criminal instincts of a part of thepopulation, a sort of organisation whose object it is to provoke inRussia, cost what it may, an inconscient movement of destruction andpillage; for given the state of mind of the masses, any movement atPetrograd will be followed by the most terrible massacres, which willcover with eternal shame the name of free Russia...."... By the admission of Ulianov-Lenin himself, the situation of theextreme left wing of the Social Democrats in Russia is veryfavourable." (Here Kerensky read the following quotation from Lenin'sarticle.):Think of it!... The German comrades have only one Liebknecht, withoutnewspapers, without freedom of meeting, without a Soviet.... They areopposed by the incredible hostility of all classes of society-and yetthe German comrades try to act; while we, having dozens ofnewspapers, freedom of meeting, the majority of the Soviets, we, thebest-placed international proletarians of the entire world, can werefuse to support the German revolutionists and insurrectionaryorganisations?...Kerensky then continued:"The organisers of rebellion recognise thus implicitly that the mostperfect conditions for the free action of a political party obtainnow in Russia, administered by a Provisional Government at the headof which is, in the eyes of this party, 'a usurper and a man who hassold himself to the bourgeoisie, the Minister-President Kerensky....'"... The organisers of the insurrection do not come to the aid of theGerman proletariat, but of the German governing classes, and theyopen the Russian front to the iron fists of Wilhelm and his friends....Little matter to the Provisional Government the motives of thesepeople, little matter if they act consciously or unconsciously; butin any case, from this tribune, in full consciousness of myresponsibility, I quality such acts of a Russian political party asacts of treason to Russia!"... I place myself at the point of view of the Right, and I proposeimmediately to proceed to an investigation and make the necessaryarrests." (Uproar from the Left.) "Listen to me!" he cried in apowerful voice. "At the moment when the state is in danger, becauseof conscious or unconscious treason, the Provisional Government, andmyself among others, prefer to be killed rather than betray the life,the honour and the independence of Russia...."At this moment a paper was handed to Kerensky."I have just received the proclamation which they are distributing tothe regiments. Here is the contents." Reading: _"'The PetrogradSoviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies is menaced. We orderimmediately the regiments to mobilise on a war footing and to awaitnew orders. All delay or non-execution of this order will beconsidered as an act of treason to the Revolution. The MilitaryRevolutionary Committee. For the President, Podvoisky. The Secretary,Antonov.'_"In reality, this is an attempt to raise the populace against theexisting order of things, to break the Constituent and to open thefront to the regiments of the iron fist of Wilhelm...."I say 'populace' intentionally, because the conscious democracy andits _Tsay-ee-kah,_ all the Army organisations, all that free Russiaglorifies, the good sense, the honour and the conscience of the greatRussian democracy, protests against these things...."I have not come here with a prayer, but to state my firm convictionthat the Provisional Government, which defends at this moment our newliberty-that the new Russian state, destined to a brilliant future,will find unanimous support except among those who have never daredto face the truth...."... The Provisional Government has never violated the liberty of allcitizens of the State to use their political rights.... But now theProvisional Government.... declares: in this moment those elements ofthe Russian nation, those groups and parties who have dared to lifttheir hands against the free will of the Russian people, at the sametime threatening to open the front to Germany, must be liquidatedwith decision!..."Let the population of Petrograd understand that it will encounter afirm power, and perhaps at the last moment good sense, conscience andhonour will triumph in the hearts of those who still possess them...."All through this speech, the hall rang with deafening clamour. Whenthe Minister-President had stepped down, pale-faced and wet withperspiration, and strode out with his suite of officers, speakerafter speaker from the Left and Centre attacked the Right, all oneangry roaring. Even the Socialist Revolutionaries, through Gotz:"The policy of the Bolsheviki is demagogic and criminal, in theirexploitation of the popular discontent. But there is a whole seriesof popular demands which have received no satisfaction up to now....The questions of peace, land and the democratization of the armyought to be stated in such a fashion that no soldier, peasant orworker would have the least doubt that our Government is attempting,firmly and infallibly, to solve them...."We Mensheviki do not wish to provoke a Cabinet crisis, and we areready to defend the Provisional Government with all our energy, tothe last drop of our blood-if only the Provisional Government, on allthese burning questions, will speak the clear and precise wordsawaited by the people with such impatience...."Then Martov, furious:"The words of the Minister-President, who allowed himself to speak of'populace' when it is question of the movement of important sectionsof the proletariat and the army-although led in the wrongdirection-are nothing but an incitement to civil war."The order of the day proposed by the Left was voted. It amountedpractically to a vote of lack of confidence.1. The armed demonstration which has been preparing for some dayspast has for its object a _coup d'etat,_ threatens to provoke civilwar, creates conditions favourable to _pogroms_ andcounterrevolution, the mobilization of counter-revolutionary forces,such as the Black Hundreds, which will inevitably bring about theimpossibility of convoking the Constituent, will cause a militarycatastrophe, the death of the Revolution, paralyse the economic lifeof the country and destroy Russia;2. The conditions favourable to this agitation have been created bydelay in passing urgent measures, as well as objective conditionscaused by the war and the general disorder. It is necessary beforeeverything to promulgate at once a decree transmitting the land tothe peasants' Land Committees, and to adopt an energetic course ofaction abroad in proposing to the Allies to proclaim their peaceterms and to begin peace-parleys;3. To cope with Monarchist manifestations and _pogromist_ movements,it is indispensable to take immediate measures to suppress thesemovements, and for this purpose to create at Petrograd a Committee ofPublic Safety, composed of representatives of the Municipality andthe organs of the revolutionary democracy, acting in contact with theProvisional Government....It is interesting to note that the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries all rallied to this resolution.... When Kerensky sawit, however, he summoned Avksentiev to the Winter Palace to explain.If it expressed a lack of confidence in the Provisional Government,he begged Avksentiev to form a new Cabinet. Dan, Gotz and Avksentiev,the leaders of the "compromisers," performed their last compromise....They explained to Kerensky that it was not meant as a criticism ofthe Government!At the corner of the Morskaya and the Nevsky, squads of soldiers withfixed bayonets were stopping all private automobiles, turning out theoccupants, and ordering them toward the Winter Palace. A large crowdhad gathered to watch them. Nobody knew whether the soldiers belongedto the Government or the Military Revolutionary Committee. Up infront of the Kazan Cathedral the same thing was happening, machinesbeing directed back up the Nevsky. Five or six sailors with riflescame along, laughing excitedly, and fell into conversation with twoof the soldiers. On the sailors' hat bands were _Avrora_ and _ZariaSvobody,_-the names of the leading Bolshevik cruisers of the BalticFleet. One of them said, "Cronstadt is coming!"... It was as if, in1792, on the streets of Paris, some one had said: "The Marseillaisare coming!" For at Cronstadt were twenty-five thousand sailors,convinced Bolsheviki and not afraid to die...._Rabotchi i Soldat_ was just out, all its front page one hugeproclamation: SOLDIERS! WORKERS! CITIZENS!The enemies of the people passed last night to the offensive. TheKornilovists of the Staff are trying to draw in from the suburbs_yunkers_ and volunteer battalions. The Oranienbaum _yunkers_ and theTsarskoye Selo volunteers refused to come out. A stroke of hightreason is being contemplated against the Petrograd Soviet.... Thecampaign of the counter-revolutionists is being directed against theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets on the eve of its opening, againstthe Constituent Assembly, against the people. The Petrograd Soviet isguarding the Revolution. The Military Revolutionary Committee isdirecting the repulse of the conspirators' attack. The entiregarrison and proletariat of Petrograd are ready to deal the enemy ofthe people a crushing blow.The Military Revolutionary Committee decrees:1. All regimental, division and battle-ship Committees, together withthe Soviet Commissars, and all revolutionary organisations, shallmeet in continuous session, concentrating in their hands allinformation about the plans of the conspirators.2. Not one soldier shall leave his division without permission of theCommittee.3. To send to Smolny at once two delegates from each military unitand five from each Ward Soviet.4. All members of the Petrograd Soviet and all delegates to theAll-Russian Congress are invited immediately to Smolny for anextraordinary meeting.Counter-revolution has raised its criminal head.A great danger threatens all the conquests and hopes of the soldiersand workers.But the forces of the Revolution by far exceed those of its enemies.The cause of the People is in strong hands. The conspirators will becrushed.No hesitation or doubts! Firmness, steadfastness, discipline,determination!Long live the Revolution!_The Military Revolutionary Committee._The Petrograd Soviet was meeting continuously at Smolny, a centre ofstorm, delegates falling down asleep on the floor and rising again totake part in the debate, Trotzky, Kameniev, Volodarsky speaking six,eight, twelve hours a day....I went down to room 18 on the first floor where the Bolshevikdelegates were holding caucus, a harsh voice steadily booming, thespeaker hidden by the crowd: "The compromisers say that we areisolated. Pay no attention to them. Once it begins they must bedragged along with us, or else lose their following...."Here he held up a piece of paper. "We are dragging them! A messagehas just come from the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries! Theysay that they condemn our action, but that if the Government attacksus they will not oppose the cause of the proletariat!" Exultantshouting....As night fell the great hall filled with soldiers and workmen, amonstrous dun mass, deep-humming in a blue haze of smoke. The old_Tsay-ee-kah_ had finally decided to welcome the delegates to thatnew Congress which would mean its own ruin-and perhaps the ruin ofthe revolutionary order it had built. At this meeting, however, onlymembers of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ could vote....It was after midnight when Gotz took the chair and Dan rose to speak,in a tense silence, which seemed to me almost menacing."The hours in which we live appear in the most tragic colours," hesaid. "The enemy is at the gates of Petrograd, the forces of thedemocracy are trying to organise to resist him, and yet we awaitbloodshed in the streets of the capital, and famine threatens todestroy, not only our homogeneous Government, but the Revolutionitself...."The masses are sick and exhausted. They have no interest in theRevolution. If the Bolsheviki start anything, that will be the end ofthe Revolution..." (Cries, "That's a lie!)" "The counter-revolutionistsare waiting with the Bolsheviki to begin riots and massacres.... Ifthere is any _vystuplennie,_ there will be no Constituent Assembly...."(Cries, "Lie! Shame!")"It is inadmissible that in the zone of military operations thePetrograd garrison shall not submit to the orders of the Staff.... Youmust obey the orders of the Staff and of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ elected byyou. All Power to the Soviets-that means death! Robbers and thievesare waiting for the moment to loot and burn.... When you have suchslogans put before you, 'Enter the houses, take away the shoes andclothes from the bourgeoisie-'" (Tumult. Cries, "No such slogan! Alie! A lie!") "Well, it may start differently, but it will end thatway!"The _Tsay-ee-kah_ has full power to act, and must be obeyed.... We arenot afraid of bayonets.... The _Tsay-ee-kah_ will defend the Revolutionwith its body...." (Cries, "It was a dead body long ago!")Immense continued uproar, in which his voice could be heardscreaming, as he pounded the desk, "Those who are urging this arecommitting a crime!"Voice: "You committed a crime long ago, when you captured the powerand turned it over to the bourgeoisie!"Gotz, ringing the chairman's bell: "Silence, or I'll have you putout!"Voice: "Try it!" (Cheers and whistling.)"Now concerning our policy about peace." (Laughter.) "UnfortunatelyRussia can no longer support the continuation of the war. There isgoing to be peace, but not permanent peace-not a democratic peace....To-day, at the Council of the Republic, in order to avoid bloodshed,we passed an order of the day demanding the surrender of the land tothe Land Committees and immediate peace negotiations...." (Laughter,and cries, "Too late!")Then for the Bolsheviki, Trotzky mounted the tribune, borne on a waveof roaring applause that burst into cheers and a rising house,thunderous. His thin, pointed face was positively Mephistophelian inits expression of malicious irony."Dan's tactics prove that the masses-the great, dull, indifferentmasses-are absolutely with him!" (Titantic mirth.) He turned towardthe chairman, dramatically. "When we spoke of giving the land to thepeasants, you were against it. We told the peasants, 'If they don'tgive it to you, take it yourselves!' and the peasants followed ouradvice. And now you advocate what we did six months ago...."I don't think Kerensky's order to suspend the death penalty in thearmy was dictated by his ideals. I think Kerensky was persuaded bythe Petrograd garrison, which refused to obey him...."To-day Dan is accused of having made a speech in the Council of theRepublic which proves him to be a secret Bolshevik.... The time maycome when Dan will say that the flower of the Revolution participatedin the rising of July 16th and 18th.... In Dan's resolution to-day atthe Council of the Republic there was no mention of enforcingdiscipline in the army, although that is urged in the propaganda ofhis party...."No. The history of the last seven months shows that the masses haveleft the Mensheviki. The Mensheviki and the Socialist Revolutionariesconquered the Cadets, and then when they got the power, they gave itto the Cadets...."Dan tells you that you have no right to make an insurrection.Insurrection is the right of all revolutionists! When thedown-trodden masses revolt, it is their right...."Then the long-faced, cruel-tongued Lieber, greeted with groans andlaughter."Engels and Marx said that the proletariat had no right to take poweruntil it was ready for it. In a bourgeois revolution like this.... theseizure of power by the masses means the tragic end of theRevolution.... Trotzky, as a Social Democratic theorist, is himselfopposed to what he is now advocating...." (Cries, "Enough! Down withhim!")Martov, constantly interrupted: "The Internationalists are notopposed to the transmission of power to the democracy, but theydisapprove of the methods of the Bolsheviki. This is not the momentto seize the power...."Again Dan took the floor, violently protesting against the action ofthe Military Revolutionary Committee, which had sent a Commissar toseize the office of _Izviestia_ and censor the paper. The wildestuproar followed. Martov tried to speak, but could not be heard.Delegates of the Army and the Baltic Fleet stood up all over thehall, shouting that the Soviet was _their_ Government....Amid the wildest confusion Ehrlich offered a resolution, appealing tothe workers and soldiers to remain calm and not to respond toprovocations to demonstrate, recognising the necessity of immediatelycreating a Committee of Public Safety, and asking the ProvisionalGovernment at once to pass decrees transferring the land to thepeasants and beginning peace negotiations....Then up leaped Volodarsky, shouting harshly that the _Tsay-ee-kah,_on the eve of the Congress, had no right to assume the functions ofthe Congress. The _Tsay-ee-kah_ was practically dead, he said, andthe resolution was simply a trick to bolster up its waning power...."As for us, Bolsheviki, we will not vote on this resolution!"Whereupon all the Bolsheviki left the hall and the resolution waspassed....Toward four in the morning I met Zorin in the outer hall, a rifleslung from his shoulder."We're moving!" (See App. III, Sect. 7) said he, calmly but withsatisfaction. "We pinched the Assistant Minister of Justice and theMinister of Religions. They're down cellar now. One regiment is onthe march to capture the Telephone Exchange, another the TelegraphAgency, another the State Bank. The Red Guard is out...."On the steps of Smolny, in the chill dark, we first saw the RedGuard-a huddled group of boys in workmen's clothes, carrying gunswith bayonets, talking nervously together.Far over the still roofs westward came the sound of scattered riflefire, where the _yunkers_ were trying to open the bridges over theNeva, to prevent the factory workers and soldiers of the Viborgquarter from joining the Soviet forces in the centre of the city; andthe Cronstadt sailors were closing them again....Behind us great Smolny, bright with lights, hummed like a gigantichive....                              Chapter IV                    The Fall of the Provisional GovernmentWEDNESDAY, November 7th, I rose very late. The noon cannon boomedfrom Peter-Paul as I went down the Nevsky. It was a raw, chill day.In front of the State Bank some soldiers with fixed bayonets werestanding at the closed gates."What side do you belong to?" I asked. "The Government?""No more Government," one answered with a grin, "_Slava Bogu!_ Gloryto God!" That was all I could get out of him....The street-cars were running on the Nevsky, men, women and smallboys hanging on every projection. Shops were open, and there seemedeven less uneasiness among the street crowds than there had been theday before. A whole crop of new appeals against insurrection hadblossomed out on the walls during the night-to the peasants, to thesoldiers at the front, to the workmen of Petrograd. One read:FROM THE PETROGRAD MUNICIPAL DUMA:The Municipal Duma informs the citizens that in the extraordinarymeeting of November 6th the Duma formed a Committee of PublicSafety, composed of members of the Central and Ward Dumas, andrepresentatives of the following revolutionary democraticorganizations: The _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the All-Russian ExecutiveCommittee of Peasant Deputies, the Army organisations, the_Tsentroflot,_ the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies (!), the Council of Trade Unions, and others.Members of the Committee of Public Safety will be on duty in thebuilding of the Municipal Duma. Telephones No. 15-40, 223-77, 138-36.November 7th, 1917.Though I didn't realize it then, this was the Duma's declaration ofwar against the Bolsheviki.I bought a copy of _Rabotchi Put,_ the only newspaper which seemedon sale, and a little later paid a soldier fifty kopeks for asecond-hand copy of _Dien._ The Bolshevik paper, printed onlarge-sized sheets in the conquered office of the _Russkaya Volia,_had huge headlines: "ALL POWER-TO THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS, SOLDIERSAND PEASANTS! PEACE! BREAD! LAND!" The leading article was signed"Zinoviev,"-Lenin's companion in hiding. It began:Every soldier, every worker, every real Socialist, every honestdemocrat realises that there are only two alternatives to thepresent situation.Either-the power will remain in the hands of the bourgeois-landlordcrew, and this will mean every kind of repression for the workers,soldiers and peasants, continuation of the war, inevitable hungerand death....Or-the power will be transferred to the hands of the revolutionaryworkers, soldiers and peasants; and in that case it will mean acomplete abolition of landlord tyranny, immediate check of thecapitalists, immediate proposal of a just peace. Then the land isassured to the peasants, then control of industry is assured to theworkers, then bread is assured to the hungry, then the end of thisnonsensical war!..._Dien_ contained fragmentary news of the agitated night. Bolshevikicapture of the Telephone Exchange, the Baltic station, the TelegraphAgency; the Peterhof _yunkers_ unable to reach Petrograd; theCossacks undecided; arrest of some of the Ministers; shooting ofChief of the City Militia Meyer;  arrests, counter-arrests,skirmishes between clashing patrols of soldiers, _yunkers_ and RedGuards. (See App. IV, Sect. 1)On the corner of the Morskaya I ran into Captain Gomberg, Menshevik_oboronetz,_ secretary of the Military Section of his party. When Iasked him if the insurrection had really happened he shrugged hisshoulders in a tired manner and replied, "_Tchort znayet!_ The devilknows! Well, perhaps the Bolsheviki can seize the power, but theywon't be able to hold it more than three days. They haven't the mento run a government. Perhaps it's a good thing to let them try-thatwill furnish them...."The Military Hotel at the corner of St. Isaac's Square was picketedby armed sailors. In the lobby were many of the smart youngofficers, walking up and down or muttering together; the sailorswouldn't let them leave....Suddenly came the sharp crack of a rifle outside, followed by ascattered burst of firing. I ran out. Something unusual was going onaround the Marinsky Palace, where the Council of the RussianRepublic met. Diagonally across the wide square was drawn a line ofsoldiers, rifles ready, staring at the hotel roof."_Provacatzia!_ Shot at us!" snapped one, while another went runningtoward the door.At the western corner of the Palace lay a big armoured car with ared flag flying from it, newly lettered in red paint: "S.R.S.D."(_Soviet Rabotchikh Soldatskikh Deputatov_); all the guns trainedtoward St. Isaac's. A barricade had been heaped up across the mouthof Novaya Ulitza-boxes, barrels, an old bed-spring, a wagon. A pileof lumber barred the end of the Moika quay. Short logs from aneighbouring wood-pile were being built up along the front of thebuilding to form breastworks...."Is there going to be any fighting?" I asked."Soon, soon," answered a soldier, nervously. "Go away, comrade,you'll get hurt. They will come from that direction," pointingtoward the Admiralty."Who will?""That I couldn't tell you, brother," he answered, and spat.Before the door of the Palace was a crowd of soldiers and sailors. Asailor was telling of the end of the Council of the RussianRepublic. "We walked in there," he said, "and filled all the doorswith comrades. I went up to the counter-revolutionist Kornilovitzwho sat in the president's chair. 'No more Council,' I says. 'Runalong home now!"'                                                    |There was laughter. By waving assorted papers I managed to getaround to the door of the press gallery. There an enormous smilingsailor stopped me, and when I showed my pass, just said, "If youwere Saint Michael himself, comrade, you couldn't pass here!"Through the glass of the door I made out the distorted face andgesticulating arms of a French correspondent, locked in....Around in front stood a little, grey-moustached man in the uniformof a general, the centre of a knot of soldiers. He was very red inthe face."I am General Alexeyev," he cried. "As your superior officer and asa member of the Council of the Republic I demand to be allowed topass!" The guard scratched his head, looking uneasily out of thecorner of his eye; he beckoned to an approaching officer, who grewvery agitated when he saw who it was and saluted before he realisedwhat he was doing."_Vashe Vuisokoprevoskhoditelstvo_-your High Excellency-" hestammered, in the manner of the old régime, "Access to the Palace isstrictly forbidden--I have no right-"An automobile came by, and I saw Gotz sitting inside, laughingapparently with great amusement. A few minutes later another, witharmed soldiers on the front seat, full of arrested members of theProvisional Government. Peters, Lettish member of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee, came hurrying across the Square."I thought you bagged all those gentlemen last night," said I,pointing to them."Oh," he answered, with the expression of a disappointed small boy."The damn fools let most of them go again before we made up ourminds...."Down the Voskressensky Prospect a great mass of sailors were drawnup, and behind them came marching soldiers, as far as the eye couldreach.We went toward the Winter Palace by way of the Admiralteisky. Allthe entrances to the Palace Square were closed by sentries, and acordon of troops stretched clear across the western end, besieged byan uneasy throng of citizens. Except for far-away soldiers whoseemed to be carrying wood out of the Palace courtyard and piling itin front of the main gateway, everything was quiet.We couldn't make out whether the sentries were pro-Government orpro-Soviet. Our papers from Smolny had no effect, however, so weapproached another part of the line with an important air and showedour American passports, saying "Official business!" and shoulderedthrough. At the door of the Palace the same old _shveitzari,_ intheir brass-buttoned blue uniforms with the red-and-gold collars,politely took our coats and hats, and we went up-stairs. In thedark, gloomy corridor, stripped of its tapestries, a few oldattendants were lounging about, and in front of Kerensky's door ayoung officer paced up and down, gnawing his moustache. We asked ifwe could interview the Minister-president. He bowed and clicked hisheels."No, I am sorry," he replied in French. "Alexander Feodorvitch isextremely occupied just now...." He looked at us for a moment. "Infact, he is not here....""Where is he?""He has gone to the Front. (See App. IV, Sect. 2) And do you know,there wasn't enough gasoline for his automobile. We had to send tothe English Hospital and borrow some.""Are the Ministers here?""They are meeting in some room-I don't know where.'"Are the Bolsheviki coming?""Of course. Certainly, they are coming. I expect a telephone callevery minute to say that they are coming. But we are ready. We have_yunkers_ in the front of the Palace. Through that door there.""Can we go in there?""No. Certainly not. It is not permitted." Abruptly he shook handsall around and walked away. We turned to the forbidden door, set ina temporary partition dividing the hall and locked on the outside.On the other side were voices, and somebody laughing. Except forthat the vast spaces of the old Palace were silent as the grave. Anold _shveitzar_ ran up. "No, _barin,_ you must not go in there.""Why is the door locked?""To keep the soldiers in," he answered. After a few minutes he saidsomething about having a glass of tea and went back up the hall. Weunlocked the door.Just inside a couple of soldiers stood on guard, but they saidnothing. At the end of the corridor was a large, ornate room withgilded cornices and enormous crystal lustres, and beyond it severalsmaller ones, wainscoted with dark wood. On both sides of theparquetted floor lay rows of dirty mattresses and blankets, uponwhich occasional soldiers were stretched out; everywhere was alitter of cigarette-butts, bits of bread, cloth, and empty bottleswith expensive French labels. More and more soldiers, with the redshoulder-straps of the _yunker_-schools, moved about in a staleatmosphere of tobacco-smoke and unwashed humanity. One had a bottleof white Burgundy, evidently filched from the cellars of the Palace.They looked at us with astonishment as we marched past, through roomafter room, until at last we came out into a series of greatstate-salons, fronting their long and dirty windows on the Square.The walls were covered with huge canvases in massive giltframes-historical battle-scenes.... "12 October 1812" and "6 November1812" and "16/28 August 1813." ... One had a gash across the upperright hand corner.The place was all a huge barrack, and evidently had been for weeks,from the look of the floor and walls. Machine guns were mounted onwindow-sills, rifles stacked between the mattresses.As we were looking at the pictures an alcoholic breath assailed mefrom the region of my left ear, and a voice said in thick but fluentFrench, "I see, by the way you admire the paintings, that you areforeigners." He was a short, puffy man with a baldish head as heremoved his cap."Americans? Enchanted. I am Stabs-Capitan Vladimir Artzibashev,absolutely at your service." It did not seem to occur to him thatthere was anything unusual in four strangers, one a woman, wanderingthrough the defences of an army awaiting attack. He began tocomplain of the state of Russia."Not only these Bolsheviki," he said, "but the fine traditions ofthe Russian army are broken down. Look around you. These are allstudents in the officers' training schools. But are they gentlemen?Kerensky opened the officers' schools to the ranks, to any soldierwho could pass an examination. Naturally there are many, many whoare contaminated by the Revolution...."Without consequence he changed the subject. "I am very anxious to goaway from Russia. I have made up my mind to join the American army.Will you please go to your Consul and make arrangements? I will giveyou my address." In spite of our protestations he wrote it on apiece of paper, and seemed to feel better at once. I have itstill-"_Oranien-baumskaya Shkola Praporshtchikov 2nd, StarayaPeterhof._""We had a review this morning early," he went on, as he guided usthrough the rooms and explained everything. "The Women's Battaliondecided to remain loyal to the Government.""Are the women soldiers in the Palace?""Yes, they are in the back rooms, where they won't be hurt if anytrouble comes." He sighed. "It is a great responsibility," said he.For a while we stood at the window, looking down on the Squarebefore the Palace, where three companies of long-coated _yunkers_were drawn up under arms, being harangued by a tall,energetic-looking officer I recognised as Stankievitch, chiefMilitary Commissar of the Provisional Government. After a fewminutes two of the companies shouldered arms with a clash, barkedthree sharp shouts, and went swinging off across the Square,disappearing through the Red Arch into the quiet city."They are going to capture the Telephone Exchange," said some one.Three cadets stood by us, and we fell into conversation. They saidthey had entered the schools from the ranks, and gave theirnames-Robert Olev, Alexei Vasilienko and Erni Sachs, an Esthonian.But now they didn't want to be officers any more, because officerswere very unpopular. They didn't seem to know what to do, as amatter of fact, and it was plain that they were not happy.But soon they began to boast. "If the Bolsheviki come we shall showthem how to fight. They do not dare to fight, they are cowards. Butif we should be overpowered, well, every man keeps one bullet forhimself...."At this point there was a burst of rifle-fire not far off. Out onthe Square all the people began to run, falling flat on their faces,and the _izvoshtchiki,_ standing on the corners, galloped in everydirection. Inside all was uproar, soldiers running here and there,grabbing up guns, rifle-belts and shouting, "Here they come! Herethey come!" ... But in a few minutes it quieted down again. The_izvoshtchiki_ came back, the people lying down stood up. Throughthe Red Arch appeared the _yunkers,_ marching a little out of step,one of them supported by two comrades.It was getting late when we left the Palace. The sentries in theSquare had all disappeared. The great semi-circle of Governmentbuildings seemed deserted. We went into the Hotel France for dinner,and right in the middle of soup the waiter, very pale in the face,came up and insisted that we move to the main dining-room at theback of the house, because they were going to put out the lights inthe café. "There will be much shooting," he said.When we came out on the Morskaya again it was quite dark, except forone flickering street-light on the corner of the Nevsky. Under thisstood a big armored automobile, with racing engine and oil-smokepouring out of it. A small boy had climbed up the side of the thingand was looking down the barrel of a machine gun. Soldiers andsailors stood around, evidently waiting for something. We walkedback up to the Red Arch, where a knot of soldiers was gatheredstaring at the brightly-lighted Winter Palace and talking in loudtones."No, comrades," one was saying. "How can we shoot at them? TheWomen's Battalion is in there-they will say we have fired on Russianwomen."As we reached the Nevsky again another armoured car came around thecorner, and a man poked his head out of the turret-top."Come on!" he yelled. "Let's go on through and attack!"The driver of the other car came over, and shouted so as to be heardabove the roaring engine. "The Committee says to wait. They have gotartillery behind the wood-piles in there...."Here the street-cars had stopped running, few people passed, andthere were no lights; but a few blocks away we could see the trams,the crowds, the lighted shop-windows and the electric signs of themoving-picture shows-life going on as usual. We had tickets to theBallet at the Marinsky Theatre-all theatres were open-but it was tooexciting out of doors....In the darkness we stumbled over lumber-piles barricading the PoliceBridge, and before the Stroganov Palace made out some soldierswheeling into position a three-inch field-gun. Men in variousuniforms were coming and going in an aimless way, and doing a greatdeal of talking....Up the Nevsky the whole city seemed to be out promenading. On everycorner immense crowds were massed around a core of hot discussion.Pickets of a dozen soldiers with fixed bayonets lounged at thestreet-crossings, red-faced old men in rich fur coats shook theirfists at them, smartly-dressed women screamed epithets; the soldiersargued feebly, with embarrassed grins.... Armoured cars went up anddown the street, named after the first Tsars-Oleg, Rurik,Svietoslav-and daubed with huge red letters, "R. S. D. R. P."_(Rossiskaya Partia_) [*]. At the Mikhailovsky a man appeared with an[* (Russian Social Democratic Labor Party).]armful of newspapers, and was immediately stormed by frantic people,offering a rouble, five roubles, ten roubles, tearing at each otherlike animals. It was _Rabotchi i Soldat,_ announcing the victory ofthe Proletarian Revolution, the liberation of the Bolsheviki stillin prison, calling upon the Army front and rear for support... afeverish little sheet of four pages, running to enormous type,containing no news....On the corner of the Sadovaya about two thousand citizens hadgathered, staring up at the roof of a tall building, where a tinyred spark glowed and waned."See!" said a tall peasant, pointing to it. "It is a provocator.Presently he will fire on the people...." Apparently no one thought ofgoing to investigate.The massive facade of Smolny blazed with lights as we drove up, andfrom every street converged upon it streams of hurrying shapes dimin the gloom. Automobiles and motorcycles came and went; an enormouselephant-coloured armoured automobile, with two red flags flyingfrom the turret, lumbered out with screaming siren. It was cold, andat the outer gate the Red Guards had built themselves a bon-fire. Atthe inner gate, too, there was a blaze, by the light of which thesentries slowly spelled out our passes and looked us up and down.The canvas covers had been taken off the four rapid-fire guns oneach side of the doorway, and the ammunition-belts hung snakelikefrom their breeches. A dun herd of armoured cars stood under thetrees in the court-yard, engines going. The long, bare,dimly-illuminated halls roared with the thunder of feet, calling,shouting.... There was an atmosphere of recklessness. A crowd camepouring down the staircase, workers in black blouses and round blackfur hats, many of them with guns slung over their shoulders,soldiers in rough dirt-coloured coats and grey fur _shapki_ pinchedflat, a leader or so-Lunatcharsky, Kameniev-hurrying along in thecentre of a group all talking at once, with harassed anxious faces,and bulging portfolios under their arms. The extraordinary meetingof the Petrograd Soviet was over. I stopped Kameniev-a quick movinglittle man, with a wide, vivacious face set close to his shoulders.Without preface he read in rapid French a copy of the resolutionjust passed:The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, salutingthe victorious Revolution of the Petrograd proletariat and garrison,particularly emphasises the unity, organisation, discipline, andcomplete cooperation shown by the masses in this rising; rarely hasless blood been spilled, and rarely has an insurrection succeeded sowell.The Soviet expresses its firm conviction that the Workers' andPeasants' Government which, as the government of the Soviets, willbe created by the Revolution, and which will assure the industrialproletariat of the support of the entire mass of poor peasants, willmarch firmly toward Socialism, the only means by which the countrycan be spared the miseries and unheard-of horrors of war.The new Workers' and Peasants' Government will propose immediately ajust and democratic peace to all the belligerent countries.It will suppress immediately the great landed property, and transferthe land to the peasants. It will establish workmen's control overproduction and distribution of manufactured products, and will setup a general control over the banks, which it will transform into astate monopoly.The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies calls uponthe workers and the peasants of Russia to support with all theirenergy and all their devotion the Proletarian Revolution. The Sovietexpresses its conviction that the city workers, allies of the poorpeasants, will assure complete revolutionary order, indispensable tothe victory of Socialism. The Soviet is convinced that theproletariat of the countries of Western Europe will aid us inconducting the cause of Socialism to a real and lasting victory."You consider it won then?"He lifted his shoulders. "There is much to do. Horribly much. It isjust beginning....On the landing I met Riazanov, vice-president of the Trade Unions,looking black and biting his grey beard. "It's insane! Insane!" heshouted. "The European working-class won't move! All Russia-" Hewaved his hand distractedly and ran off. Riazanov and Kameniev hadboth opposed the insurrection, and felt the lash of Lenin's terribletongue....It had been a momentous session. In the name of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee Trotzky had declared that the ProvisionalGovernment no longer existed."The characteristic of bourgeois governments," he said, "is todeceive the people. We, the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' andPeasants' Deputies, are going to try an experiment unique inhistory; we are going to found a power which will have no other aimbut to satisfy the needs of the soldiers, workers, and peasants."Lenin had appeared, welcomed with a mighty ovation, prophesyingworld-wide Social Revolution.... And Zinoviev, crying, "This day wehave paid our debt to the international proletariat, and struck aterrible blow at the war, a terrible body-blow at all theimperialists and particularly at Wilhelm the Executioner....Then Trotzky, that telegrams had been sent to the front announcingthe victorious insurrection, but no reply had come. Troops were saidto be marching against Petrograd-a delegation must be sent to tellthem the truth.Cries, "You are anticipating the will of the All-Russian Congress ofSoviets!"Trotzky, coldly, "The will of the All-Russian Congress of Sovietshas been anticipated by the rising of the Petrograd workers andsoldiers!"So we came into the great meeting-hall, pushing through theclamorous mob at the door. In the rows of seats, under the whitechandeliers, packed immovably in the aisles and on the sides,perched on every window-sill, and even the edge of the platform, therepresentatives of the workers and soldiers of all Russia waited inanxious silence or wild exultation the ringing of the chairman'sbell. There was no heat in the hall but the stifling heat ofunwashed human bodies. A foul blue cloud of cigarette smoke rosefrom the mass and hung in the thick air. Occasionally some one inauthority mounted the tribune and asked the comrades not to smoke;then everybody, smokers and all, took up the cry "Don't smoke,comrades!" and went on smoking. Petrovsky, Anarchist delegate fromthe Obukhov factory, made a seat for me beside him. Unshaven andfilthy, he was reeling from three nights' sleepless work on theMilitary Revolutionary Committee.On the platform sat the leaders of the old _Tsay-ee-kah_-for thelast time dominating the turbulent Soviets, which they had ruledfrom the first days, and which were now risen against them. It wasthe end of the first period of the Russian revolution, which thesemen had attempted to guide in careful ways.... The three greatest ofthem were not there: Kerensky, flying to the front through countrytowns all doubtfully heaving up; Tcheidze, the old eagle, who hadcontemptuously retired to his own Georgian mountains, there tosicken with consumption; and the high-souled Tseretelli, alsomortally stricken, who, nevertheless, would return and pour out hisbeautiful eloquence for a lost cause. Gotz sat there, Dan, Lieber,Bogdanov, Broido, Fillipovsky,-white-faced, hollow-eyed andindignant. Below them the second _siezd_ of the All-Russian Sovietsboiled and swirled, and over their heads the Military RevolutionaryCommittee functioned white-hot, holding in its hands the threads ofinsurrection and striking with a long arm.... It was 10.40 P. M.Dan, a mild-faced, baldish figure in a shapeless military surgeon'suniform, was ringing the bell. Silence fell sharply, intense, brokenby the scuffling and disputing of the people at the door...."We have the power in our hands," he began sadly, stopped for amoment, and then went on in a low voice. "Comrades! The Congress ofSoviets in meeting in such unusual circumstances and in such anextraordinary moment that you will understand why the _Tsay-ee-kah_considers it unnecessary to address you with a political speech.This will become much clearer to you if you will recollect that I ama member of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and that at this very moment ourparty comrades are in the Winter Palace under bombardment,sacrificing themselves to execute the duty put on them by the_Tsay-ee-kah."_ (Confused uproar.)"I declare the first session of the Second Congress of Soviets ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies open!"The election of the presidium took place amid stir and moving about.Avanessov announced that by agreement of the Bolsheviki, LeftSocialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki Internationalists, it wasdecided to base the presidium upon proportionality. SeveralMensheviki leaped to their feet protesting. A bearded soldiershouted at them, "Remember what you did to us Bolsheviki when _we_were the minority!" Result-14 Bolsheviki, 7 SocialistRevolutionaries, 3 Mensheviki and 1 Internationalist (Gorky'sgroup). Hendelmann, for the right and centre SocialistRevolutionaries, said that they refused to take part in thepresidium; the same from Kintchuk, for the Mensheviki; and from theMensheviki Internationalists, that until the verification of certaincircumstances, they too could not enter the presidium. Scatteringapplause and hoots. One voice, "Renegades, you call yourselvesSocialists!" A representative of the Ukrainean delegates demanded,and received, a place. Then the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ stepped down, andin their places appeared Trotzky, Kameniev, Lunatcharsky, MadameKollentai, Nogin.... The hall rose, thundering. How far they hadsoared, these Bolsheviki, from a despised and hunted sect less thanfour months ago, to this supreme place, the helm of great Russia infull tide of insurrection!The order of the day, said Kameniev, was first, Organisation ofPower; second, War and Peace; and third, the Constituent Assembly.Lozovsky, rising, announced that upon agreement of the bureau of allfactions, it was proposed to hear and discuss the report of thePetrograd Soviet, then to give the floor to members of the_Tsay-ee-kah_ and the different parties, and finally to pass to theorder of the day.But suddenly a new sound made itself heard, deeper than the tumultof the crowd, persistent, disquieting,-the dull shock of guns.People looked anxiously toward the clouded windows, and a sort offever came over them. Martov, demanding the floor, croaked hoarsely,"The civil war is beginning, comrades! The first question must be apeaceful settlement of the crisis. On principle and from a politicalstandpoint we must urgently discuss a means of averting civil war.Our brothers are being shot down in the streets! At this moment,when before the opening of the Congress of Soviets the question ofPower is being settled by means of a military plot organised by oneof the revolutionary parties-" for a moment he could not makehimself heard above the noise, "All of the revolutionary partiesmust face the fact! The first _vopros_ (question) before theCongress is the question of Power, and this question is alreadybeing settled by force of arms in the streets!... We must create apower which will be recognised by the whole democracy. If theCongress wishes to be the voice of the revolutionary democracy itmust not sit with folded hands before the developing civil war, theresult of which may be a dangerous outburst of counter-revolution....The possibility of a peaceful outcome lies in the formation of aunited democratic authority.... We must elect a delegation tonegotiate with the other Socialist parties and organisation....Always the methodical muffled boom of cannon through the windows,and the delegates, screaming at each other.... So, with the crash ofartillery, in the dark, with hatred, and fear, and reckless daring,new Russia was being born.The Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the United Social Democratssupported Martov's proposition. It was accepted. A soldier announcedthat the All-Russian Peasants' Soviets had refused to send delegatesto the Congress; he proposed that a committee be sent with a formalinvitation. "Some delegates are present," he said. "I move that theybe given votes." Accepted.Kharash, wearing the epaulets of a captain, passionately demandedthe floor. "The political hypocrites who control this Congress," heshouted, "told us we were to settle the question of Power-and it isbeing settled behind our backs, before the Congress opens! Blows arebeing struck against the Winter Palace, and it is by such blows thatthe nails are being driven into the coffin of the political partywhich has risked such an adventure!" Uproar. Followed him Gharra:"While we are here discussing propositions of peace, there is abattle on in the streets.... The Socialist Revolutionaries and theMensheviki refuse to be involved in what is happening, and call uponall public forces to resist the attempt to capture the power...."Kutchin, delegate of the 12th Army and representative of theTroudoviki: "I was sent here only for information, and I amreturning at once to the Front, where all the Army Committeesconsider that the taking of power by the Soviets, only three weeksbefore the Constituent Assembly, is a stab in the back of the Armyand a crime against the people-!" Shouts of "Lie! You lie!"... When hecould be heard again, "Let's make an end of this adventure inPetrograd! I call upon all delegates to leave this hall in order tosave the country and the Revolution!" As he went down the aisle inthe midst of a deafening noise, people surged in upon him,threatening.... Then Khintchuk, an officer with a long brown goatee,speaking suavely and persuasively: "I speak for the delegates fromthe Front. The Army is imperfectly represented in this Congress, andfurthermore, the Army does not consider the Congress of Sovietsnecessary at this time, only three weeks before the opening of theConstituent-" shouts and stamping, always growing more violent. "TheArmy does not consider that the Congress of Soviets has thenecessary authority-" Soldiers began to stand up all over the hall."Who are you speaking for? What do you represent?" they cried."The Central Executive Committee of the Soviet of the Fifth Army,the Second F- regiment, the First N- Regiment, the Third S- Rifles....""When were you elected? You represent the officers, not thesoldiers! What do the soldiers say about it?" Jeers and hoots."We, the Front group, disclaim all responsibility for what hashappened and is happening, and we consider it necessary to mobiliseall self-conscious revolutionary forces for the salvation of theRevolution! The Front group will leave the Congress.... The place tofight is out on the streets!"Immense bawling outcry. "You speak for the Staff-not for the Army!""I appeal to all reasonable soldiers to leave this Congress!""Kornilovitz! Counter-revolutionist! Provocator!" were hurled at him.On behalf of the Mensheviki, Khintchuk then announced that the onlypossibility of a peaceful solution was to begin negotiations withthe Provisional Government for the formation of a new Cabinet, whichwould find support in all strata of society. He could not proceedfor several minutes. Raising his voice to a shout he read theMenshevik declaration:"Because the Bolsheviki have made a military conspiracy with the aidof the Petrograd Soviet, without consulting the other factions andparties, we find it impossible to remain in the Congress, andtherefore withdraw, inviting the other groups to follow us and tomeet for discussion of the situation!""Deserter!" At intervals in the almost continuous disturbanceHendelman, for the Socialist Revolutionaries, could be heardprotesting against the bombardment of the Winter Palace.... "We areopposed to this kind of anarchy...."Scarcely had he stepped down than a young, lean-faced soldier, withflashing eyes, leaped to the platform, and dramatically lifted hishand:"Comrades!" he cried and there was a hush. "My _familia_ (name) isPeterson-I speak for the Second Lettish Rifles. You have heard thestatements of two representatives of the Army committees; thesestatements would have some value _if their authors had beenrepresentatives of the Army_-" Wild applause. _"But they do notrepresent the soldiers!"_ Shaking his fist. "The Twelfth Army hasbeen insisting for a long time upon the re-election of the GreatSoviet and the Army Committee, but just as your own _Tsay-ee-kah,_our Committee refused to call a meeting of the representatives ofthe masses until the end of September, so that the reactionariescould elect their own false delegates to this Congress. I tell younow, the Lettish soldiers have many times said, 'No moreresolutions! No more talk! We want deeds-the Power must be in ourhands!' Let these impostor delegates leave the Congress! The Army isnot with them!"The hall rocked with cheering. In the first moments of the session,stunned by the rapidity of events, startled by the sound of cannon,the delegates had hesitated. For an hour hammer-blow afterhammer-blow had fallen from that tribune, welding them together butbeating them down. Did they stand then alone? Was Russia risingagainst them? Was it true that the Army was marching on Petrograd?Then this clear-eyed young soldier had spoken, and in a flash theyknew it for the truth.... _This_ was the voice of the soldiers-thestirring millions of uniformed workers and peasants were men likethem, and their thoughts and feelings were the same...More soldiers ... Gzhelshakh; for the Front delegates, announcing thatthey had only decided to leave the Congress by a small majority, andthat _the Bolshevik members had not even taken part in the vote,_ asthey stood for division according to political parties, and notgroups. "Hundreds of delegates from the Front," he said, "are beingelected without the participation of the soldiers because the ArmyCommittees are no longer the real representatives of the rank andfile...." Lukianov, crying that officers like Kharash and Khintchukcould not represent the Army in this congress,-but only the highcommand. "The real inhabitants of the trenches want with all theirhearts the transfer of Power into the hands of the Soviets, and theyexpect very much from it!"... The tide was turning.Then came Abramovitch, for the _Bund,_ the organ of the JewishSocial Democrats-his eyes snapping behind thick glasses, tremblingwith rage."What is taking place now in Petrograd is a monstrous calamity! The_Bund_ group joins with the declaration of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries and will leave the Congress!" He raisedhis voice and hand. "Our duty to the Russian proletariat doesn'tpermit us to remain here and be responsible for these crimes.Because the firing on the Winter Palace doesn't cease, the MunicipalDuma together with the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, andthe Executive Committee of the Peasants' Soviet, has decided toperish with the Provisional Government, and we are going with them!Unarmed we will expose our breasts to the machine guns of theTerrorists.... We invite all delegates to this Congress-" The rest waslost in a storm of hoots, menaces and curses which rose to a hellishpitch as fifty delegates got up and pushed their way out....Kameniev jangled the bell, shouting, "Keep your seats and we'll goon with our business!" And Trotzky, standing up with a pale, cruelface, letting out his rich voice in cool contempt, "All theseso-called Socialist compromisers, these frightened Mensheviki,Socialist Revolutionaries, _Bund_-let them go! They are just so muchrefuse which will be swept into the garbage-heap of history!"Riazanov, for the Bolsheviki, stated that at the request of the CityDuma the Military Revolutionary Committee had sent a delegation tooffer negotiations to the Winter Palace. "In this way we have doneeverything possible to avoid blood-shed...."We hurried from the place, stopping for a moment at the room wherethe Military Revolutionary Committee worked at furious speed,engulfing and spitting out panting couriers, despatching Commissarsarmed with power of life and death to all the corners of the city,amid the buzz of the telephonographs. The door opened, a blast ofstale air and cigarette smoke rushed out, we caught a glimpse ofdishevelled men bending over a map under the glare of a shadedelectric-light.... Comrade Josephov-Dukhvinski, a smiling youth with amop of pale yellow hair, made out passes for us.When we came into the chill night, all the front of Smolny was onehuge park of arriving and departing automobiles, above the sound ofwhich could be heard the far-off slow beat of the cannon. A greatmotor-truck stood there, shaking to the roar of its engine. Men weretossing bundles into it, and others receiving them, with guns besidethem."Where are you going?" I shouted."Down-town-all over-everywhere!" answered a little workman,grinning, with a large exultant gesture.We showed our passes. "Come along!" they invited. "But there'llprobably be shooting-" We climbed in; the clutch slid home with araking jar, the great car jerked forward, we all toppled backward ontop of those who were climbing in; past the huge fire by the gate,and then the fire by the outer gate, glowing red on the faces of theworkmen with rifles who squatted around it, and went bumping at topspeed down the Suvorovsky Prospect, swaying from side to side.... Oneman tore the wrapping from a bundle and began to hurl handfuls of     l handfuls of     |          |papers into the air. We imitated him, plunging down through the darkstreet with a tail of white papers floating and eddying out behind.The late passerby stooped to pick them up; the patrols aroundbonfires on the corners ran out with uplifted arms to catch them.Sometimes armed men loomed up ahead, crying "_Shtoi!_" and raisingtheir guns, but our chauffeur only yelled something unintelligibleand we hurtled on....I picked up a copy of the paper, and under a fleeting street-lightread:TO THE CITIZENS OF RUSSIA!The Provisional Government is deposed. The State Power has passedinto the hands of the organ of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' andSoldiers' Deputies, the Military Revolutionary Committee, whichstands at the head of the Petrograd proletariat and garrison.The cause for which the people were fighting: immediate proposal ofa democratic peace, abolition of landlord property-rights over theland, labor control over production, creation of a SovietGovernment-that cause is securely achieved.LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION OF WORKMEN, SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS!_Military Revolutionary Committee__Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies._[Graphic page-96 Proclamation in Russian, title follows]                                              | _   111_ |Proclamation of the Fall of the Provisional Government issued by theMilitary Revolutionary Committee on the night of November 7th (ourcalendar), which we helped to distribute from a motor-truck justafter the surrender of the Winter Palace.A slant-eyed, Mongolian-faced man who sat beside me, dressed in agoat-skin Caucasian cape, snapped, "Look out! Here the provocatorsalways shoot from the windows!" We turned into Znamensky Square,dark and almost deserted, careened around Trubetskoy's brutal statueand swung down the wide Nevsky, three men standing up with riflesready, peering at the windows. Behind us the street was alive withpeople running and stooping. We could no longer hear the cannon, andthe nearer we drew to the Winter Palace end of the city the quieterand more deserted were the streets. The City Duma was all brightlylighted. Beyond that we made out a dark mass of people, and a lineof sailors, who yelled furiously at us to stop. The machine sloweddown, and we climbed out.It was an astonishing scene. Just at the corner of the EkaterinaCanal, under an arc-light, a cordon of armed sailors was drawnacross the Nevsky, blocking the way to a crowd of people in columnof fours. There were about three or four hundred of them, men infrock coats, well-dressed women, officers-all sorts and conditionsof people. Among them we recognised many of the delegates from theCongress, leaders of the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries;Avksentiev, the lean, red-bearded president of the Peasants'Soviets, Sarokin, Kerensky's spokesman, Khintchuk, Abramovitch; andat the head white-bearded old Schreider, Mayor of Petrograd, andProkopovitch, Minister of Supplies in the Provisional Government,arrested that morning and released. I caught sight of Malkin,reporter for the _Russian Daily News._ "Going to die in the WinterPalace," he shouted cheerfully. The procession stood still, but fromthe front of it came loud argument. Schreider and Prokopovitch werebellowing at the big sailor who seemed in command."We demand to pass!" they cried. "See, these comrades come from theCongress of Soviets! Look at their tickets! We are going to theWinter Palace!"The sailor was plainly puzzled. He scratched his head with anenormous hand, frowning. "I have orders from the Committee not tolet anybody go to the Winter Palace," he grumbled. "But I will senda comrade to telephone to Smolny....""We Insist upon passing! We are unarmed! We will march on whetheryou permit us or not!" cried old Schreider, very much excited."I have orders-" repeated the sailor sullenly."Shoot us if you want to! We will pass! Forward!" came from allsides. "We are ready to die, if you have the heart to fire onRussians and comrades! We bare our breasts to your guns!""No," said the sailor, looking stubborn, "I can't allow you to pass.""What will you do if we go forward? Will you shoot?""No, I'm not going to shoot people who haven't any guns. We won'tshoot unarmed Russian people....""We will go forward! What can you do?""We will do something,"replied the sailor, evidently at a loss. "Wecan't let you pass. We will do something.""What will you do? What will you do?"Another sailor came up, very much irritated. "We will spank you!" hecried, energetically. "And if necessary we will shoot you too. Gohome now, and leave us in peace!"At this there was a great clamour of anger and resentment,Prokopovitch had mounted some sort of box, and, waving his umbrella,he made a speech:"Comrades and citizens!" he said. "Force is being used against us!We cannot have our innocent blood upon the hands of these ignorantmen! It is beneath our dignity to be shot down here in the street byswitchmen-" (What he meant by "switchmen" I never discovered.) "Letus return to the Duma and discuss the best means of saving thecountry and the Revolution!"Whereupon, in dignified silence, the procession marched around andback up the Nevsky, always in column of fours. And taking advantageof the diversion we slipped past the guards and set off in thedirection of the Winter Palace.Here it was absolutely dark, and nothing moved but pickets ofsoldiers and Red Guards grimly intent. In front of the KazanCathedral a three-inch field-gun lay in the middle of the street,slewed sideways from the recoil of its last shot over the roofs.Soldiers were standing in every doorway talking in low tones andpeering down toward the Police Bridge. I heard one voice saying: "Itis possible that we have done wrong...." At the corners patrolsstopped all passersby-and the composition of these patrols wasinteresting, for in command of the regular troops was invariably aRed Guard.... The shooting had ceased.Just as we came to the Morskaya somebody was shouting: "The_yunkers_ have sent word they want us to go and get them out!"Voices began to give commands, and in the thick gloom we made out adark mass moving forward, silent but for the shuffle of feet and theclinking of arms. We fell in with the first ranks.Like a black river, filling all the street, without song or cheer wepoured through the Red Arch, where the man just ahead of me said ina low voice: "Look out, comrades! Don't trust them. They will fire,surely!" In the open we began to run, stooping low and bunchingtogether, and jammed up suddenly behind the pedestal of theAlexander Column."How many of you did they kill?" I asked."I don't know. About ten...."After a few minutes huddling there, some hundreds of men, the armyseemed reassured and without any orders suddenly began again to flowforward. By this time, in the light that streamed out of all theWinter Palace windows, I could see that the first two or threehundred men were Red Guards, with only a few scattered soldiers.Over the barricade of firewood we clambered, and leaping down insidegave a triumphant shout as we stumbled on a heap of rifles throwndown by the _yunkers_ who had stood there. On both sides of the maingateway the doors stood wide open, light streamed out, and from thehuge pile came not the slightest sound.Carried along by the eager wave of men we were swept into the righthand entrance, opening into a great bare vaulted room, the cellar ofthe East wing, from which issued a maze of corridors andstair-cases. A number of huge packing cases stood about, and uponthese the Red Guards and soldiers fell furiously, battering themopen with the butts of their rifles, and pulling out carpets,curtains, linen, porcelain plates, glassware.... One man wentstrutting around with a bronze clock perched on his shoulder;another found a plume of ostrich feathers, which he stuck in hishat. The looting was just beginning when somebody cried, "Comrades!Don't touch anything! Don't take anything! This is the property ofthe People!" Immediately twenty voices were crying, "Stop! Puteverything back! Don't take anything! Property of the People!" Manyhands dragged the spoilers down. Damask and tapestry were snatchedfrom the arms of those who had them; two men took away the bronzeclock. Roughly and hastily the things were crammed back in theircases, and self-appointed sentinels stood guard. It was all utterlyspontaneous. Through corridors and up stair-cases the cry could beheard growing fainter and fainter in the distance, "Revolutionarydiscipline! Property of the People...."We crossed back over to the left entrance, in the West wing. Thereorder was also being established. "Clear the Palace!" bawled a RedGuard, sticking his head through an inner door. "Come, comrades,let's show that we're not thieves and bandits. Everybody out of thePalace except the Commissars, until we get sentries posted."Two Red Guards, a soldier and an officer, stood with revolvers intheir hands. Another soldier sat at a table behind them, with penand paper. Shouts of "All out! All out!" were heard far and nearwithin, and the Army began to pour  through the door, jostling,expostulating, arguing. As each man appeared he was seized by theself-appointed committee, who went through his pockets and lookedunder his coat. Everything that was plainly not his property wastaken away, the man at the table noted it on his paper, and it wascarried into a little room. The most amazing assortment of objectswere thus confiscated; statuettes, bottles of ink, bed-spreadsworked with the Imperial monogram, candles, a small oil-painting,desk blotters, gold-handled swords, cakes of soap, clothes of everydescription, blankets. One Red Guard carried three rifles, two ofwhich he had taken away from _yunkers;_ another had four portfoliosbulging with written documents. The culprits either sullenlysurrendered or pleaded like children. All talking at once thecommittee explained that stealing was not worthy of the people'schampions; often those who had been caught turned around and beganto help go through the rest of the comrades. (See App. IV, Sect. 3)_Yunkers_ came out, in bunches of three or four. The committeeseized upon them with an excess of zeal, accompanying the searchwith remarks like, "Ah, Provocators! Kornilovists!Counter-revolutionists! Murderers of the People!" But there was noviolence done, although the _yunkers_ were terrified. They too hadtheir pockets full of small plunder. It was carefully noted down bythe scribe, and piled in the little room.... The _yunkers_ weredisarmed. "Now, will you take up arms against the People any more?"demanded clamouring voices."No," answered the _yunkers,_ one by one. Whereupon they wereallowed to go free.We asked if we might go inside. The committee was doubtful, but thebig Red Guard answered firmly that it was forbidden. "Who are youanyway?" he asked. "How do I know that you are not all Kerenskys?(There were five of us, two women.)"_Pazhal'st', touarishtchi!_ Way, Comrades!" A soldier and a RedGuard appeared in the door, waving the crowd aside, and other guardswith fixed bayonets. After them followed single file half a dozenmen in civilian dress-the members of the Provisional Government.First came Kishkin, his face drawn and pale, then Rutenberg, lookingsullenly at the floor; Terestchenko was next, glancing sharplyaround; he stared at us with cold fixity.... They passed in silence;the victorious insurrectionists crowded to see, but there were onlya few angry mutterings. It was only later that we learned how thepeople in the street wanted to lynch them, and shots were fired-butthe sailors brought them safely to Peter-Paul....In the meanwhile unrebuked we walked into the Palace. There wasstill a great deal of coming and going, of exploring new-foundapartments in the vast edifice, of searching for hidden garrisons of_yunkers_ which did not exist. We went upstairs and wandered throughroom after room. This part of the Palace had been entered also byother detachments from the side of the Neva. The paintings, statues,tapestries and rugs of the great state apartments were unharmed; inthe offices, however, every desk and cabinet had been ransacked, thepapers scattered over the floor, and in the living rooms beds hadbeen stripped of their coverings and ward-robes wrenched open. Themost highly prized loot was clothing, which the working peopleneeded. In a room where furniture was stored we came upon twosoldiers ripping the elaborate Spanish leather upholstery fromchairs. They explained it was to make boots with....The old Palace servants in their blue and red and gold uniformsstood nervously about, from force of habit repeating, "You can't goin there, _barin!_ It is forbidden-" We penetrated at length to thegold and malachite chamber with crimson brocade hangings where theMinisters had been in session all that day and night, and where the_shveitzari_ had betrayed them to the Red Guards. The long tablecovered with green baize was just as they had left it, under arrest.Before each empty seat was pen and ink and paper; the papers werescribbled over with beginnings of plans of action, rough drafts ofproclamations and manifestos. Most of these were scratched out, astheir futility became evident, and the rest of the sheet coveredwith absent-minded geometrical designs, as the writers satdespondently listening while Minister after Minister proposedchimerical schemes. I took one of these scribbled pages, in the handwriting of Konovalov, which read, "The Provisional Governmentappeals to all classes to support the Provisional Government-"All this time, it must be remembered, although the Winter Palace wassurrounded, the Government was in constant communication with theFront and with provincial Russia. The Bolsheviki had captured theMinistry of War early in the morning, but they did not know of themilitary telegraph office in the attic, nor of the private telephoneline connecting it with the Winter Palace. In that attic a youngofficer sat all day, pouring out over the country a flood of appealsand proclamations; and when he heard that the Palace had fallen, puton his hat and walked calmly out of the building....Interested as we were, for a considerable time we didn't notice achange in the attitude of the soldiers and Red Guards around us. Aswe strolled from room to room a small group followed us, until bythe time we reached the great picture-gallery where we had spent theafternoon with the _yunkers,_ about a hundred men surged in afterus. One giant of a soldier stood in our path, his face dark withsullen suspicion.[Graphic page-104  Doodling by Konavalov, title follows]Facsimile of the beginning of a proclamation, written in pencil byA.I. Konovalov, Minister of Commerce and Industry in he ProvisionalGovernment, and then scratched out as the hopelessness of thesituation became more and more evident. The geometrical figurebeneath was probably idly drawn while the Ministers were waiting forthe end."Who are you?" he growled. "What are you doing here?" The othersmassed slowly around, staring and beginning to mutter._"Provocatori!"_ I heard somebody say. "Looters!" I produced ourpasses from the Military Revolutionary Committee. The soldier tookthem gingerly, turned them upside down and looked at them withoutcomprehension. Evidently he could not read. He handed them back andspat on the floor. _"Bumagi!_ Papers!" said he with contempt. Themass slowly began to close in, like wild cattle around a cowpuncheron foot. Over their heads I caught sight of an officer, lookinghelpless, and shouted to him. He made for us, shouldering his waythrough."I'm the Commissar," he said to me. "Who are you? What is it?" Theothers held back, waiting. I produced the papers."You are foreigners?" he rapidly asked in Franch. "It is verydangerous...." Then he turned to the mob, holding up our documents."Comrades!" he cried. "These people are foreign comrades-fromAmerica. They have come here to be able to tell their countrymenabout the bravery and the revolutionary discipline of theproletarian army!""How do you know that?" replied the big soldier. "I tell you theyare provocators! They say they came here to observe therevolutionary discipline of the proletarian army, but they have beenwandering freely through the Palace, and how do we know they haven'tgot their pockets full of loot?"_"Pravilno!"_ snarled the others, pressing forward."Comrades! Comrades!" appealed the officer, sweat standing out onhis forehead. "I am Commissar of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. Do you trust me? Well, I tell you that these passes aresigned with the same names that are signed to my pass!"He led us down through the Palace and out through a door openingonto the Neva quay, before which stood the usual committee goingthrough pockets... "You have narrowly escaped," he kept muttering,wiping his face."What happened to the Women's Battalion?" we asked."Oh-the women!" He laughed. "They were all huddled up in a backroom. We had a terrible time deciding what to do with them-many werein hysterics, and so on. So finally we marched them up to theFinland Station and put them on a train for Levashovo, where theyhave a camp. (See App. IV, Sect. 4)....We came out into the cold, nervous night, murmurous with obscurearmies on the move, electric with patrols. From across the river,where loomed the darker mass of Peter-Paul, came a hoarse shout....Underfoot the sidewalk was littered with broken stucco, from thecornice of the Palace where two shells from the battleship _Avrora_had struck; that was the only damage done by the bombardment....It was now after three in the morning. On the Nevsky all thestreet-lights were again shining, the cannon gone, and the onlysigns of war were Red Guards and soldiers squatting around fires.The city was quiet-probably never so quiet in its history; on thatnight not a single hold-up occurred, not a single robbery.But the City Duma Building was all illuminated. We mounted to thegalleried Alexander Hall, hung with its great, gold-framed,red-shrouded Imperial portraits. About a hundred people were groupedaround the platform, where Skobeliev was speaking. He urged that theCommittee of Public Safety be expanded, so as to unite all theanti-Bolshevik elements in one huge organisation, to be called theCommittee for Salvation of Country and Revolution. And as we lookedon, the Committee for Salvation was formed-that Committee which wasto develop into the most powerful enemy of the Bolsheviki,appearing, in the next week, sometimes under its own partisan name,and sometimes as the strictly non-partisan Committee of PublicSafety....Dan, Gotz, Avkesntiev were there, some of the insurgent Sovietdelegates, members of the Executive Committee of the Peasants'Soviets, old Prokopovitch, and even members of the  Council of theRepublic-among whom Vinaver and other Cadets. Lieber cried that theconvention of Soviets was not a legal convention, that the old_Tsay-ee-kah_ was still in office.... An appeal to the country wasdrafted.We hailed a cab. "Where to?" But when we said "Smolny," the_izvoshtchik_ shook his head. _"Niet!"_ said he, "there aredevils...." It was only after weary wandering that we found a driverwilling to take us-and he wanted thirty rubles, and stopped twoblocks away.The windows of Smolny were still ablaze, motors came and went, andaround the still-leaping fires the sentries huddled close, eagerlyasking everybody the latest news. The corridors were full ofhurrying men, hollow-eyed and dirty. In some of the committee-roomspeople lay sleeping on the floor, their guns beside them. In spiteof the seceding delegates, the hall of meetings was crowded withpeople, roaring like the sea. As we came in, Kameniev was readingthe list of arrested Ministers. The name of Terestchenko was greetedwith thunderous applause, shouts of satisfaction, laughter;Rutenburg came in for less; and at the mention of Paltchinsky, astorm of hoots, angry cries, cheers burst forth.... It was announcedthat Tchudnovsky had been appointed Commissar of the Winter Palace.Now occurred a dramatic interruption. A big peasant, his beardedface convulsed with rage, mounted the platform and pounded with hisfist on the presidium table."We, Socialist Revolutionaries, insist upon the immediate release ofthe Socialist Ministers arrested in the Winter Palace! Comrades! Doyou know that four comrades who risked their lives and their freedomfighting against tyranny of the Tsar, have been flung intoPeter-Paul prison-the historical tomb of Liberty?" In the uproar hepounded and yelled. Another delegate climbed up beside him, andpointed at the presidium."Are the representatives of the revolutionary masses going to sitquietly here while the _Okhrana_ of the Bolsheviki tortures theirleaders?"Trotzky was gesturing for silence. "These 'comrades' who are nowcaught plotting the crushing of the Soviets with the adventurerKerensky-is there any reason to handle them with gloves? After July16th and 18th they didn't use much ceremony with us!" With atriumphant ring in his voice he cried, "Now that the _oborontsi_ andthe faint-hearted have gone, and the whole task of defending andsaving the Revolution rests on our shoulders, it is particularlynecessary to work-work-work! We have decided to die rather than giveup!"Followed him a Commissar from Tsarskoye Selo, panting and coveredwith the mud of his ride. "The garrison of Tsarskoye Selo is onguard at the gates of Petrograd, ready to defend the Soviets and theMilitary Revolutionary Committee!" Wild cheers. "The Cycle Corpssent from the front has arrived at Tsarskoye, and the soldiers arenow with us; they recognise the power of the Soviets, the necessityof immediate transfer of land to the peasants and industrial controlto the workers. The Fifth Battalion of Cyclists, stationed atTsarskoye, is ours....Then the delegate of the Third Cycle Battalion. In the midst ofdelirious enthusiasm he told how the cycle corps had been ordered_three days before_ from the South-west front to the "defence ofPetrograd." They suspected, however, the meaning of the order; andat the station of Peredolsk were met by representatives of the FifthBattalion from Tsarskoye. A joint meeting was held, and it wasdiscovered that "among the cyclists not a single man was foundwilling to shed the blood of his brothers, or to support aGovernment of bourgeois and land-owners!"Kapelinski, for the Mensheviki Internationalists, proposed to electa special committee to find a peaceful solution to the civil war."There isn't any peaceful solution!" bellowed the crowed. "Victoryis the only solution!" The vote was overwhelmingly against, and theMensheviki Internationalists left the Congress in a Whirlwind ofJocular insults. There was no longer any panic fear.... Kameniev fromthe platform shouted after them, "The Mensheviki Internationalistsclaimed 'emergency' for the question of a 'peaceful solution,' butthey always voted for suspension of the order of the day in favourof declarations of factions which wanted to leave the Congress. Itis evident," finished Kameniev, "that the withdrawal of all theserenegades was decided upon beforehand!"The assembly decided to ignore the withdrawal of the factions, andproceed to the appeal to the workers, soldiers and peasants of allRussia:TO WORKERS, SOLDIERS AND PEASANTSThe Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies has opened. It represents the great majority of theSoviets. There are also a number of Peasant deputies. Based upon thewill of the great majority of the workers', soldiers and peasants,based upon the triumphant uprising of the Petrograd workmen andsoldiers, the Congress assumes the Power.The Provisional Government is deposed. Most of the members of theProvisional Government are already arrested.The Soviet authority will at once propose an immediate democraticpeace to all nations, and an immediate truce on all fronts. It willassure the free transfer of landlord, crown and monastery lands tothe Land Committees, defend the soldiers rights, enforcing acomplete democratisation of the Army, establish workers' controlover production, ensure the convocation of the Constituent Assemblyat the proper date, take means to supply bread to the cities andarticles of first necessity to the villages, and secure to allnationalities living in Russia a real right to independent existence.The Congress resolves: that all local power shall be transferred tothe Soviets of Workers,' Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, whichmust enforce revolutionary order.The Congress calls upon the soldiers in the trenches to be watchfuland steadfast. The Congress of Soviets is sure that therevolutionary Army will know how to defend the Revolution againstall attacks of Imperialism, until the new Government shall havebrought about the conclusion of the democratic peace which it willdirectly propose to all nations. The new Government will take allnecessary steps to secure everything needful to the revolutionaryArmy, by means of a determined policy of requisition and taxation ofthe propertied classes, and also to improve the situation ofsoldiers' families.The Kornilovitz-Kerensky, Kaledin and others, are endeavouring tolead troops against Petrograd. Several regiments, deceived byKerensky, have sided with the insurgent People.Soldiers! Make active resistance to the Kornilovitz-Kerensky! Be onguard!Railway men! Stop all troop-trains being sent by Kerensky againstPetrograd!Soldiers, Workers, Clerical employees! The destiny of the Revolutionand democratic peace is in your hands!Long live the Revolution!_The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of__Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.__Delegates from the Peasants' Soviets._It was exactly 5:17 A.M. when Krylenko, staggering with fatigue,climbed to the tribune with a telegram in his hand."Comrades! From the Northern Front. The Twelfth Army sends greetingsto the Congress of Soviets, announcing the formation of a MilitaryRevolutionary Committee which has taken over the command of theNorthern Front!" Pandemonium, men weeping, embracing each other."General Tchermissov has recognised the Committee-Commissar of theProvisional Government Voitinsky has resigned!"So. Lenin and the Petrograd workers had decided on insurrection, thePetrograd Soviet had overthrown the Provisional Government, andthrust the _coup d'etat_ upon the Congress of Soviets. Now there wasall great Russia to win-and then the world! Would Russia follow andrise? And the world-what of it? Would the peoples answer and rise, ared world-tide?Although it was six in the morning, night was yet heavy and chill.There was only a faint unearthly pallor stealing over the silentstreets, dimming the watch-fires, the shadow of a terrible dawngrey-rising over Russia....                              Chapter V                            Plunging AheadTHURSDAY, November 8th. Day broke on a city in the wildestexcitement and confusion, a whole nation having up in long hissingswells of storm. Superficially all was quiet; hundreds of thousandsof people retired at a prudent hour, got up early, and went to work.In Petrograd the street-cars were running, the stores andrestaurants open, theatres going, an exhibition of paintingsadvertised.... All the complex routine of common life-humdrum even inwar-time-proceeded as usual. Nothing is so astounding as thevitality of the social organism-how it persists, feeding itself,clothing itself, amusing itself, in the face of the worstcalamities....The air was full of rumours about Kerensky, who was said to haveraised the Front, and to be leading a great army against thecapital. _Volia Naroda_ published a _prikaz_ launched by him atPskov:The disorders caused by the insane attempt of the Bolsheviki placethe country on the verge of a precipice, and demand the effort ofour entire will, our courage and the devotion of every one of us, towin through the terrible trial which the fatherland is undergoing....Until the declaration of the composition of the new Government-ifone is formed-every one ought to remain at his post and fulfil hisduty toward bleeding Russia. It must be remembered that the leastinterference with existing Army organisations can bring onirreparable misfortunes, by opening the Front to the enemy.Therefore it is indispensable to preserve at any price the morale ofthe troops, by assuring complete order and the preservation of theArmy from new shocks, and by maintaining absolute confidence betweenofficers and their subordinates. I order all the chiefs andCommissars, in the name of the safety of the country, to stay attheir posts, as I myself retain the post of Supreme Commander, untilthe Provisional Government of the Republic shall declare its will....In answer, this placard on all the walls:FROM THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS"The ex-Ministers Konovalov, Kishkin, Terestchenko, Maliantovitch,Nikitin and others have been arrested by the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. Kerensky has fled. All Army organisations are ordered totake every measure for the immediate arrest of Kerensky and hisconveyance to Petrograd."All assistance given to Kerensky will be punished as a seriouscrime against the state."With brakes released the Military Revolutionary Committee whirled,throwing off orders, appeals, decrees, like sparks. (See App. V,Sect. 1)... Kornilov was ordered brought to Petrograd. Members of thePeasant Land Committees imprisoned by the Provisional Governmentwere declared free. Capital punishment in the army was abolished.Government employees were ordered to continue their work, andthreatened with severe penalties if they refused. All pillage,disorder and speculation were forbidden under pain of death.Temporary Commissars were appointed to the various Ministries:Foreign Affairs, Vuritsky and Trotzky; Interior and Justice, Rykov;Labor, Shliapnikov; Finance, Menzhinsky; Public Welfare, MadameKollontai; Commerce, Ways and Communications, Riazanov; Navy, thesailor Korbir; Posts and Telegraphs, Spiro; Theatres, Muraviov;State Printing Office, Gherbychev; for the City of Petrograd,Lieutenant Nesterov; for the Northern Front, Pozern....To the Army, appeal to set up Military Revolutionary Committees. Tothe railway workers, to maintain order, especially not to delay thetransport of food to the cities and the front.... In return, they werepromised representation in the Ministry of Ways and Communications.Cossack brothers! (said one proclamation). You are being led againstPetrograd. They want to force you into battle with the revolutionaryworkers and soldiers of the capital. Do not believe a word that issaid by our common enemies, the land-owners and the capitalists.At our Congress are represented all the conscious organisations ofworkers, soldiers and peasants of Russia. The Congress wishes alsoto welcome into its midst the worker-Cossacks. The Generals of theBlack Band, henchmen of the land-owners, of Nicolai the Cruel, areour enemies.They tell you that the Soviets wish to confiscate the lands of theCossacks. This is a lie. It is only from the great Cossack landlordsthat the Revolution will confiscate the land to give it to thepeople.Organise Soviets of Cossacks' Deputies! Join with the Soviets ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies!Show the Black Band that you are not traitors to the People, andthat you do not wish to be cursed by the whole of revolutionaryRussia!...Cossack brothers, execute no orders of the enemies of the people.Send your delegates to Petrograd to talk it over with us.... TheCossacks of the Petrograd garrison, to their honour, have notjustified the hope of the People's enemies....Cossack brothers! The All-Russian Congress of Soviets extends to youa fraternal hand. Long live the brotherhood of the Cossacks with thesoldiers, workers and peasants of all Russia!On the other side, what a storm of proclamations posted up,hand-bills scattered everywhere, newspapers-screaming and cursingand prophesying evil. Now raged the battle of the printing press-allother weapons being in the hands of the Soviets.First, the appeal of the Committee for Salvation of Country andRevolution, flung broadcast over Russia and Europe:TO THE CITIZENS OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC!Contrary to the will of the revolutionary masses, on November 7ththe Bolsheviki of Petrograd criminally arrested part of theProvisional Government, dispersed the Council of the Republic, andproclaimed an illegal power. Such violence committed against theGovernment of revolutionary Russia at the moment of its greatestexternal danger, is an indescribable crime against the fatherland.The insurrection of the Bolsheviki deals a mortal blow to the causeof national defence, and postpones immeasurably the moment of peaceso greatly desired.Civil war, begun by the Bolsheviki, threatens to deliver the countryto the horrors of anarchy and counter-revolution, and cause thefailure of the Constituent Assembly, which must affirm therepublican régime and transmit to the People forever their right tothe land.Preserving the continuity of the only legal Governmental power, theCommittee for Salvation of Country and Revolution, established onthe night of November 7th, takes the initiative in forming a newProvisional Government; which, basing itself on the forces ofdemocracy, will conduct the country to the Constituent Assembly andsave it from anarchy and counter-revolution. The Committee forSalvation summons you, citizens, to refuse to recognise the power ofviolence. Do not obey its orders!Rise for the defence of the country and Revolution!Support the Committee for Salvation!Signed by the Council of the Russian Republic, the Municipal Duma ofPetrograd, the _Tsay-ee-kah (First Congress),_ the ExecutiveCommittee of the Peasants' Soviets, and from the Congress itself theFront group, the factions of Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviki,Populist Socialists, Unified Social Democrats, and the group"Yedinstvo."Then posters from the Socialist Revolutionary party, the Mensheviki_oborontsi,_ Peasants' Soviets again; from the Central ArmyCommittee, the _Tsentroflot_....... Famine will crush Petrograd! (they cried). The German armies willtrample on our liberty. Black Hundred _pogroms_ will spread overRussia, if we all-conscious workers, soldiers, citizens-do notunite....Do not trust the promises of the Bolsheviki! The promise ofimmediate peace-is a lie! The promise of bread-a hoax! The promiseof land-a fairy tale!...They were all in this manner.Comrades! You have been basely and cruelly deceived! The seizure ofpower has been accomplished by the Bolsheviki alone.... They concealedtheir plot from the other Socialist parties composing the Soviet....You have been promised land and freedom, but the counter-revolutionwill profit by the anarchy called forth by the Bolsheviki, and willdeprive you of land and freedom....The newspapers were as violent.Our duty (said the _Dielo Naroda_) is to unmask these traitors tothe working-class. Our duty is to mobilise all our forces and mountguard over the cause of the Revolution!..._Izviestia,_ for the last time speaking in the name of the old_Tsay-ee-kah,_ threatened awful retribution.As for the Congress of Soviets, we affirm that there has been noCongress of Soviets! We affirm that it was merely a privateconference of the Bolshevik faction! And in that case, they have noright to cancel the powers of the _Tsay-ee-kah_...._Novaya Zhizn,_ while pleading for a new Government that shouldunite all the Socialist parties, criticised severely the action ofthe Socialist Revolutionaries and the Mensheviki in quitting theCongress, and pointed out that the Bolshevik insurrection meant onething very clearly: that all illusions about coalition with thebourgeoisie were henceforth demonstrated vain..._Rabotchi Put_ blossomed out as _Pravda,_ Lenin's newspaper whichhad been suppressed in July. It crowed, bristling:Workers, soldiers, peasants! In March you struck down the tyranny ofthe clique of nobles. Yesterday you struck down the tyranny of thebourgeois gang....The first task now is to guard the approaches to Petrograd.The second is definitely to disarm the counter-revolutionaryelements of Petrograd.The third is definitely to organise the revolutionary power andassure the realisation of the popular programme...What few Cadet organs appeared, and the bourgeoisie generally,adopted a detached, ironical attitude toward the whole business, asort of contemptuous "I-told-you-so" to the other parties.Influential Cadets were to be seen hovering around the MunicipalDuma, and on the outskirts of the Committee for Salvation. Otherthan that, the bourgeoisie lay low, biding its hour-which could notfar off. That the Bolsheviki would remain in power longer than threedays never occurred to anybody-except perhaps to Lenin, Trotzky, thePetrograd workers and the simpler soldiers....In the high, amphitheatrical Nicolai Hall that afternoon I saw theDuma sitting in _permanence,_ tempestuous, grouping around it allthe forces of opposition. The old Mayer, Schreider, majestic withhis white hair and beard, was describing his visit to Smolny thenight before, to protest in the name of the MunicipalSelf-Government. "The Duma, being the only existing legal Governmentin the city, elected by equal, direct and secret suffrage, would notrecognise the new power," he had told Trotzky. And Trotzky hadanswered, "There is a constitutional remedy for that. The Duma canbe dissolved and re-elected...." At this report there was a furiousoutcry."If one recognises a Government by bayonet," continued the old man,addressing the Duma, "well, we have one; but I consider legitimateonly a Government recognised by the majority, and not one created bythe usurpation of a minority!" Wild applause on all benches exceptthose of the Bolsheviki. Amid renewed tumult the Mayor announcedthat the Bolsheviki already were violating Municipal autonomy byappointing Commissars in many departments.The Bolshevik speaker shouted, trying to make himself heard, thatthe decision of the Congress of Soviets meant that all Russia backedup the action of the Bolsheviki."You!" he cried. "You are not the real representative of the peopleof Petrograd!" Shrieks of "Insult! Insult!" The old Mayor, withdignity, reminded him that the Duma was elected by the freestpossible popular vote. "Yes," he answered, "but that was a long timeago-like the _Tsay-ee-kah_-like the Army Committee.""There has been no new Congress of Soviets!" they yelled at him."The Bolshevik faction refuses to remain any longer in this nest ofcounter-revolution-" Uproar. "-and we demand a re-election of theDuma...." Whereupon the Bolsheviki left the chamber, followed by criesof "German agents! Down with the traitors!"Shingariov, Cadet, then demanded that all Municipal functionarieswho had consented to be Commissars of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee be discharged from their position and indicted. Schreiderwas on his feet, putting a motion to the effect that the Dumaprotested against the menace of the Bolsheviki to dissolve it, andas the legal representative of the population, it would refuse toleave its post.Outside, the Alexander Hall was crowded for the meeting of theCommittee for Salvation, and Skobeliev was again speaking. "Neveryet," he said, "was the fate of the Revolution so acute, never yetdid the question of the existence of the Russian state excite somuch anxiety, never yet did history put so harshly and categoricallythe question-is Russia to be or not to be! The great hour for thesalvation of the Revolution has arrived, and in consciousnessthereof we observe the close union of the live forces of therevolutionary democracy, by whose organised will a centre for thesalvation of the country and the Revolution has already beencreated...." And much of the same sort. "We shall die sooner thansurrender our post!"Amid violent applause it was announced that the Union of RailwayWorkers had joined the Committee for Salvation. A few moments laterthe Post and Telegraph Employees came in; then some MenshevikiInternationalists entered the hall, to cheers. The Railway men saidthey did not recognise the Bolsheviki and had taken the entirerailroad apparatus into their own hands, refusing to entrust it toany usurpatory power. The Telegraphers' delegate declared that theoperators had flatly refused to work their instruments as long asthe Bolshevik Commissar was in the office. The Postmen would notdeliver or accept mail at Smolny.... All the Smolny telephones werecut off. With great glee it was reported how Uritzky had gone to theMinistry of Foreign Affairs to demand the secret treaties, and howNeratov had put him out. The Government employees were all stoppingwork....It was war-war deliberately planned, Russian fashion; war by strikeand sabotage. As we sat there the chairman read a list of names andassignments; so-and-so was to make the round of the Ministries;another was to visit the banks; some ten or twelve were to work thebarracks and persuade the soldiers to remain neutral-"Russiansoldiers, do not shed the blood of your brothers!"; a committee wasto go and confer with Kerensky; still others were despatched toprovincial cities, to form branches of the Committee for Salvation,and link together the anti-Bolshevik elements.The crowd was in high spirits. "These Bolsheviki _will_ try todictate to the _intelligentzia?_ We'll show them!"... Nothing could bemore striking than the contrast between this assemblage and theCongress of Soviets. There, great masses of shabby soldiers, grimyworkmen, peasants-poor men, bent and scarred in the brute strugglefor existence; here the Menshevik and Social Revolutionaryleaders-Avksentievs, Dans, Liebers,-the former SocialistMinisters-Skobelievs, Tchernovs,-rubbed shoulders with Cadets likeoily Shatsky, sleek Vinaver; with journalists, students,intellectuals of almost all camps. This Duma crowd was well-fed,well-dressed; I did not see more than three proletarians among themall....News came. Kornilov's faithful _Tekhintsi_  [*] had slaughtered his[* See Notes and Explanations]guards at Bykhov, and he had escaped. Kaledin was marching north....The Soviet of Moscow had set up a Military Revolutionary Committee,and was negotiating with the commandant of the city for possessionof the arsenal, so that the workers might be armed.With these facts was mixed an astounding jumble of rumours,distortions, and plain lies. For instance, an intelligent youngCadet, formerly private secretary to Miliukov and then toTerestchenko, drew us aside and told us all about the taking of theWinter Palace."The Bolsheviki were led by German and Austrian officers," heaffirmed."Is that so?" we replied, politely. "How do you know?""A friend of mine was there and saw them.""How could he tell they were German officers?""Oh, because they wore German uniforms!"There were hundreds of such absurd tales, and they were not onlysolemnly published by the anti-Bolshevik press, but believed by themost unlikely persons-Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki whohad always been distinguished by their sober devotion to facts....But more serious were the stories of Bolshevik violence andterrorism. For example, it was said printed that the Red Guards hadnot only thoroughly looted the Winter Palace, but that they hadmassacred the _yunkers_ after disarming them, had killed some of theMinisters in cold blood; and as for the woman soldiers, most of themhad been violated, and many had committed suicide because of thetortures they had gone through.... All these stories were swallowedwhole by the crowd in the Duma. And worse still, the mothers andfathers of the students and of the women read these frightfuldetails, _often accompanied by lists of names,_ and toward nightfallthe Duma began to be besieged by frantic citizens....A typical case is that of Prince Tumanov, whose body, it wasannounced in many newspapers, had been found floating in the MoikaCanal. A few hours later this was denied by the Prince's family, whoadded that the Prince was under arrest so the press identified thedead man as General Demissov. The General having also come to life,we investigated, and could find no trace of any body found whatever....As we left the Duma building two boy scouts were distributinghand-bills (See App. V, Sect. 2) to the enormous crowd which blockedthe Nevsky in front of the door-a crowd composed almost entirely ofbusiness men, shop-keepers, _tchinouniki,_ clerks. One read!FROM THE MUNICIPAL DUMAThe Municipal Duma in its meeting of October 26th, in view of theevents of the day decrees: To announce the inviolability of privatedwellings. Through the House Committees it calls upon the populationof the town of Petrograd to meet with decisive repulse all attemptsto enter by force private apartments, not stopping at the use ofarms, in the interests of the self-defence of citizens.Up on the corner of the Liteiny, five or six Red Guards and a coupleof sailors had surrounded a news-dealer and were demanding that hehand over his copies of the Menshevik _Rabot-chaya Gazeta_ (Workers'Gazette). Angrily he shouted at them, shaking his fist, as one ofthe sailors tore the papers from his stand. An ugly crowd hadgathered around, abusing the patrol. One little workman keptexplaining doggedly to the people and the news-dealer, over and overagain, "It has Kerensky's proclamation in it. It says we killedRussian people. It will make bloodshed...."Smolny was tenser than ever, if that were possible. The same runningmen in the dark corridors, squads of workers with rifles, leaderswith bulging portfolios arguing, explaining, giving orders as theyhurried anxiously along, surrounded by friends and lieutenants. Menliterally out of themselves, living prodigies of sleeplessness andwork-men unshaven, filthy, with burning eyes, who drove upon theirfixed purpose full speed on engines of exaltation. So much they hadto do, so much! Take over the Government, organise the City, keepthe garrison loyal, fight the Duma and the Committee for Salvation,keep out the Germans, prepare to do battle with Kerensky, inform theprovinces what had happened, Propagandise from Archangel toVladivostok.... Government and Municipal employees refusing to obeytheir Commissars, post and telegraph refusing them communication,railroads roads stonily ignoring their appeals for trains, Kerenskycoming, the garrison not altogether to be trusted, the Cossackswaiting to come out.... Against them not only the organisedbourgeoisie, but all the other Socialist parties except the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries, a few Mensheviki Internationalists andthe Social Democrat Internationalists, and even they undecidedwhether to stand by or not. With them, it is true, the workers andthe soldier-masses-the peasants an unknown quantity-but after allthe Bolsheviki were a political faction not rich in trained andeducated men....Riazanov was coming up the front steps, explaining in a sort ofhumorous panic that he, Commissar of Commerce, knew nothing whateverof business. In the upstairs cafe sat a man all by himself in thecorner, in a goat-skin cape and clothes which had been-I was goingto say "slept in," but of course he hadn't slept-and a three days'growth of beard. He was anxiously figuring on a dirty envelope, andbiting his pencil meanwhile. This was Menzhinsky, Commissar ofFinance, whose qualifications were that he had once been clerk in aFrench bank.... And these four half-running down the hall from theoffice of the Military Revolutionary Committee, and scribbling onbits of paper as they run-these were Commissars despatched to thefour corners of Russia to carry the news, argue, or fight-withwhatever arguments or weapons came to hand....The Congress was to meet at one o'clock, and long since the greatmeeting-hall had filled, but by seven there was yet no sign of thepresidium.... The Bolshevik and Left Social Revolutionary factionswere in session in their own rooms. All the livelong afternoon Leninand Trotzky had fought against compromise. A considerable part ofthe Bolsheviki were in favour of giving way so far as to create ajoint all-Socialist government. "We can't hold on!" they cried."Too much is against us. We haven't got the men. We will beisolated, and the whole thing will fall." So Kameniev, Riazanov andothers.But Lenin, with Trotzky beside him, stood firm as a rock. "Let thecompromisers accept our programme and they can come in! We won'tgive way an inch. If there are comrades here who haven't the courageand the will to dare what we dare, let them leave with the rest ofthe cowards and conciliators! Backed by the workers and soldiers weshall go on."At five minutes past seven came word from the left SocialistRevolutionaries to say that they would remain in the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee."See!" said Lenin. "They are following!"A little later, as we sat at the press table in the big hall, anAnarchist who was writing for the bourgeois papers proposed to methat we go and find out what had become of the presidium. There wasnobody in the _Tsay-ee-kah_ office, nor in the bureau of thePetrograd Soviet. From room to room we wandered, through vastSmolny. Nobody seemed to have the slightest idea where to find thegoverning body of the Congress. As we went my companion describedhis ancient revolutionary activities, his long and pleasant exile inFrance.... As for the Bolsheviki, he confided to me that they werecommon, rude, ignorant persons, without aesthetic sensibilities. Hewas a real specimen of the Russian _intelligentzia_.... So he came atlast to Room 17, office of the Military Revolutionary Committee, andstood there in the midst of all the furious coming and going. Thedoor opened, and out shot a squat, flat-faced man in a uniformwithout insignia, who seemed to be smiling-which smile, after aminute, one saw to be the fixed grin of extreme fatigue. It wasKrylenko.My friend, who was a dapper, civilized-looking young man, gave a cryof pleasure and stepped forward."Nicolai Vasilievitch!" he said, holding out his hand. "Don't youremember me, comrade? We were in prison together."Krylenko made an effort and concentrated his mind and sight. "Whyyes," he answered finally, looking the other up and down with anexpression of great friendliness. "You are S-. _Zdra'stvuitye!_"They kissed. "What are you doing in all this?" He waved his armaround."Oh, I'am just looking on.... You seem very successful.""Yes," replied Krylenko, with a sort of doggedness, "The proletarianRevolution is a great success." He laughed. "Perhaps-perhaps,however, we'll meet in prison again!"When we got out into the corridor again my friend went on with hisexplanations. "You see, I'am a follower of Kropotkin. To us theRevolution is a great failure; it has not aroused the patriotism ofthe masses. Of course that only proves that the people are not readyfor Revolution...."It was just 8.40 when a thundering wave of cheers announced theentrance of the presidium, with Lenin-great Lenin-among them. Ashort, stocky figure, with a big head set down in his shoulders,bald and bulging. Little eyes, a snubbish nose, wide, generousmouth, and heavy chin; clean-shaven now, but already beginning tobristle with the well-known beard of his past and future. Dressed inshabby clothes, his trousers much too long for him. Unimpressive, tobe the idol of a mob, loved and revered as perhaps few leaders inhistory have been. A strange popular leader-a leader purely byvirtue of intellect; colourless, humourless, uncompromising anddetached, without picturesque idiosyncrasies-but with the power ofexplaining profound ideas in simple terms, of analysing a concretesituation. And combined with shrewdness, the greatest intellectualaudacity.Kameniev was reading the report of the actions of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee; abolition of capital punishment in theArmy, restoration of the free right of propaganda, release ofofficers and soldiers arrested for political crimes, orders toarrest Kerensky and confiscation of food supplies in privatestore-houses.... Tremendous applause.Again the representative of the _Bund._ The uncompromising attitudeof the Bolsheviki would mean the crushing of the Revolution;therefore, the _Bund_ delegates must refuse any longer to sit in theCongress. Cries from the audience, "We thought you walked out lastnight! How many times are you going to walk out?"Then the representative of the Mensheviki Internationalists. Shouts,"What! You here still?" The speaker explained that only part of theMensheviki Internationalists left the Congress; the rest were goingto stay-"We consider it dangerous and perhaps even mortal for the Revolutionto transfer the power to the Soviets"-Interruptions-"but we feel itour duty to remain in the Congress and vote against the transferhere!"Other speakers followed, apparently without any order. A delegate ofthe coal-miners of the Don Basin called upon the Congress to takemeasures against Kaledin, who might cut off coal and food from thecapital. Several soldiers just arrived from the Front brought theenthusiastic greetings of their regiments.... Now Lenin, gripping theedge of the reading stand, letting his little winking eyes travelover the crowd as he stood there waiting, apparently oblivious tothe long-rolling ovation, which lasted several minutes. When itfinished, he said simply, "We shall now proceed to construct theSocialist order!" Again that overwhelming human roar."The first thing is the adoption of practical measures to realisepeace.... We shall offer peace to the peoples of all the belligerentcountries upon the basis of the Soviet terms-no annexations, noindemnities, and the right of self-determination of peoples. At thesame time, according to our promise, we shall publish and repudiatethe secret treaties.... The question of War and Peace is so clear thatI think that I may, without preamble, read the project of aProclamation to the Peoples of All the Belligerent Countries...."His great mouth, seeming to smile, opened wide as he spoke; hisvoice was hoarse-not unpleasantly so, but as if it had hardened thatway after years and years of speaking-and went on monotonously, withthe effect of being able to go on forever.... For emphasis he bentforward slightly. No gestures. And before him, a thousand simplefaces looking up in intent adoration.PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS OF ALL THE BELLIGERENTNATIONS.The Workers' and Peasants' Government, created by the revolution ofNovember 6th and 7th and based on the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers'and Peasants' Deputies, proposes to all the belligerent peoples andto their Governments to begin immediately negotiations for a justand democratic peace.The Government means by a just and democratic peace, which isdesired by the immense majority of the workers and the labouringclasses, exhausted and depleted by the war-that peace which theRussian workers and peasants, after having struck down the Tsaristmonarchy, have not ceased to demand categorically-immediate peacewithout annexations (that is to say, without conquest of foreignterritory, without forcible annexation of other nationalities), andwithout indemnities.The Government of Russia Proposes to all the belligerent peoplesimmediately to conclude such a peace, by showing themselves willingto enter upon the decisive steps of negotiations aiming at such apeace, at once, without the slightest delay, before the definitiveratification of all the conditions of such a peace by the authorisedassemblies of the people of all countries and of all nationalities.By annexation or conquest of foreign territory, the Governmentmeans-conformably to the conception of democratic rights in general,and the rights of the working-class in particular-all union to agreat and strong State of a small or weak nationality, without thevoluntary, clear and precise expression of its consent and desire;whatever be the moment when such an annexation by force wasaccomplished, whatever be the degree civilisation of the nationannexed by force or maintained outside the frontiers of anotherState, no matter if that nation be in Europe or in the far countriesacross the sea.If any nation is retained by force within the limits of anotherState; if, in spite of the desire expressed by it, (it matterslittle if that desire be expressed by the press, by popularmeetings, decisions of political parties, or by disorders and riotsagainst national oppression), that nation is not given the right ofdeciding by free vote-without the slightest constraint, after thecomplete departure of the armed forces of the nation which hasannexed it or wishes to annex it or is stronger in general-the formof its national and political organisation, such a union constitutesan annexation-that is to say, conquest and an act of violence.To continue this war in order to permit the strong and rich nationsto divide among themselves the weak and conquered nationalities isconsidered by the Government the greatest possible crime againsthumanity; and the Government solemnly proclaims its decision to signa treaty of peace which will put an end to this war upon the aboveconditions, equally fair for all nationalities without exception.The Government abolishes secret diplomacy, expressing before thewhole country its firm decision to conduct all the negotiations inthe light of day before the people, and will proceed immediately tothe full publication of all secret treaties confirmed or concludedby the Government of land-owners and capitalists, from March untilNovember 7th, 1917. All the clauses of the secret treaties which, asoccur in a majority of cases, have for their object to procureadvantages and privileges for Russian capitalists, to maintain oraugment the annexations of the Russian imperialists, are denouncedby the Government immediately and without discussion.In proposing to all Governments and all peoples to engage in publicnegotiations for peace, the Government declares itself ready tocarry on these negotiations by telegraph, by post, or by pourparlersbetween the representatives of the different countries, or at aconference of these representatives. To facilitate thesepourparlers, the Government appoints its authorised representativesin the neutral countries.The Government proposes to all the governments and to the peoples ofall the belligerent countries to conclude an immediate armistice, atthe same time suggesting that the armistice ought to last threemonths, during which time it is perfectly possible, not only to holdthe necessary pourparlers between the representatives of all thenations and nationalities without exception drawn into the war orforced to take part in it, but also to convoke authorised assembliesof representatives of the people of all countries, for the purposeof the definite acceptance of the conditions of peace.In addressing this offer of peace to the Governments and to thepeoples of all the belligerent countries, the Provisional Workers'and Peasants' Government of Russia addresses equally and inparticular the conscious workers of the three nations most devotedto humanity and the three most important nations among those takingpart in the present war-England, France, and Germany. The workers ofthese countries have rendered the greatest services to the cause ofprogress and of Socialism. The splendid examples of the Chartistmovement in England, the series of revolutions, of world-widehistorical significance, accomplished by the French proletariat-andfinally, in Germany, the historic struggle against the Laws ofException, an example for the workers of the whole world ofprolonged and stubborn action, and the creation of the formidableorganisations of German proletarians-all these models of proletarianheroism, these monuments of history, are for us a sure guaranteethat the workers of these countries will understand the duty imposedupon them to liberate humanity from the horrors and consequences ofwar; and that these workers, by decisive, energetic and continuedaction, will help us to bring to a successful conclusion the causeof peace-and at the same time, the cause of the liberation of theexploited working masses from all slavery and all exploitation.When the grave thunder of applause had died away, Lenin spoke again:"We propose to the Congress to ratify this declaration. We addressourselves to the Governments as well as to the peoples, for adeclaration which would be addressed only to the peoples of thebelligerent countries might delay the conclusion of peace. Theconditions of peace, drawn up during the armistice, will be ratifiedby the Constituent Assembly. In fixing the duration of the armisticeat three months, we desire to give to the peoples as long a rest aspossible after this bloody extermination, and ample time for them toelect their representatives. This proposal of peace will meet withresistance on the part of the imperialist governments-we don't foolourselves on that score. But we hope that revolution will soon breakout in all the belligerent countries; that is why we addressourselves especially to the workers of France, England and Germany...."The revolution of November 6th and 7th," he ended, "has opened theera of the Social Revolution.... The labour movement, in the name ofpeace and Socialism, shall win, and fulfil its destiny....There was something quiet and powerful in all this, which stirredthe souls of men. It was understandable why people believed whenLenin spoke...."By crowd vote it was quickly decided that only representatives ofpolitical factions should be allowed to speak on the motion and thatspeakers should be limited to fifteen minutes.First Karelin for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. "Our factionhad no opportunity to propose amendments to the text of theproclamation; it is a private document of the Bolsheviki. But wewill vote for it because we agree with its spirit...."For the Social Democrats Internationalists Kramarov, long,stoop-shouldered and near-sighted-destined to achieve some notorietyas the Clown of the Opposition. Only a Government composed of allthe Socialist parties, he said, could possess the authority to takesuch important action. If a Socialist coalition were formed, hisfaction would support the entire programme; if not, only part of it.As for the proclamation, the Internationalists were in thoroughaccord with its main points....Then one after another, amid rising enthusiasm; Ukrainean SocialDemocracy, support; Lithuanian Social Democracy, support; PopulistSocialists, support; Polish Social Democracy, support; PolishSocialists support-but would prefer a Socialist coalition; LettishSocial Democracy, support.... Something was kindled in these men. Onespoke of the "coming World-Revolution, of which we are theadvance-guard"; another of "the new age of brotherhood, when all thepeoples will become one great family...." An individual member claimedthe floor. "There is contradiction here," he said. "First you offerpeace without annexations and indemnities, and then you say you willconsider all peace offers. To consider means to accept...."Lenin was on his feet. "We want a just peace, but we are not afraidof a revolutionary war.... Probably the imperialist Governments willnot answer our appeal-but we shall not issue an ultimatum to whichit will be easy to say no.... If the German proletariat realises thatwe are ready to consider all offers of peace, that will perhaps bethe last drop which overflows the bowl-revolution will break out inGermany...."We consent to examine all conditions of peace, but that doesn'tmean that we shall accept them.... For some of our terms we shallfight to the end-but possibly for others will find it impossible tocontinue the war.... Above all, we want to finish the war...."It was exactly 10:35 when Kameniev asked all in favour of theproclamation to hold up their cards. One delegate dared to raise hishand against, but the sudden sharp outburst around him brought itswiftly down.... Unanimous.Suddenly, by common impulse, we found ourselves on our feet,mumbling together into the smooth lifting unison of the_Internationale._ A grizzled old soldier was sobbing like a child.Alexandra Kollontai rapidly winked the tears back. The immense soundrolled through the hall, burst windows and doors and seared into thequiet sky. "The war is ended! The war is ended!" said a youngworkman near me, his face shining. And when it was over, as we stoodthere in a kind of awkward hush, some one in the back of the room     ck of the room     |          |shouted, "Comrades! Let us remember those who have died forliberty!" So we began to sing the Funeral March, that slow,melancholy and yet triumphant chant, so Russian and so moving. The_Internationale_ is an alien air, after all. The Funeral Marchseemed the very soul of those dark masses whose delegates sat inthis hall, building from their obscure visions a new Russia-andperhaps more.You fell in the fatal fightFor the liberty of the people, for the honour of the people....You gave up your lives and everything dear to you,You suffered in horrible prisons,You went to exile in chains....Without a word you carried your chains because you could not ignoreyour suffering brothers,Because you believed that justice is stronger than the sword....The time will come when your surrendered life will countThat time is near; when tyranny falls the people will rise, greatand free!Farewell, brothers, you chose a noble path,You are followed by the new and fresh army ready to die and tosuffer....Farewell, brothers, you chose a noble path,At your grave we swear to fight, to work for freedom and thepeople's happiness....For this did they lie there, the martyrs of March, in their coldBrotherhood Grave on Mars Field; for this thousands and tens ofthousands had died in the prisons, in exile, in Siberian mines. Ithad not come as they expected it would come, nor as the_intelligentzia_ desired it; but it had come-rough, strong,impatient of formulas, contemptuous of sentimentalism; real....Lenin was reading the Decree on Land:(1.) All private ownership of land is abolished immediately withoutcompensation.(2.) All land_owners' estates, and all lands belonging to the Crown,to monasteries, church lands with all their live stock andinventoried property, buildings and all appurtenances, aretransferred to the disposition of the township Land Committees andthe district Soviets of Peasants' Deputies until the ConstituentAssembly meets.(3.) Any damage whatever done to the confiscated property which fromnow on belongs to the whole People, is regarded as a serious crime,punishable by the revolutionary tribunals. The district Soviets ofPeasants' Deputies shall take all necessary measures for theobservance of the strictest order during the taking over of theland-owners' estates, for the determination of the dimensions of theplots of land and which of them are subject to confiscation, for thedrawing up of an inventory of the entire confiscated property, andfor the strictest revolutionary protection of all the farmingproperty on the land, with all buildings, implements, cattle,supplies of products, etc., passing into the hands of the People.(4.) For guidance during the realisation of the great land reformsuntil their final resolution by the Constituent Assembly, shallserve the following peasant _nakaz_ (See App. V, Sect. 3)(instructions), drawn up on the basis of 242 local peasant _nakazi_by the editorial board of the "_Izviestia_ of the All-Russian Sovietof Peasants' Deputies," and published in No.88 of said _"Izviestia"_(Petrograd, No.88, August 19th, 1917).The lands of peasants and of Cossacks serving in the Army shall notbe confiscated."This is not," explained Lenin, "the project of former MinisterTchernov, who spoke of 'erecting a frame-work' and tried to realisereforms from above. From below, on the spot, will be decided thequestions of division of the land. The amount of land received byeach peasant will vary according to the locality...."Under the Provisional Government, the _pomieshtchiki_ flatlyrefused to obey the orders of the Land Committees-those LandCommittees projected by Lvov, brought into existence by Shingariov,and administered by Kerensky!"Before the debates could begin a man forced his way violentlythrough the crowd in the aisle and climbed upon the platform. It wasPianikh, member of the Executive Committee of the Peasants' Soviets,and he was mad clean through."The Executive Committee of the All-Russian Soviets of Peasants'Deputies protests against the arrest of our comrades, the MinistersSalazkin and Mazlov!" he flung harshly in the faces of the crowd,"We demand their instant release! They are now in Peter-Paulfortress. We must have immediate action! There is not a moment tolose!"Another followed him, a soldier with disordered beard and flamingeyes. "You sit here and talk about giving the land to the peasants,and you commit an act of tyrants and usurpers against the peasants'chosen representatives! I tell you-" he raised his fist, "If onehair of their heads is harmed, you'll have a revolt on your hands!"The crowd stirred confusedly.Then up rose Trotzky, calm and venomous, conscious of power, greetedwith a roar. "Yesterday the Military Revolutionary Committee decidedto release the Socialist Revolutionary and Menshevik Ministers,Mazlov, Salazkin, Gvozdov and Maliantovitch-on principle. That theyare still in Peter-Paul is only because we have had so much to do....They will, however, be detained at their homes under arrest until wehave investigated their complicity in the treacherous acts ofKerensky during the Kornilov affair!""Never," shouted Pianikh, "in any revolution have such things beenseen as go on here!""You are mistaken," responded Trotzky. "Such things have been seeneven in this revolution. Hundreds of our comrades were arrested inthe July days.... When Comrade Kollontai was released from prison bythe doctor's orders, Avksentiev placed at her door two former agentsof the Tsar's secret police!" The peasants withdrew, muttering,followed by ironical hoots.The representative of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries spoke onthe Land Decree. While agreeing in principle, his faction could notvote on the question until after discussion. The Peasants' Sovietsshould be consulted....The Mensheviki Internationalists, too, insisted on a party caucus.Then the leader of the Maximalists, the Anarchist wing of thepeasants: "We must do honour to a political party which puts such anact into effect the first day, without jawing about it!"A typical peasant was in the tribune, long hair, boots andsheep-skin coat, bowing to all corners of the hall. "I wish youwell, comrades and citizens," he said. "There are some Cadetswalking around outside. You arrested our Socialist peasants-why notarrest them?"This was the signal for a debate of excited peasants. It wasprecisely like the debate of soldiers of the night before. Here werethe real proletarians of the land...."Those members of our Executive Committee, Avksentiev and the rest,whom we thought were the peasants' protectors-they are only Cadetstoo! Arrest them! Arrest them!"Another, "Who are these Pianikhs, these Avksentievs? They are notpeasants at all! They only wag their tails!"How the crowd rose to them, recognising brothers!The Left Socialist Revolutionaries proposed a half-hourintermission. As the delegates streamed out, Lenin stood up in hisplace."We must not lose time, comrades! News all-important to Russia mustbe on the press to-morrow morning. No delay!"And above the hot discussion, argument, shuffling of feet could beheard the voice of an emissary of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, crying, "Fifteen agitators wanted in room 17 at once! Togo to the Front!"hellip;It was almost two hours and a half later that the delegates camestraggling back, the presidium mounted the platform, and the sessionrecommenced by the reading of telegrams from regiment afterregiment, announcing their adhesion to the Military RevolutionaryCommittee.In leisurely manner the meeting gathered momentum. A delegate fromthe Russian troops on the Macedonian front spoke bitterly of theirsituation. "We suffer there more from the friendship of our 'Allies'than from the enemy," he said. Representatives of the Tenth andTwelfth Armies, just arrived in hot haste, reported, "We support youwith all our strength!" A peasant-soldier protested against therelease of "the traitor Socialists, Mazlov and Salazkin"; as for theExecutive Committee of the Peasants' Soviets, it should be arrested_en masse!_Here was real revolutionary talk.... A deputy from theRussian Army in Persia declared he was instructed to demand allpower to the Soviets.... A Ukrainean officer, speaking in his nativetongue: "There is no nationalism in this crisis.... _Da zdravstvuyet_the proletarian dictatorship of all lands!" Such a deluge of highand hot thoughts that surely Russia would never again be dumb!Kameniev remarked that the anti-Bolshevik forces were trying to stirup disorders everywhere, and read an appeal of the Congress to allthe Soviets of Russia:The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies, including some Peasants' Deputies, calls upon the localSoviets to take immediate energetic measures to oppose allcounter-revolutionary anti-Jewish action and all _pogroms,_ whateverthey may be. The honour of the Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers'Revolution demands that no _pogrom_ be tolerated.The Red Guard of Petrograd, the revolutionary garrison and thesailors have maintained complete order in the capital.Workers, soldiers and peasants, you should follow everywhere theexample of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd.Comrade soldiers and Cossacks, on us falls the duty of assuring realrevolutionary order.All revolutionary Russia and the entire world have their eyes on us....At two o'clock the Land Decree was put to vote, with only oneagainst and the peasant delegates wild with joy.... So plunged theBolsheviki ahead, irresistible, over-riding hesitation andopposition-the only people in Russia who had a definite programme ofaction while the others talked for eight long months.Now arose a soldier, gaunt, ragged and eloquent, to protest againstthe clause of the _nakaz_ tending to deprive military deserters froma share in village land allotments. Bawled at and hissed at first,his simple, moving speech finally made silence. "Forced against hiswill into the butchery of the trenches," he cried, "which youyourselves, in the Peace decree, have voted senseless as well ashorrible, he greeted the Revolution with hope of peace and freedom.Peace? The Government of Kerensky forced him again to go forwardinto Galicia to slaughter and be slaughtered; to his pleas forpeace, Terestchenko simply laughed.... Freedom? Under Kerensky hefound his Committees suppressed, his newspapers cut off, his partyspeakers put in prison.... At home in his village, the landlords weredefying his Land Committees, jailing his comrades.... In Petrograd thebourgeoisie, in alliance with the Germans, were sabotaging the foodand ammunition for the Army.... He was without boots, or clothes.... Whoforced him to desert? The Government of Kerensky, which you haveoverthrown!" At the end there was applause.But another soldier hotly denounced it: "The Government of Kerenskyis not a screen behind which can be hidden dirty work likedesertion! Deserters are scoundrels, who run away home and leavetheir comrades to die in the trenches alone! Every deserter is atraitor, and should be punished...." Uproar, shouts of _"Do volno!Teesche!"_ Kameniev hastily proposed to leave the matter to theGovernment for decision. (See App. V, Sect. 4)At 2.30 A. M. fell a tense hush. Kameniev was reading the decree ofthe Constitution of Power:Until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly, a provisionalWorkers' and Peasants' Government is formed, which shall be namedthe Council of People's Commissars. (See App. V, Sect. 5)The administration of the different branches of state activity shallbe intrusted to commissions, whose composition shall be regulated toensure the carrying out of the programme of the Congress, in closeunion with the mass-organisations of working-men, working-women,sailors, soldiers, peasants and clerical employees. The governmentalpower is vested in a _collegium_ made up of the chairmen of thesecommissions, that is to say, the Council of People's Commissars.Control over the activities of the People's Commissars, and theright to replace them, shall belong to the All-Russian Congress ofSoviets of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies, and itsCentral Executive Committee.Still silence; as he read the list of Commissars, bursts of applauseafter each name, Lenin's and Trotzky's especially._President of the Council:_ Vladimir Ulianov _(Lenin)__Interior:_ A. E. Rykov_Agriculture:_ V. P. Miliutin_Labour:_ A. G. Shliapnikov_Military and Naval Affairs_-a committee composed of V. A._Avseenko (Antonov),_ N. V. Krylenko, and F. M. Dybenko._Commerce and Industry:_ V. P. Nogin_Popular Education:_ A. V. Lunatcharsky_Finance:_ E. E. Skvortsov _(Stepanov)__Foreign Affairs:_ L. D. Bronstein _(Trotzky)__Justice:_ G. E. Oppokov _(Lomov)__Supplies:_ E. A. Teodorovitch_Post and Telegraph:_ N. P. Avilov _(Gliebov)__Chairman for Nationalities:_ I. V. Djougashvili _(Stalin)__Railroads:_ To be filled later.There were bayonets at the edges of the room, bayonets pricking upamong the delegates; the Military Revolutionary Committee was armingeverybody, Bolshevism was arming for the decisive battle withKerensky, the sound of whose trumpets came up the south-west wind....In the meanwhile nobody went home; on the contrary hundreds ofnewcomers filtered in, filling the great room solid with stern-facedsoldiers and workmen who stood for hours and hours, indefatigablyintent. The air was thick with cigarette smoke, and human breathing,and the smell of coarse clothes and sweat.Avilov of the staff of _Novaya Zhizn_ was speaking in the name ofthe Social Democrat Internationalists and the remnant of theMensheviki Internationalists; Avilov, with his young, intelligentface, looking out of place in his smart frock-coat."We must ask ourselves where we are going.... The ease with which theCoalition Government was upset cannot be explained by the strengthof the left wing of the democracy, but only by the incapacity of theGovernment to give the people peace and bread. And the left wingcannot maintain itself in power unless it can solve these questions...."Can it give bread to the people? Grain is scarce. The majority ofthe peasants will not be with you, for you cannot give them themachinery they need. Fuel and other primary necessities are almostimpossible to procure...."As for peace, that will be even more difficult. The allies refusedto talk with Skobeliev. They will never accept the proposition of apeace conference from _you._ You will not be recognised either inLondon and Paris, or in Berlin...."You cannot count on the effective help of the proletariat of theAllied countries, because in most countries it is very far from therevolutionary struggle; remember, the Allied democracy was unableeven to convoke the Stockholm Conference. Concerning the GermanSocial Democrats, I have just talked with Comrade Goldenberg, one ofour delegates to Stockholm; he was told by the representatives ofthe Extreme Left that revolution in Germany was impossible duringthe war...." Here interruptions began to come thick and fast, butAvilov kept on."The isolation of Russia will fatally result either in the defeat ofthe Russian Army by the Germans, and the patching up of a peacebetween the Austro-German coalition and the Franco-British coalition_at the expense of Russia_-or in a separate peace with Germany."I have just learned that the Allied ambassadors are preparing toleave, and that Committees for Salvation of Country and Revolutionare forming in all the cities of Russia...."No one party can conquer these enormous difficulties. The majorityof the people, supporting a government of Socialist coalition, canalone accomplish the Revolution...."He then read the resolution of the two factions:Recognising that for the salvation of the conquests of theRevolution it is indispensable immediately to constitute agovernment based on the revolutionary democracy organised in theSoviets of Workers,' Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, recognisingmoreover that the task of this government is the quickest possibleattainment of peace, the transfer of the land into the hands of theagrarian committees, the organisation of control over industrialproduction, and the convocation of the Constituent Assembly on thedate decided, the Congress appoints an executive committee toconstitute such a government after an agreement with the groups ofthe democracy which are taking part in the Congress.In spite of the revolutionary exaltation of the triumphant crowd,Avilov's cool tolerant reasoning had shaken them. Toward the end,the cries and hisses died away, and when he finished there was evensome clapping.Karelin followed him-also young, fearless, whose sincerity no onedoubted-for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, the party of MariaSpiridonova, the party which almost alone followed the Bolsheviki,and which represented the revolutionary peasants."Our party has refused to enter the Council of People's Commissarsbecause we do not wish forever to separate ourselves from the partof the revolutionary army which left the Congress, a separationwhich would make it impossible for us to serve as intermediariesbetween the Bolsheviki and the other groups of the democracy.... Andthat is our principal duty at this moment. We cannot sustain anygovernment except a government of Socialist coalition...."We protest, moreover, against the tyrannical conduct of theBolsheviki. Our Commissars have been driven from their posts. Ouronly organ, _Znamia Truda_ (Banner of Labour), was forbidden toappear yesterday...."The Central Duma is forming a powerful Committee for Salvation ofCountry and Revolution, to fight you. Already you are isolated, andyour Government is without the support of a single other democraticgroup....And now Trotzky stood upon the raised tribune, confident anddominating, with that sarcastic expression about his mouth which wasalmost a sneer. He spoke, in a ringing voice, and the great crowdrose to him."These considerations on the dangers of isolation of our party arenot new. On the eve of insurrection our fatal defeat was alsopredicted. Everybody was against us; only a faction of the SocialistRevolutionaries of the left was with us in the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee. How is it that we were able to overturn theGovernment almost without bloodshed?.... That fact is the moststriking proof that we _were not isolated._ In reality theProvisional Government was isolated; the democratic parties whichmarch against us were isolated, are isolated, and forever cut offfrom the proletariat!"They speak of the necessity for a coalition. There is only onecoalition possible-the coalition of the workers, soldiers andpoorest peasants; and it is our party's honour to have realised thatcoalition.... What sort of coalition did Avilov mean? A coalition withthose who supported the Government of Treason to the People?Coalition doesn't always add to strength. For example, could we haveorganised the insurrection with Dan and Avksentiev in our ranks?"Roars of laughter."Avksentiev gave little bread. Will a coalition with the _oborontsi_furnish more? Between the peasants and Avksentiev, who ordered thearrest of the Land Committees, we choose the peasants! OurRevolution will remain the classic revolution of history...."They accuse us of repelling an agreement with the other democraticparties. But is it we who are to blame? Or must we, as Karelin putit, blame it on a 'misunderstanding'? No, comrades. When a party infull tide of revolution, still wreathed in powder-smoke, comes tosay, 'Here is the Power-take it!'-and when those to whom it isoffered go over to the enemy, that is not a misunderstanding.... thatis a declaration of pitiless war. And it isn't we who have declaredwar...."Avilov menaces us with failure of our peace efforts-if we remain'isolated.' I repeat, I don't see how a coalition with Skobeliev, oreven Terestchenko, can help us to get peace! Avilov tries tofrighten us by the threat of a peace at our expense. And I answerthat in any case, if Europe continues to be ruled by the imperialistbourgeoisie, revolutionary Russia will inevitably be lost...."There are only two alternatives; either the Russian Revolution willcreate a revolutionary movement in Europe, or the European powerswill destroy the Russian Revolution!"They greeted him with an immense crusading acclaim, kindling to thedaring of it, with the thought of championing mankind. And from thatmoment there was something conscious and decided about theinsurrectionary masses, in all their actions, which never left them.But on the other side, too, battle was taking form. Kamenievrecognised a delegate from the Union of Railway Workers, ahardfaced, stocky man with an attitude of implacable hostility. Hethrew a bombshell."In the name of the strongest organisation in Russia I demand theright to speak, and I say to you: the _Vikzhel_charges me to makeknown the decision of the Union concerning the constitution ofPower. The Central Committee refuses absolutely to support theBolsheviki if they persist in isolating themselves from the wholedemocracy of Russia!" Immense tumult all over the hall."In 1905, and in the Kornilov days, the Railway Workers were thebest defenders of the Revolution. But you did not invite us to yourCongress-" Cries, "It was the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ which did not inviteyou!" The orator paid no attention. "We do not recognise thelegality of this Congress; since the departure of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries there is not a legal quorum.... The Unionsupports the old _Tsay-ee-Kah,_ and declares that the Congress hasno right to elect a new Committee...."The Power should be a Socialist and revolutionary Power,responsible before the authorised organs of the entire revolutionarydemocracy. Until the constitution of such a power, the Union ofRailway Workers, which refuses to transport counter-revolutionarytroops to Petrograd, at the same time forbids the execution of anyorder whatever without the consent of the _Vikzhel._ The _Vikzhel_also takes into its hands the entire administration of the railroadsof Russia."At the end he could hardly be heard for the furious storm of abusewhich beat upon him. But it was a heavy blow-that could be seen inthe concern on the faces of the presidium. Kameniev, however, merelyanswered that there could be no doubt of the legality of theCongress, as even the quorum established by the old _Tsay-ee-Kah_was exceeded-in spite of the secession of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolution arises....Then came the vote on the Constitution of Power, which carried theCouncil of People's Commissars into office by an enormous majority....The election of the new _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the new parliament of theRussian Republic, took barely fifteen minutes. Trotzky announced itscomposition: 100 members, of which 70 Bolsheviki.... As for thepeasants, and the seceding factions, places were to be reserved forthem. "We welcome into the Government all parties and groups whichwill adopt our programme," ended Trotzky.And thereupon the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets wasdissolved, so that the members might hurry to their homes in thefour corners of Russia and tell of the great happenings....It was almost seven when we woke the sleeping conductors andmotor-men of the street-cars which the Street-Railway Workers' Unionalways kept waiting at Smolny to take the Soviet delegates to theirhomes. In the crowded car there was less happy hilarity than thenight before, I thought. Many looked anxious; perhaps they weresaying to themselves, "Now we are masters, how can we do our will?"At our apartment-house we were held up in the dark by an armedpatrol of citizens and carefully examined. The Duma's proclamationwas doing its work....The landlady heard us come in, and stumbled out in a pink silkwrapper.The House Committee has again asked that you take your turn onguard-duty with the rest of the men," she said."What's the reason for this guard-duty?""To protect the house and the women and children.""Who from?""Robbers and murderers.""But suppose there came a Commissar from the Military RevolutionaryCommittee to search for arms?""Oh, that's what they'll _say_ they are.... And besides, what's thedifference?"I solemnly affirmed that the Consul had forbidden all Americancitizens to carry arms-especially in the neighbourhood of theRussian _intelligentzia_....                              Chapter VI                      The Committee for SalvationFRIDAY, November 9th....Novotcherkask, November 8th.In view of the revolt of the Bolsheviki, and their attempt to deposethe Provisional Government and to seize the power in Petrograd... theCossack Government declares that it considers these acts criminaland absolutely inadmissible. In consequence, the Cossacks will lendall their support to the Provisional Government, which is agovernment of coalition. Because of these circumstances, and untilthe return of the Provisional Government to power, and therestoration of order in Russia, I take upon myself, beginningNovember 7th, all the power in that which concerns the region of theDon.Signed: ATAMAN KALEDIN_President of the Government of the Cossack Troops.__Prikaz_ of the Minister-President Kerensky, dated at Gatchina:I, Minister-President of the Provisional Government, and SupremeCommander of all the armed forces of the Russian Republic, declarethat I am at the head of regiments from the Front who have remainedfaithful to the fatherland.I order all the troops of the Military District of Petrograd, whothrough mistake or folly have answered the appeal of the traitors tothe country and the Revolution, to return to their duty withoutdelay.This order shall be read in all regiments, battalions and squadrons.Signed: _Minister-President of the Provisional__Government and Supreme Commander_A. F. KERENSKY.Telegram from Kerensky to the General in Command of the NorthernFront:The town of Gatchina has been taken by the loyal regiments withoutbloodshed. Detachments of Cronstadt sailors, and of the Semionovskyand Ismailovsky regiments, gave up their arms without resistance andjoined the Government troops.I order all the designated units to advance as quickly as possible.The Military Revolutionary Committee has ordered its troops toretreat....Gatchina, about thirty kilometers south-west, had fallen during thenight. Detachments of the two regiments mentioned-not thesailors-while wandering captainless in the neighbourhood, had indeedbeen surrounded by Cossacks and given up their arms; but it was nottrue that they had joined the Government troops. At this very momentcrowds of them, bewildered and ashamed, were up at Smolny trying toexplain. They did not think the Cossacks were so near.... They hadtried to argue with the Cossacks....Apparently the greatest confusion prevailed along the revolutionaryfront. The garrisons of all the little towns southward had splithopelessly, bitterly into two factions-or three: the high commandbeing on the side of Kerensky, in default of anything stronger, themajority of the rank and file with the Soviets, and the restunhappily wavering.Hastily the Military Revolutionary Committee appointed to commandthe defence of Petrograd an ambitious regular Army Captain,Muraviov, the same Muraviov who had organised the Death Battalionsduring the summer, and had once been heard to advise the Governmentthat "it was too lenient with the Bolsheviki; they must be wipedout." A man of military mind, who admired power and audacity,perhaps sincerely....Beside my door when I came down in the morning were posted two neworders of the Military Revolutionary Committee, directing that allshops and stores should open as usual, and that all empty rooms andapartments should be put at the disposal of the Committee....For thirty-six hours now the Bolsheviki had been cut off fromprovincial Russia and the outside world. The railway men andtelegraphers refused to transmit their despatches, the postmen wouldnot handle their mail. Only the Government wireless at TsarskoyeSelo launched half-hourly bulletins and manifestoes to the fourcorners of heaven; the Commissars of Smolny raced the Commissars ofthe City Duma on speeding trains half across the earth; and twoaeroplanes, laden with propaganda, fled high up toward the Front....But the eddies of insurrection were spreading through Russia with aswiftness surpassing any human agency. Helsingfors Soviet passedresolutions of support; Kiev Bolsheviki captured the arsenal and thetelegraph station, only to be driven out by delegates to theCongress of Cossacks, which happened to be meeting there; in Kazan,a Military Revolutionary Committee arrested the local garrison staffand the Commissar of the Provisional Government; from farKrasnoyarsk, in Siberia, came news that the Soviets were in controlof the Municipal institutions; at Moscow, where the situation wasaggravated by a great strike of leather-workers on one side, and athreat of general lock-out on the other, the Soviets had votedoverwhelmingly to support the action of the Bolsheviki inPetrograd.... Already a Military Revolutionary Committee wasfunctioning.Everywhere the same thing happened. The common soldiers and theindustrial workers supported the Soviets by a vast majority; theofficers, _yunkers_ and middle class generally were on the side ofthe Government-as were the bourgeois Cadets and the "moderate"Socialist parties. In all these towns sprang up Committees forSalvation of Country and Revolution, arming for civil war....Vast Russia was in a state of solution. As long ago as 1905 theprocess had begun; the March Revolution had merely hastened it, andgiving birth to a sort of forecast of the new order, had ended bymerely perpetuating the hollow structure of the old regime. Now,however, the Bolsheviki, in one night, had dissipated it, as oneblows away smoke. Old Russia was no more; human society flowedmolten in primal heat, and from the tossing sea of flame wasemerging the class struggle, stark and pitiless-and the fragile,slowly-cooling crust of new planets....In Petrograd sixteen Ministries were on strike, led by theMinistries of Labour and of Supplies-the only two created by theall-Socialist Government of August.If ever men stood alone the "handful of Bolsheviki" apparently stoodalone that grey chill morning, with all storms towering over them.(See App. VI, Sect. 1) Back against the wall, the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee struck-for its life. _"De l'audace, encorede l'audace, et toujours de l'audace_.... At five in the morning theRed Guards entered the printing office of the City Government,confiscated thousands of copies of the Appeal-Protest of the Duma,and suppressed the official Municipal organ-the _Viestnik GorodskovoSamoupravleniya_ (Bulletin of the Municipal Self-Government). Allthe bourgeois newspapers were torn from the presses, even the _GolosSoldata,_ journal of the old _Tsay-ee-kah_-which, however, changingits name to _Soldatski Golos,_ appeared in an edition of a hundredthousand copies, bellowing rage and defiance:The men who began their stroke of treachery in the night, who havesuppressed the newspapers, will not keep the country in ignorancelong. The country will know the truth! It will appreciate you,Messrs. the Bolsheviki! We shall see!...As we came down the Nevsky a little after midday the whole streetbefore the Duma building was crowded with people. Here and therestood Red Guards and sailors, with bayonetted rifles, each onesurrounded by about a hundred men and women-clerks, students,shopkeepers, _tchinovniki_-shaking their fists and bawling insultsand menaces. On the steps stood boy-scouts and officers,distributing copies of the _Soldatski Golos._ A workman with a redband around his arm and a revolver in his hand stood trembling withrage and nervousness in the middle of a hostile throng at the footof the stairs, demanding the surrender of the papers.... Nothing likethis, I imagine, ever occurred in history. On one side a handful ofworkmen and common soldiers, with arms in their hands, representinga victorious insurrection-and perfectly miserable; on the other afrantic mob made up of the kind of people that crowd the sidewalksof Fifth Avenue at noon-time, sneering, abusing, shouting,"Traitors! Provocators! _Opritchniki!_ [*]"[* Savage body-guards if Ian the Terrible, 17th century]The doors were guarded by students and officers with white arm-bandslettered in red, "Militia of the Committee of Public Safety," andhalf a dozen boy-scouts came and went. Upstairs the place was allcommotion. Captain Gomberg was coming down the stairs. "They'regoing to dissolve the Duma," he said. "The Bolshevik Commissar iswith the Mayor now." As we reached the top Riazanov came hurryingout. He had been to demand that the Duma recognise the Council ofpeoples' Commissars, and the Mayor had given him a flat refusal.In the offices a great babbling crowd, hurrying, shouting,gesticulating-Government officials, intellectuals, journalists,foreign correspondents, French and British officers.... "The CityEngineer pointed to them triumphantly. "The Embassies recognise theDuma as the only power now," he explained. "For these Bolshevikmurderers and robbers it is only a question of hours. All Russia israllying to us....In the Alexander Hall a monster meeting of the Committee forSalvation. Fillipovsky in the chair and Skobeliev again in thetribune, reporting, to immense applause, new adhesions to theCommittee; Executive Committee of Peasants' Soviets, old_Tsay-ee-kah,_ Central Army Committee, _Tsentroflot,_ Menshevik,Socialist Revolutionary and Front group delegates from the Congressof Soviets, Central Committees of the Menshevik, SocialistRevolutionary, Populist Socialist parties. "Yedinstvo" group,Peasants' Union, Cooperatives, Zemstvos, Municipalities, Post andTelegraph Unions, _Vikzhel,_ Council of the Russian Republic, Unionof Unions,  [*] Merchants' and Manufacturers' Association....[* See Notes and Explanations.]".... The power of the Soviets is not democratic power, but adictatorship-and not the dictatorship of the proletariat, but_against_ the proletariat. All those who have felt or know how tofeel revolutionary enthusiasm must join now for the defence of theRevolution...."The problem of the day is not only to render harmless irresponsibledemagogues, but to fight against the counter-revolution.... If rumoursare true that certain generals in the provinces are attempting toprofit by events in order to march on Petrograd with other designs,it is only one more proof that we must establish a solid base ofdemocratic government. Otherwise, troubles with the Right willfollow troubles from the Left...."The garrison of Petrograd cannot remain indifferent when citizensbuying the _Golos Soldata_ and newsboys selling the _RabotchayaGazeta_ are arrested in the streets...."The hour of resolutions has passed.... Let those who have no longerfaith in the Revolution retire.... To establish a united power, wemust again restore the prestige of the Revolution...."Let us swear that either the Revolution shall be saved-or we shallperish!"The hall rose, cheering, with kindling eyes. There was not a singleproletarian anywhere in sight....Then Weinstein:"We must remain calm, and not act until public opinion is firmlygrouped in support of the Committee for Salvation-then we can passfrom the defensive to action!"The _Vikzhel_ representative announced that his organisation wastaking the initiative in forming the new Government, and itsdelegates were now discussing the matter with Smolny.... Followed ahot discussion: were the Bolsheviki to be admitted to the newGovernment? Martov pleaded for their admission; after all, he said,they represented an important political party. Opinions were verymuch divided upon this, the right wing Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries, as well as the Populist Socialists, theCooperatives and the bourgeois elements being bitterly against...."They have betrayed Russia," one speaker said. "They have startedcivil war and opened the front to the Germans. The Bolsheviki mustbe mercilessly crushed...."Skobeliev was in favor of excluding both the Bolsheviki and theCadets.We got into conversation with a young Socialist Revolutionary, whohad walked out of the Democratic Conference to gether with theBolsheviki, that night when Tseretelli and the "compromisers" forcedCoalition upon the democracy of Russia."You here?" I asked him.His eyes flashed fire. "Yes!" he cried. "I left the Congress with myparty Wednesday night. I have not risked my life for twenty yearsand more to submit now to the tyranny of the Dark People. Theirmethods are intolerable. But they have not counted on the peasants....When the peasants begin to act, then it is a question of minutesbefore they are done for.""But the peasants-will they act? Doesn't the Land decree settle thepeasants? What more do they want?""Ah, the Land decree!" he said furiously. "Yes, do you know whatthat Land decree is? It is _our_ decree-it is the SocialistRevolutionary programme, intact! My party framed that policy, afterthe most careful compilation of the wishes of the peasantsthemselves. It is an outrage....""But if it is your own policy, why do you object? If it is thepeasants' wishes, why will they oppose it?""You don't understand! Don't you see that the peasants willimmediately realise that it is all a trick-that these usurpers havestolen the Socialist Revolutionary programme?"I asked if it were true that Kaledin was marching north.He nodded, and rubbed his hands with a sort of bitter satisfaction."Yes. Now you see what these Bolsheviki have done. They have raisedthe counter-revolution against us. The Revolution is lost. TheRevolution is lost.""But won't you defend the Revolution?""Of course we will defend it-to the last drop of our blood. But wewon't cooperate with the Bolsheviki in any way....""But if Kaledin comes to Petrograd, and the Bolsheviki defend thecity. Won't you join with them?""Of course not. We will defend the city also, but we won't supportthe Bolsheviki. Kaledin is the enemy of the Revolution, but theBolsheviki are equally enemies of the Revolution.""Which do you prefer-Kaledin or the Bolsheviki?""It is not a question to be discussed!" he burst out impatiently. "Itell you, the Revolution is lost. And it is the Bolsheviki who areto blame. But listen-why should we talk of such things? Kerensky iscomming.... Day after tomorrow we shall pass to the offensive....Already Smolny has sent delegates inviting us to form a newGovernment. But we have them now-they are absolutely impotent.... Weshall not cooperate...."Outside there was a shot. We ran to the windows. A Red Guard,finally exasperated by the taunts of the crowd, had shot into it,wounding a young girl in the arm. We could see her being lifted intoa cab, surrounded by an excited throng, the clamour of whose voicesfloated up to us. As we looked, suddenly an armoured automobileappeared around the corner of the Mikhailovsky, its guns sluing thisway and that. Immediately the crowd began to run, as Petrogradcrowds do, falling down and lying still in the street, piled in thegutters, heaped up behind telephone-poles. The car lumbered up tothe steps of the Duma and a man stuck his head out of the turret,demanding the surrender of the _Soldatski Golos._ The boy-scoutsjeered and scuttled into the building. After a moment the automobilewheeled undecidedly around and went off up the Nevsky, while somehundreds of men and women picked themselves up and began to dusttheir clothes....Inside was a prodigious running-about of people with armfuls of_Soldatski Golos,_ looking for places to hide them....A journalist came running into the room, waving a paper."Here's a proclamation from Krasnov!" he cried. Everybody crowdedaround. "Get it printed-get it printed quick, and around to thebarracks!"By the order of the Supreme Commander I am appointed commandant ofthe troops concentrated under Petrograd.Citizens, soldiers, valorous Cossacks of the Don, of the Kuban, ofthe Transbaikal, of the Amur, of the Yenissei, to all you who haveremained faithful to your oath I appeal; to you who have sworn toguard inviolable your oath of Cossack-I call upon you to savePetrograd from anarchy, from famine, from tyranny, and to saveRussia from the indelible shame to which a handful of ignorant men,bought by the gold of Wilhelm, are trying to submit her.The Provisional Government, to which you swore fidelity in the greatdays of March, is not overthrown, but by violence expelled from theedifice in which it held its meetings. However the Government, withthe help of the Front armies, faithful to their duty, with the helpof the Council of Cossacks, which has united under its command allthe Cossacks and which, strong with the morale which reigns in itsranks, and acting in accordance with the will of the Russian people,has sworn to serve the country as its ancestors served it in theTroublous Times of 1612, when the Cossacks of the Don deliveredMoscow, menaced by the Swedes, the Poles, and the Lithuanians. YourGovernment still exists....The active army considers these criminals with horror and contempt.Their acts of vandalism and pillage, their crimes, the Germanmentality with which they regard Russia-stricken down but not yetsurrendered-have alienated from them the entire people.Citizens, soldiers, valorous Cossacks of the garrison of Petrograd;send me your delegates so that I may know who are traitors to theircountry and who are not, that there may be avoided an effusion ofinnocent blood.Almost the same moment word ran from group to group that thebuilding was surrounded by Red Guards. An officer strode in, a redband around his arm, demanding the Mayor. A few minutes later heleft and old Schreider came out of his office, red and pale by turns."A special meeting of the Duma!" he cried. "Immediately!"In the big hall proceedings were halted. "All members of the Dumafor a special meeting!""What's the matter?""I don't know-going to arrest us-going to dissolve theDuma-arresting members at the door-" so ran the excited comments.In the Nicolai Hall there was barely room to stand. The Mayorannounced that troops were stationed at all the doors, prohibitingall exit and entrance, and that a Commissar had threatened arrestand the dispersal of the Municipal Duma. A flood of impassionedspeeches from members, and even from the galleries, responded. Thefreely-elected City Government could not be dissolved by _any_power; the Mayor's person and that of all the members wereinviolable; the tyrants, the provocators, the German agents shouldnever be recognised; as for these threats to dissolve us, let themtry-only over our dead bodies shall they seize this chamber, wherelike the Roman senators of old we await with dignity the coming ofthe Goths....Resolution, to inform the Dumas and Zemstvos of all Russia bytelegraph. Resolution, that it was impossible for the Mayor or theChairman of the Duma to enter into any relations whatever withrepresentatives of the Military Revolutionary Committee or with theso-called Council of People's Commissars. Resolution, to addressanother appeal to the population of Petrograd to stand up for thedefence of their elected town government. Resolution, to remain inpermanent session....In the meanwhile one member arrived with the information that he hadtelephoned to Smolny, and that the Military Revolutionary Committeesaid that no orders had been given to surround the Duma, that thetroops would be withdrawn....As we went downstairs Riazanov burst in through the front door, veryagitated."Are you going to dissolve the Duma?" I asked."My God, no!" he answered. "It is all a mistake. I told the Mayorthis morning that the Duma would be left alone....Out on the Nevsky, in the deepening dusk, a long double file ofcyclists came riding, guns slung on their shoulders. They halted,and the crowd pressed in and deluged them with questions."Who are you? Where do you come from?" asked a fat old man with acigar in his mouth."Twelfth Army. From the front. We came to support the Sovietsagainst the damn' bourgeoisie!""Ah!" were furious cries. "Bolshevik gendarmes! Bolshevik Cossacks!"A little officer in a leather coat came running down the steps. "Thegarrison is turning!" he muttered in my ear. "It's the beginning ofthe end of the Bolsheviki. Do you want to see the turn of the tide?Come on!" He started at a half-trot up the Mikhailovsky, and wefollowed."What regiment is it?""The _brunnoviki_...." Here was indeed serious trouble. The_brunnoviki_ were the Armoured Car troops, the key to the situation;whoever controlled the _brunnoviki_ controlled the city. "TheCommissars of the Committee for Salvation and the Duma have beentalking to them. There's a meeting on to decide...."Decide what? Which side they'll fight on?""Oh, no. That's not the way to do it. They'll never fight againstthe Bolsheviki. They will vote to remain neutral-and then the_yunkers_ and Cossacks-"The door of the great Mikhailovsky Riding-School yawned blackly. Twosentinels tried to stop us, but we brushed by hurriedly, deaf totheir indignant expostulations. Inside only a single arc-lightburned dimly, high up near the roof of the enormous hall, whoselofty pilasters and rows of windows vanished in the gloom. Arounddimly squatted the monstrous shapes of the armoured cars. One stoodalone in the centre of the place, under the light, and round it weregathered some two thousand dun-colored soldiers, almost lost in theimmensity of that imperial building. A dozen men, officers, chairmenof the Soldiers' Committees and speakers, were perched on top of thecar, and from the central turret a soldier was speaking. This wasKhanjunov, who had been president of last summer's all-RussianCongress of _Brunnoviki._ A lithe, handsome figure in his leathercoat with lieutenant's shoulder-straps, he stood pleading eloquentlyfor neutrality."It is an awful thing," he said, "for Russians to kill their Russianbrothers. There must not be civil war between soldiers who stoodshoulder to shoulder against the Tsar, and conquered the foreignenemy in battles which will go down in history! What have we,soldiers, got to do with these squabbles of political parties? Iwill not say to you that the Provisional Government was a democraticGovernment; we want no coalition with the bourgeoisie-no. But wemust have a Government of the united democracy, or Russia is lost!With such a Government there will be no need for civil war, and thekilling of brother by brother!"This sounded reasonable-the great hall echoed to the crash of handsand voices.A soldier climbed up, his face white and strained, "Comrades!" hecried, "I came from the Rumanian front, to urgently tell you all:there must be peace! Peace at once! Whoever can give us peace,whether it be the Bolsheviki or this new Government, we will follow.Peace! We at the front cannot fight any longer. We cannot fighteither Germans or Russians-" With that he leaped down, and a sort ofconfused agonised sound rose up from all that surging mass, whichburst into something like anger when the next speaker, a Menshevik_oboronetz,_ tried to say that the war must go on until the Allieswere victorious."You talk like Kerensky!" shouted a rough voice.A Duma delegate, pleading for neutrality. Him they listened to,muttering uneasily, feeling him not one of them. Never have I seenmen trying so hard to understand, to decide. They never moved, stoodstaring with a sort of terrible intentness at the speaker, theirbrows wrinkled with the effort of thought, sweat standing out ontheir foreheads; great giants of men with the innocent clear eyes ofchildren and the faces of epic warriors....Now a Bolshevik was speaking, one of their own men, violently, fullof hate. They liked him no more than the other. It was not theirmood. For the moment they were lifted out of the ordinary run ofcommon thoughts, thinking in terms of Russia, of Socialism, theworld, as if it depended on them whether the Revolution were to liveor die....Speaker succeeded speaker, debating amid tense silence, roars ofapproval, or anger: should we come out or not? Khanjunov returned,persuasive and sympathetic. But wasn't he an officer, and an_oboronotz,_ however much he talked of peace? Then a workman fromVasili Ostrov, but him they greeted with, "And are _you_ going togive us peace, working-man?" Near us some men, many of themofficers, formed a sort of _claque_ to cheer the advocates ofNeutrality. They kept shouting, "Khanjunov! Khanjunov!" and whistledinsultingly when the Bolsheviki tried to speak.Suddenly the committeemen and officers on top of the automobilebegan to discuss something with great heat and much gesticulation.The audience shouted to know what was the matter, and all the greatmass tossed and stirred. A soldier, held back by one of theofficers, wrenched himself loose and held up his hand."Comrades!" he cried, "Comrade Krylenko is here and wants to speakto us." An outburst of cheers, whistlings, yells of _"Prosim!Prosim! Dolby!_ Go ahead! Go ahead! Down with him!" in the midst ofwhich the People's Commissar for Military Affairs clambered up theside of the car, helped by hands before and behind, pushed andpulled from below and above. Rising he stood for a moment, and thenwalked out on the radiator, put his hands on his hips and lookedaround smiling, a squat, short-legged figure, bare-headed, with-outinsignia on his uniform.The _claque_ near me kept up a fearful shouting, "Khanjunov! We wantKhanjunov! Down with him! Shut up! Down with the traitor!" The wholeplace seethed and roared. Then it began to move, like an avalanchebearing down upon us, great black-browed men forcing their waythrough."Who is breaking up our meeting?" they shouted. "Who is whistlinghere?" The _claque,_ rudely burst asunder, went flying-nor did itgather again...."Comrade soliders!" began Krylenko, in a voice husky with fatigue."I cannot speak well to you; I am sorry; but I have not had anysleep for four nights...."I don't need to tell you that I am a soldier. I don't need to tellyou that I want peace. What I must say is that the Bolshevik party,successful in the Workers' and Soldiers' Revolution, by the help ofyou and of all the rest of the brave comrades who have of you and ofall the rest of the brave comrades who have hurled down forever thepower of the blood-thirsty bourgeoisie, promised to offer peace toall the peoples, and that has already been done-to-day!" Tumultuousapplause."You are asked to remain neutral--to remain neutral while the_yunkers_ and the Death Battalions, who are _never_ neutral, shootus down in the streets and bring back to Petrograd Kerensky-orperhaps some other of the gang. Kaledin is marching from the Don.Kerensky is coming from the front. Kornilov is raising the_Tekhintsi_ to repeat his attempt of August. All these Menshevikiand Socialist Revolutionaries who call upon you now to prevent civilwar-how have they retained the power except by civil war, that civilwar which has endured ever since last July, and in which theyconstantly stood on the side of the bourgeoisie, as they do now?"How can I persuade you, if you have made up your minds? Thequestion is very plain. On one side are Kerensky, Kaledin, Kornilov,the Mensheviki, Socialist Revolutionaries, Cadets, Dumas, officers....They tell us that their objects are good. On the other side are theworkers, the soldiers and sailors, the poorest peasants. TheGovernment is in your hands. You are the masters. Great Russiabelongs to you. Will you give it back?"While he spoke, he kept himself up by sheer evident effort of will,and as he went on the deep sincere feeling back of his words brokethrough the tired voice. At the end he totered, almost falling; ahundred hands reached up to help him down, and the great dim spacesof the hall gave back the surf of sound that beat upon him.Khanjunov tried to speak again, but "Vote! Vote! Vote!" they cried.At length, giving in, he read the resolution: that the _brunnoviki_withdraw their representative from the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, and declare their neutrality in the present civil war.All those in favour should go to the right; those opposed, to theleft. There was a moment of hesitation, a still expectancy, and thenthe crowd began to surge faster and faster, stumbling over oneanother, to the left, hundreds of big soldiers in a solid massrushing across the dirt floor in the faint light.... Near us aboutfifty men were left stranded, stubbornly in favour, and even as thehigh roof shook under the shock of victorious roaring, they turnedand rapidly walked out of the building-and, some of them, out of theRevolution....Imagine this struggle being repeated in every barracks of the city,the district, the whole front, all Russia. Imagine the sleeplessKrylenkos, watching the regiments, hurrying from place to place,arguing, threatening, entreating. And then imaging the same in allthe locals of every labour union, in the factories, the villages, onthe battle-ships of the far-flung Russian fleets; think of thehundreds of thousands of Russian men staring up at speakers all overthe vast country, workmen, peasants, soldiers, sailors, trying sohard to understand and to choose, thinking so intensely-and decidingso unanimously at the end. So was the Russian Revolution....Up at Smolny the new Council of People's Commissars was not idle.Already the first decree was on the presses, to be circulated inthousands through the city streets that night, and shipped in balesby every train southward and east:In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic, chosen by theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputieswith participation of peasant deputies, the Council of People'sCommissars decrees:1. The elections for the Constituent Assembly shall take place atthe date determined upon-November 12.2. All electoral commissions, organs of local self-government,Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, and soldiers'organisations on the front should make every effort to assure freeand regular elections at the date determined upon.In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic, _ThePresident of the Council of People's Commissars_,VLADIMIR ULIANOV-LENIN.In the Municipal building the Duma was in full blast. A member ofthe Council of the Republic was talking as we came in. The Council,he said, did not consider itself dissolved at all, but merely unableto continue its labours until it secured a new meeting-place. In themeanwhile, its Committee of Elders had determined to enter _enmasse_ the Committee for Salvation.... This, I may remarkparenthetically, is the last time history mentions the Council ofthe Russian Republic....Then followed the customary string of delegates from the Ministries,the _Vikzhel,_ the Union of Posts and Telegraphs, for the hundredthtime reiterating their determination not to work for the Bolshevikusurpers. A _yunker_ who had been in the Winter Palace told ahighly-coloured tale of the heroism of himself and his comrades, anddisgraceful conduct of the Red Guards-all of which was devoutlybelieved. Somebody read aloud an account in the SocialistRevolutionary paper _Narod,_ which stated that five hundred millionrubles' worth of damage had been done in the Winter Palace, anddescribing in great detail the loot and breakage.From time to time couriers came from the telephone with news. Thefour Socialist Ministers had been released from prison. Krylenko hadgone to Peter-Paul to tell Admiral Verderevsky that the Ministry ofMarine was deserted, and to beg him, for the sake of Russia, to takecharge under the authority of the Council of People's Commissars;and the old seaman had consented.... Kerensky was advancing north fromGatchina, the Bolshevik garrisons falling back before him. Smolnyhad issued another decree, enlarging the powers of the City Dumas todeal with food supplies.This last piece of insolence caused an outburst of fury. He, Lenin,the usurper, the tyrant, whose Commissars had seized the Municipalgarage, entered the Municipal ware houses, were interfering with theSupply Committees and the distribution of food-he presumed to definethe limits of power of the free, independent, autonomous CityGovernment! One member, shaking his fist, moved to cut off the foodof the city if the Bolsheviki dared to interfere with the SupplyCommittees.... Another, representative of the Special SupplyCommittee, reported that the food situation was very grave, andasked that emissaries be sent out to hasten food trains.Diedonenko announced dramatically that the garrison was wavering.The Semionovsky regiment had already decided to submit to the ordersof the Socialist Revolutionary party; the crews of the torpedo-boatson the Neva were shaky. Seven members were at once appointed tocontinue the propaganda....Then the old Mayor stepped into the tribune: "Comrades and citizens!I have just learned that the prisoners in Peter Paul are in danger.Fourteen _yunkers_ of the Pavlovsk school have been stripped andtortured by the Bolshevik guards. One has gone mad. They arethreatening to lynch the Ministers!" There was a whirlwind ofindignation and horror, which only grew more violent when a stockylittle woman dressed in grey demanded the floor, and lifted up herhard, metallic voice. This was Vera Slutskaya, veteran revolutionistand Bolshevik member of the Duma."That is a lie and a provocation!" she said, unmoved at the torrentof abuse. "The Workers' and Peasants' Government, which hasabolished the death penalty, cannot permit such deeds. We demandthat this story be investigated, at once; if there is any truth init, the Government will take energetic measures!"A commission composed of members of all parties was immediatelyappointed, and with the Mayor, sent to Peter Paul to investigate. Aswe followed them out, the Duma was appointing another commission tomeet Kerensky--to try and avoid bloodshed when he entered thecapital....It was midnight when we bluffed our past the guards at the gate ofthe fortress, and went forward under the faint glimmer of rareelectric lights along the side of the church where lie the tombs ofthe Tsars, beneath the slender golden spire and the chimes, which,for months, continued to play _Bozhe Tsaria Khrani [*]_ every day at[* "God Save the Tsar."noon.... The place was deserted; in most of the windows there were noteven lights. Occasionally we bumped into a burly figure stumblingalong in the dark, who answered questions with the usual, _"Yanieznayu."_[Graphic page-166 Pass to Reed fromDepartment of Prisons   translation follows]Pass from the Department of Prisons of the Soviet Government tovisit freely all prisons of Petrograd and Cronstadt.

No. 213Petrograd, SmolnyInstitute, room No. 56-                      PASSTo the representative of the American Socialist press, JOHN REED, tovisit all places of confinement in the cities of Petrograd andCronstadt, for the purpose of generally investigating the conditionof the prisoners, and for thorough social information for thepurpose of stopping the flood of newspaper lies against demorcracy.       Chief Commissar       SecretaryOn the left loomed the low dark outline of Trubetskoi Bastion, thatliving grave in which so many martyrs of liberty had lost theirlives or their reason in the days of the Tsar, where the ProvisionalGovernment had in turn shut up the Ministers of the Tsar, and nowthe Bolsheviki had shut up the Ministers of the ProvisionalGovernment.A friendly sailor led us to the office of the commandant, in alittle house near the Mint. Half a dozen Red Guards, sailors andsoldiers were sitting around a hot room full of smoke, in which asamovar steamed cheerfully. They welcomed us with great cordiality,offering tea. The commandant was not in; he was escorting acommission of _"sabotazhniki"_ (sabotageurs) from the City Duma, whoinsisted that the _yunkers_ were all being murdered. This seemed toamuse them very much. At one side of the room sat a bald-headed,dissipated-looking little man in a frock-coat and a rich fur coat,biting his moustache and staring around him like a cornered rat. Hehad just been arrested. Somebody said, glancing carelessly at him,that he was a Minister or something.... The little man didn't seem tohear it; he was evidently terrified, although the occupants of theroom showed no animosity whatever toward him.I went across and spoke to him in French. "Count Tolstoy," heanswered, bowing stiffly. "I do not understand why I was arrested. Iwas crossing the Troitsky Bridge on my way home when two of these-ofthese-persons held me up. I was a Commissar of the ProvisionalGovernment attached to the General Staff, but in no sense a memberof the Government...""Let him go,"said a sailor. "He's harmless....""No," responded the soldier who had brought the prisoner. "We mustask the commandant.""Oh, the commandant!" sneered the sailor. "What did you make arevolution for? To go on obeying officers?"A _praporshtchik_ of the Pavlovsky regiment was telling us how theinsurrection started. "The _polk_ (regiment) was on duty at theGeneral Staff the night of the 6th. Some of my comrades and I werestanding guard; Ivan Pavlovitch and another man-I don't remember hisname-well, they hid behind the window-curtains in the room where theStaff was having a meeting, and they heard a great many things. For   any things. For   |          |example, they heard orders to bring the Gatchina _yunkers_ toPetrograd by night, and an order for the Cossacks to be ready tomarch in the morning.... The principal points in the city were to beoccupied before dawn. Then there was the business of opening thebridges. But when they began to talk about surrounding Smolny, thenIvan Pavlovitch couldn't stand it any longer. That minute there wasa good deal of coming and going, so he slipped out and came down tothe guard-room,leaving the other comrade to pick up what he could."I was already suspicious that something was going on. Automobilesfull of officers kept coming, and all the Ministers were there. IvanPavlovitch told me what he had heard. It was half-past two in themorning. The secretary of the regimental Committee was there, so wetold him and asked what to do."'Arrest everybody coming and going!#' he says. So we began to doit. In an hour we had some officers and a couple of Ministers, whomwe sent up to Smolny right away. But the Military RevolutionaryCommittee wasn't ready; they didn't know what to do; and pretty soonback came the order to let everybody go and not arrest anybody else.Well, we ran all the way to Smolny, and I guess we talked for anhour before they finally saw that it was war. It was five o'clockwhen we got back to the Staff, and by that time most of them weregone. But we got a few, and the garrison was all on the march...."A Red Guard from Vasili Ostrov described in great detail what hadhappened in his district on the great day of the rising. "We didn'thave any machine-guns over there," he said, laughing, "and wecouldn't get any from Smolny. Comrade Zalking, who was a member ofthe _Uprava_ (Central Bureau) of the Ward Duma, remembered all atonce that there was lying in the meeting-room of the _Uprava_ amachinegun which had been captured from the Germans. So he and I andanother comrade went there. The Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries were having a meeting. Well, we opened the door andwalked right in on them, as they sat around the table-twelve orfifteen of them, three of us. When they saw us they stopped talkingand just stared. We walked right across the room, uncoupled themachine-gun; Comrade Zalkind picked up one part, I the other, we putthem on our shoulders and walked out-and not a single man said aword!""Do you know how the Winter Palace was captured?" asked a third man,a sailor. "Along about eleven o'clock we found out there weren't anymore _yunkers_ on the Neva side. So we broke in the doors andfiltered up the different stairways one by one, or in littlebunches. When we got to the top of the stairs the _yunkers_ held usup and took away our guns. Still our fellows kept coming up, littleby little, until we had a majority. Then we turned around and tookaway the _yunkers'_ guns...."Just then the commandant entered-a merry-looking youngnon-commissioned officer with his arm in a sling, and deep circlesof sleeplessness under his eyes. His eye fell first on the prisoner,who at once began to explain."Oh, yes," interrupted the other. "You were one of the committee whorefused to surrender the Staff Wednesday afternoon. However, wedon't want you, citizen. Apologies-" He opened the door and wavedhis arm for Count Tolstoy to leave. Several of the others,especially the Red Guards, grumbled protests, and the sailorremarked triumphantly, _"Vot!_ There! Didn't I say so?"Two soldiers now engaged his attention. They had been elected acommittee of the fortress garrison to protest. The prisoners, theysaid, were getting the same food as the guards, when there wasn'teven enough to keep a man from being hungry. "Why should thecounter-revolutionists be treated so well?""We are revolutionists, comrades, not bandits," answered thecommandant. He turned to us. We explained that rumours were goingabout that the _yunkers_ were being tortured, and the lives of theMinisters threatened. Could we perhaps see the prisoners, so as tobe able to prove to the world-?""No," said the young soldier, irritably. "I am not going to disturbthe prisoners again. I have just been compelled to wake them up-theywere sure we were going to massacre them.... Most of the _yunkers_have been released anyway, and the rest will go out to-morrow." Heturned abruptly away."Could we talk to the Duma commission, then?"The Commandant, who was pouring himself a glass of tea, nodded."They are still out in the hall," he said carelessly.Indeed they stood there just outside the door, in the feeble lightof an oil lamp, grouped around the Mayor and talking excitedly."Mr. Mayor," I said, "we are American correspondents. Will youplease tell us officially the result of your investigations?"He turned to us his face of venerable dignity."There is no truth in the reports," he said slowly. "Except for theincidents which occurred as the Ministers were being brought here,they have been treated with every consideration. As for the_yunkers,_ not one has received the slightest injury...."Up the Nevsky, in the empty after-midnight gloom, an interminablecolumn of soldiers shuffled in silence-to battle with Kerensky. Indim back streets automobiles without lights flitted to and fro, andthere was furtive activity in Fontanka 6, headquarters of thePeasants' Soviet, in a certain apartment of a huge building on theNevsky, and in the _Injinierny Zamok_ (School of Engineers); theDuma was illuminated....In Smolny Institute the Military Revolutionary Committee flashedbaleful fire, pounding like an over-loaded dynamo....                              Chapter VII                          The Revolutionary FrontSATURDAY, November 10th....Citizens!The Military Revolutionary Committee declares that it will nottolerate any violation of revolutionary order....Theft, brigandage, assaults and attempts at massacre will beseverely punished....Following the example of the Paris Commune, the Committee willdestroy without mercy any looter or instigator of disorder....Quiet lay the city. Not a hold-up, not a robbery, not even a drunkenfight. By night armed patrols went through the silent streets, andon the corners soldiers and Red Guards squatted around little fires,laughing and singing. In the daytime great crowds gathered on thesidewalks listening to interminable hot debates between students andsoldiers, business men and workmen.Citizens stopped each other on the street."The Cossacks are coming?""No....""What's the latest?""I don't know anything. Where's Kerensky?""They say only eight versts from Petrograd.... Is it true that theBolsheviki have fled to the battleship _Avrora?"_"They say so...."Only the walls screamed, and the few newspapers; denunciation,appeal, decree....An enormous poster carried the hysterical manifesto of the ExecutiveCommittee of the Peasant' Soviets:....They (the Bolsheviki) dare to say that they are supported by theSoviets of Peasants' Deputies, and that they are speaking on behalfof the Soviets of Peasants' Deputies....Let all working-class Russia know that this is a LIE, AND THAT ALLTHE WORKING PEASANTS-in the person of-the EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THEALL-RUSSIAN SOVIETS OF PEASANTS' DEPUTIES-refutes with indignationall participation of the organised peasantry in this criminalviolation of the will of the working-classes....From the Soldier Section of the Socialist Revolutionary party:The insane attempt of the Bolsheviki is on the eve of collapse. Thegarrison is divided.... The Ministries are on strike and bread isgetting scarcer. All factions except the few Bolsheviki have leftthe Congress. The Bolsheviki are alone....We call upon all sane elements to group themselves around theCommittee for Salvation of Country and Revolution, and to preparethemselves seriously to be ready at the first call of the CentralCommittee....In a hand-bill the Council of the Republic recited its wrongs:Ceding to the force of bayonets, the Council of the Republic hasbeen obliged to separate, and temporarily to interrupt its meetings.The usurpers, with the words "Liberty and Socialism" on their lips,have set up a rule of arbitrary violence. They have arrested themembers of the Provisional Government, closed the newspapers, seizedthe printing-shops....This power must be considered the enemy of thepeople and the Revolution; it is necessary to do battle with it, andto pull it down....The Council of the Republic, until the resumption of its labours,invites the citizens of the Russian Republic to group themselvesaround the....local Committees for Salvation of Country andRevolution, which are organising the overthrow of the Bolsheviki andthe creation of a Government capable of leading the country to theConstituent Assembly._Dielo Naroda_said:A revolution is a rising of all the people.... But here what have we?Nothing but a handful of poor fools deceived by Lenin and Trotzky....Their decrees and their appeals will simply add to the museum ofhistorical curiosities....And _Narodnoye Slovo_(People'sWord-PopulistSocialist):"Workers' and Peasants' Government?" That is only a pipedream;nobody, either in Russia or in the countries of our Allies, willrecognise this "Government"-or even in the enemy countries....The bourgeois press had temporarily disappeared...._Pravada_ had anaccount of the first meeting of the new _Tsay-ee-kah,_ now theparliament of the Russian Soviet Republic. Miliutin, Commissar ofAgriculture, remarked that the Peasants' Executive Committee hadcalled an All-Russian Peasant Congress for December 13th."But we cannot wait," he said. "We must have the backing of thepeasants. I propose that _we_ call the Congress of Peasants, and doit immediately...." The Left Socialist Revolutionaries agreed. AnAppeal to the Peasants of Russia was hastily drafted, and acommittee of five elected to carry out the project.The question of detailed plans for distributing the land, and thequestion of Workers' Control of Industry, were postponed until theexperts working on them should submit a report.Three decrees (See App. VII, Sect. 1) were read and approved: first,Lenin's "General Rules For the Press," ordering the suppression ofall newspapers inciting to resistance and disobedience to the newGovernment, inciting to criminal acts, or deliberately pervertingthe news; the Decree of Moratorium for House-rents; and the DecreeEstablishing a Workers' Militia. Also orders, one giving theMunicipal Duma power to requisition empty apartments and houses, theother directing the unloading of freight cars in the railroadterminals, to hasten the distribution of necessities and to free thebadly-needed rolling-stock....Two hours later the Executive Committee of the Peasants' Soviets wassending broadcast over Russia the following telegram:The arbitrary organisation of the Bolsheviki, which is called"Bureau of Organisation for the National Congress of Peasants,"isinviting all the Peasants' Soviets to send delegates to the Congressat Petrograd....The Executive Committee of the Soviets of Peasants' Deputiesdeclares that it considers, now as well as before, that it would bedangerous to take away from the provinces at this moment the forcesnecessary to prepare for elections to the Constituent Assembly,which is the only salvation of the working-class and the country. Weconfirm the date of the Congress of Peasants, _December 13th._At the Duma all was excitement, officers coming and going, the Mayorin conference with the leaders of the Committee for Salvation. ACouncillor ran in with a copy of Kerensky's proclamation, dropped byhundreds from an aeroplane low flying down the Nevsky, whichthreatened terrible vengeance on all who did not submit, and orderedsoldiers to lay down their arms and assemble immediately in MarsField.The Minister-President had taken Tsarskoye Selo, we were told, andwas already in the Petrograd campagna, five miles away. He wouldenter the city to-morrow-in a few hours. The Soviet troops incontact with his Cossacks were said to be going over to theProvisional Government. Tchernov was somewhere in between, trying toorganise the "neutral" troops into a force to halt the civil war.In the city the garrison regiments were leaving the Bolsheviki, theysaid. Smolny was already abandoned.... All the Governmental machineryhad stopped functioning. The employees of the State Bank had refusedto work under Commissars from Smolny, refused to pay out money tothem. All the private banks were closed. The Ministries were onstrike. Even now a committee from the Duma was making the rounds ofbusiness houses, collecting a fund to pay the salaries of thestrikers....Trotzky had gone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ordered theclerks to translate the Decree on Peace into foreign languages; sixhundred functionaries had hurled their resignations in his face....Shliapnikov, Commissar of Labour, had commanded all the employees ofhis Ministry to return to their places within twenty-four hours, orlose their places and their pension-rights; only the door-servantshad responded.... Some of the branches of the Special Food SupplyCommittee had suspended work rather than submit to the Bolsheviki....In spite of lavish promises of high wages and better conditions, theoperators at the Telephone Exchange would not connect Sovietheadquarters....The Socialist Revolutionary Party had voted to expel all members whohad remained in the Congress of Soviets, and all who were takingpart in the insurrection....News from the provinces. Moghilev had declared against theBolsheviki. At Kiev the Cossacks had overthrown the Soviets andarrested all the insurrectionary leaders. The Soviet and garrison ofLuga, thirty thousand strong, affirmed its loyalty to theProvisional Government, and appealed to all Russia to rally aroundit. Kaledin had dispersed all Soviets and Unions in the Don Basin,and his forces were moving north....Said a representative of the Railway Workers: "Yesterday we sent atelegram all over Russia demanding that war between the politicalparties cease at once, and insisting on the formation of a coalitionSocialist Government. Otherwise we shall call a strike to-morrownight.... In the morning there will be a meeting of all factions toconsider the question. The Bolsheviki seem anxious for anagreement....""If they last that long!" laughed the City Engineer, a stout, ruddyman....As we came up to Smolny-not abandoned, but busier than ever, throngsof workers and soldiers running in and out, and doubled guardseverywhere-we met the reporters for the bourgeois and "moderate"Socialist papers."Threw us out!" cried one, from _Volia Naroda._ "Bonch-Bruevitchcame down to the Press Bureau and told us to leave! Said we werespies!" They all began to talk at once: "Insult! Outrage! Freedom ofthe press!"In the lobby were great tables heaped with stacks of appeals,proclamations and orders of the Military Revolutionary Committee.Workmen and soldiers staggered past, carrying them to waitingautomobiles.One began:TO THE PILLORY!In this tragic moment through which the Russian masses are living,the Mensheviki and their followers and the Right SocialistRevolutionaries have betrayed the working-class. They have enlistedon the side of Kornilov, Kerensky and Savinkov....They are printing orders of the traitor Kerensky and creating apanic in the city, spreading the most ridiculous rumours of mythicalvictories by that renegade....Citizens! Don't believe these false rumours. No power can defeat thePeople's Revolution.... Premier Kerensky and his followers awaitspeedy and well-deserved punishment....We are putting them in the Pillory. We are abandoning them to theenmity of all workers, soldiers, sailors and peasants, on whom theyare trying to rivet the ancient chains. They will never be able towash from their bodies the stain of the people's hatred and contempt.Shame and curses to the traitors of the People!...The Military Revolutionary Committee had moved into larger quarters,room 17 on the top floor. Red Guards were at the door. Inside, thenarrow space in front of the railing was crowded with well-dressedpersons, outwardly respectful but inwardly full of murder-bourgeoiswho wanted permits for their automobiles, or passports to leave thecity, among them many foreigners.... Bill Shatov and Peters were onduty. They suspended all other business to read us the latestbulletins.The One Hundred Seventy-ninth Reserve Regiment offers its unanimoussupport. Five thousand stevedores at the Putilov wharves greet thenew Government. Central Committee of the Trade Unions-enthusiasticsupport. The garrison and squadron at Reval elect MilitaryRevolutionary Committees to cooperate, and despatch troops. MilitaryRevolutionary Committees control in Pskov and Minsk. Greetings fromthe Soviets of Tsaritzin, Rovensky-on-Don, Tchernogorsk,Sevastopol.... The Finland Division, the new Committees of the Fifthand Twelfth Armies, offer allegiance....From Moscow the news is uncertain. Troops of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee occupy the strategic points of the city; twocompanies on duty in the Kremlin have gone over to the Soviets, butthe Arsenal is in the hands of Colonel Diabtsev and his _yunkers._The Revolutionary Committee demanded arms for the workers, andRiabtsev parleyed with them until this morning, when suddenly hesent an ultimatum to the Committee, ordering Soviet troops tosurrender and the Committee to disband. Fighting has begun....In Petrograd the Staff submitted to Smolny's Commissars at once. The_Tsentroflot,_ refusing, was stormed by Dybenko and a company ofCronstadt sailors, and a new _Tsentroflot_ set up, supported by theBaltic and the Black Sea battleships....But beneath all the breezy assurance there was a chill premonition,a feeling of uneasiness in the air. Kerensky's Cossacks were comingfast; they had artillery. Skripnik, Secretary of the Factory-ShopCommittees, his face drawn and yellow, assured me that there was awhole army corps of them, but he added, fiercely, "They'll nevertake us alive!" Petrovsky laughed weariedly, "To-morrow maybe we'llget a sleep-a long one...." Lozovsky, with his emaciated, red-beardedface, said, "What chance have we? All alone.... A mob against trainedsoldiers!"South and south-west the Soviets had fled before Kerensky, and thegarrisons of Gatchina, Pavlovsk, Tsarskoye Selo were divided-halfvoting to remain neutral, the rest, without officers, falling backon the capital in the wildest disorder.In the halls they were pasting up bulletins:FROM KRASNOYE SELO, NOVEMBER 10TH, 8 A.M._To be communicated to all Commanders of Staffs, Commanders inChief, Commanders, everywhere and to all, all, all._The ex-Minister Kerensky has sent a deliberately false telegram toevery one everywhere to the effect that the troops of revolutionaryPetrograd have voluntarily surrendered their arms and joined thearmies of the former Government, the Government of Treason, and thatthe soldiers have been ordered by the Military RevolutionaryCommittee to retreat. The troops of a free people do not retreat nordo they surrender.Our troops have left Gatchina in order to avoid bloodshed betweenthemselves and their mistaken brother-Cossacks, and in order to takea more convenient position, which is at present so strong that ifKerensky and his companions in arms should even increase theirforces ten times, still there would be no cause for anxiety. Thespirit of our troops is excellent.In Petrograd all is quiet._Chief of the Defence of Petrograd and the Petrograd District,_Lieutenant-Colonel Muraviov.As we left the Military Revolutionary Committee Antonov entered, apaper in his hand, looking like a corpse."Send this," said he.TO ALL DISTRICT SOVIETS OF WORKERS' DEPUTIES AND FACTORYSHOPCOMMITTEESThe Kornilovist bands of Kerensky are threatening the approaches tothe capital. All the necessary orders have been given to crushmercilessly the counter-revolutionary attempt against the people andits conquests.The Army and the Red Guard of the Revolution are in need of theimmediate support of the workers.WE ORDER THE WARD SOVIETS AND FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES:1. To move out the greatest possible number of workers for thedigging of trenches, the erection of barricades and reinforcing ofwire entanglements.2. Wherever it shall be necessary for this purpose to stop work atthe factories this shall be done immediately.3. All common and barbed wire available must be assembled, and alsoall implements for the digging of trenches and the erection ofbarricades.4. All available arms must be taken.5. THE STRICTEST DISCIPLINE IS TO BE OBSERVED, AND EVERY ONE MUST BEREADY TO SUPPORT THE ARMY OF THE REVOLUTION BY ALL MEANS._Chairman of the Petrograd Soviet of Worker's and Soldiers'Deputies,_People's Commissar LEON TROTZKY._Chairman of the Military Revolutionary Committee,_Commander in Chief PODVOISKY.As we came out into the dark and gloomy day all around the greyhorizon factory whistles were blowing, a hoarse and nervous sound,full of foreboding. By tens of thousands the working-people pouredout, men and women; by tens of thousands the humming slums belchedout their dun and miserable hordes. Red Petrograd was in danger!Cossacks! South and southwest they poured through the shabby streetstoward the Moskovsky Gate, men, women and children, with rifles,picks, spades, rolls of wire, cartridge-belts over their workingclothes.... Such an immense, spontaneous outpouring of a city neverwas seen! They rolled along torrent-like, companies of soldiersborne with them, guns, motor-trucks, wagons-the revolutionaryproletariat defending with its breast the capital of the Workers'and Peasants' Republic!Before the door of Smolny was an automobile. A slight man with thickglasses magnifying his red-rimmed eyes, his speech a painful effort,stood leaning against a mud-guard with his hands in the pockets of ashabby raglan. A great bearded sailor, with the clear eyes of youth,prowled restlessly about, absently toying with an enormousblue-steel revolver, which never left his hand. These were Antonovand Dybenko.Some soldiers were trying to fasten two military bicycles on therunning-board. The chauffeur violently protested; the enamel wouldget scratched, he said. True, he was a Bolshevik, and the automobilewas commandeered from a bourgeois; true, the bicycles were for theuse of orderlies. But the chauffeur's professional pride wasrevolted.... So the bicycles were abandoned....The People's Commissars for War and Marine were going to inspect therevolutionary front-wherever that was. Could we go with them?Certainly not. The automobile only held five-the two Commissars, twoorderlies and the chauffeur. However, a Russian acquaintance ofmine, whom I will call Trusishka, calmly got in and sat down, norcould any argument dislodge him....I see no reason to doubt Trusishka's story of the journey. As theywent down the Suvorovsky Prospect some one mentioned food. Theymight be out three or four days, in a country indifferently wellprovisioned. They stopped the car. Money? The Commissar of Warlooked through his pockets-he hadn't a kopek. The Commissar ofMarine was broke. So was the chauffeur. Trusishka bought theprovisions....Just as they turned into the Nevsky a tire blew out."What shall we do?" asked Antonov."Commandeer another machine!" suggested Dybenko, waving hisrevolver. Antonov stood in the middle of the street and signalled apassing machine, driven by a soldier."I want that machine," said Antonov."You won't get it," responded the soldier."Do you know who I am?" Antonov produced a paper upon which waswritten that he had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of all thearmies of the Russian Republic, and that every one should obey himwithout question."I don't care if you're the devil himself," said the soldier, hotly."This machine belongs to the First Machine-Gun Regiment, and we'recarrying ammunition in it, and you can't have it...."The difficulty, however, was solved by the appearance of an oldbattered taxi-cab, flying the Italian flag. (In time of troubleprivate cars were registered in the name of foreign consulates, soas to be safe from requisition.) From the interior of this wasdislodged a fat citizen in an expensive fur coat, and the partycontinued on its way.Arrived at Narvskaya Zastava, about ten miles out, Antonov calledfor the commandant of the Red Guard. He was led to the edge of thetown, where some few hundred workmen had dug trenches and werewaiting for the Cossacks."Everything all right here, comrade?" asked Antonov."Everything perfect, comrade," answered the commandant."The troops are in excellent spirits.... Only one thing-we have noammunition....""In Smolny there are two billion rounds," Antonov told him. "I willgive you an order." He felt in his pockets. "Has any one a piece ofpaper?"Dybenko had none-nor the couriers. Trusishka had to offer hisnote-book...."Devil! I have no pencil!" cried Antonov. "Who's got a pencil?"Needless to say, Trusishka had the only pencil in the crowd....We who were left behind made for the Tsarskoye Selo station. Up theNevsky, as we passed, Red Guards were marching, all armed, some withbayonets and some without. The early twilight of winter was falling.Heads up they tramped in the chill mud, irregular lines of four,without music, without drums. A red flag crudely lettered in gold,"Peace! Land!" floated over them. They were very young. Theexpression on their faces was that of who know they are going todie.... Half-fearful, half-contemptuous, the crowds on the sidewalkwatched them pass, in hateful silence....[Graphic page-184  Pass to the Northern Front]This pass was issued upon the recommendation of Trotzky three daysafter the Bolshevik Revolution. It gives me the right of free travelto the Northern front-and an added note on the back extends thepermission to all fronts. It will be noticed that the speaks of the_Petersburg_, instead of the _Petrograd_ Soviet; it was the fashionamong thorough-going internationalists to abolish all names whichsmacked of "patriotism"; but at the same time, it would not do torestore the "Saint."...                      (Translation)Executive CommitteePetrograd Soviet ofWorkers' and Soldiers'     Deputies  Military Section28th October, 1917    No. 1435                      CERTIFICATEThe present certificate is given to the representative of theAmerican Social Democracy, the internationalist comrade JOHN REED.The Military Revolutionary Committee of the Petersburg Soviet ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies gives him the right of free travelthrough the entire Northern front, for the purpose of reporting toour American comrades-internationalists concerning events in Russia.                              For the President                              For the SecretaryAt the railroad station nobody knew just where Kerensky was, orwhere the front lay. Trains went no further, however, thanTsarskoye....Our car was full of commuters and country people going home, ladenwith bundles and evening papers. The talk was all of the Bolshevikrising. Outside of that, however, one would never have realised thatcivil war was rending mighty Russia in two, and that the train washeaded into the zone of battle. Through the window we could see, inthe swiftly-deepening darkness, masses of soldiers going along themuddy road toward the city, flinging out their arms in argument. Afreight-train, swarming with troops and lit up by huge bonfires, washalted on a siding. That was all. Back along the flat horizon theglow of the city's lights faded down the night. A street-car crawleddistantly along a far-flung suburb....Tsarskoye Selo-station was quiet, but knots of soldiers stood hereand there talking in low tones and looking uneasily down the emptytrack in the direction of Gatchina. I asked some of them which sidethey were on. "Well," said one, "we don't exactly know the rights ofthe matter.... There is no doubt that Kerensky is a provocator, but wedo not consider it right for Russian men to be shooting Russian men."In the station commandant's office was a big, jovial, bearded commonsoldier, wearing the red arm-band of a regimental committee. Ourcredentials from Smolny commanded immediate respect. He was plainlyfor the Soviets, but bewildered."The Red Guards were here two hours ago, but they went away again. ACommissar came this morning, but he returned to Petrograd when theCossacks arrived.""The Cossacks are here then?"He nodded, gloomily. "There has been a battle. The Cossacks cameearly in the morning. They captured two or three hundred of our men,and killed about twenty-five.""Where are the Cossacks?""Well, they didn't get this far. I don't know just where they are.Off that way...." He waved his arm vaguely westward.We had dinner-an excellent dinner, better and cheaper than could begot in Petrograd-in the station restaurant. Nearby sat a Frenchofficer who had just come on foot from Gatchina. All was quietthere, he said. Kerensky held the town. "Ah, these Russians," hewent on, "they are original! What a civil war! Everything except thefighting!"We sallied out into the town. Just at the door of the station stoodtwo soldiers with rifles and bayonets fixed. They were surrounded byabout a hundred business men, Government officials and students, whoattacked them with passionate argument and epithet. The soldierswere uncomfortable and hurt, like children unjustly scolded.A tall young man with a supercilious expression, dressed in theuniform of a student, was leading the attack."You realise, I presume," he said insolently, "that by taking uparms against your brothers you are making your-selves the tools ofmurderers and traitors?""Now brother,"answered the soldier earnestly, "you don't understand.There are two classes, don't you see, the proletariat and thebourgeoisie. We--""Oh, I know that silly talk!" broke in the student rudely. "A bunchof ignorant peasants like you hear somebody bawling a fewcatch-words. You don't understand what they mean. You just echo themlike a lot of parrots." The crowd laughed. "I'm a Marxian student.And I tell you that this isn't Socialism you are fighting for. It'sjust plain pro-German anarchy!""Oh, yes, I know," answered the soldier, with sweat dripping fromhis brow. "You are an educated man, that is easy to see, and I amonly a simple man. But it seems to me--""I suppose," interrupted the other contemptuously, "that you believeLenin is a real friend of the proletariat?""Yes, I do," answered the soldier, suffering."Well, my friend, do you know that Lenin was sent through Germany ina closed car? Do you know that Lenin took money from the Germans?""Well, I don't know much about that," answered the soldierstubbornly, "but it seems to me that what he says is what I want tohear, and all the simple men like me. Now there are two classes, thebourgeoisie and the proletariat--""You are a fool! Why, my friend, I spent two years in Schlüsselburgfor revolutionary activity, when you were still shooting downrevolutionists and singing 'God Save the Tsar!' My name is VasiliGeorgevitch Panyin. Didn't you ever hear of me?""I'm sorry to say I never did," answered the soldier with humility."But then, I am not an educated man. You are probably a great hero.""I am," said the student with conviction. "And I am opposed to theBolsheviki, who are destroying our Russia, our free Revolution. Nowhow do you account for that?"The soldier scratched his head. "I can't account for it at all," hesaid, grimacing with the pain of his intellectual processes. "To meit seems perfectly simple-but then, I'm not well educated. It seemslike there are only two classes, the proletariat and thebourgeoisie--""There you go again with your silly formula!" cried the student."--only two classes," went on the soldier, doggedly.ldquo;And whoever isn't on one side is on the other..."We wandered on up the street, where the lights were few and farbetween, and where people rarely passed. A threatening silence hungover the place-as of a sort of purgatory between heaven and hell, apolitical No Man's Land. Only the barber shops were all brilliantlylighted and crowded, and a line formed at the doors of the publicbath; for it was Saturday night, when all Russia bathes and perfumesitself. I haven't the slightest doubt that Soviet troops andCossacks mingled in the places where these ceremonies were performed.The nearer we came to the Imperial Park, the more deserted were thestreets. A frightened priest pointed out the headquarters of theSoviet, and hurried on. It was in the wing of one of the Grand Ducalpalaces, fronting the Park. The windows were dark, the door locked.A soldier, lounging about with his hands in the top of his trousers,looked us up and down with gloomy suspicion. "The Soviet went awaytwo days ago," said he. "Where?" A shrug. _"Nie znayu._ I don'tknow."A little further along was a large building, brightly illuminated.From within came a sound of hammering. While we were hesitating, asoldier and a sailor came down the street, hand in hand. I showedthem my pass from Smolny. "Are you for the Soviets?" I asked. Theydid not answer, but looked at each other in a frightened way."What is going on in there?" asked the sailor, pointing to thebuilding."I don't know."Timidly the soldier put out his hand and opened the door a crack.Inside a great hall hung with bunting and evergreens, rows ofchairs, a stage being built.A stout woman with a hammer in her hand and her mouth full of tackscame out. "What do you want?" she asked."Is there a performance to-night?" said the sailor, nervously."There will be private theatricals Sunday night," she answeredseverely. "Go away."We tried to engage the soldier and sailor in conversation, but theyseemed frightened and unhappy, and drew off into the darkness.We strolled toward the Imperial Palaces, along the edge of the vast,dark gardens, their fantastic pavilions and ornamental bridgeslooming uncertainly in the night, and soft water splashing from thefountains. At one place, where a ridiculous iron swan spatunceasingly from an artificial grotto, we were suddenly aware ofobservation, and looked up to encounter the sullen, suspicious gazeof half a dozen gigantic armed soldiers, who stared moodily downfrom a grassy terrace. I climbed up to them. "Who are you?" I asked."We are the guard," answered one. They all looked very depressed, asundoubtedly they were, from weeks and weeks of all-day all-nightargument and debate."Are you Kerensky's troops, or the Soviets'?"There was silence for a moment, as they looked uneasily at eachother. Then, "We are neutral," said he.We went on through the arch of the huge Ekaterina Palace, into thePalace enclosure itself, asking for headquarters. A sentry outside adoor in a curving white wing of the Palace said that the commandantwas inside.In a graceful, white, Georgian room, divided into unequal parts by atwo-sided fire-place, a group of officers stood anxiously talking.They were pale and distracted, and evidently hadn't slept. To one,an oldish man with a white beard, his uniform studded withdecorations, who was pointed out as the Colonel, we showed ourBolshevik papers.He seemed surprised. "How did you get here without being killed?" heasked politely. "It is very dangerous in the streets just now.Political passion is running very high in Tsarskoye Selo. There wasa battle this morning, and there will be another to-morrow morning.Kerensky is to enter the town at eight o'clock.""Where are the Cossacks?""About a mile over that way." He waved his arm."And you will defend the city against them?""Oh dear no." He smiled. "We are holding the city for Kerensky." Ourhearts sank, for our passes stated that we were revolutionary to thecore. The Colonel cleared his throat. "About those passes of yours,"he went on. "Your lives will be in danger if you are captured.Therefore, if you want to see the battle, I will give you an orderfor rooms in the officers' hotel, and if you will come back here atseven o'clock in the morning, I will give you new passes.""So you are for Kerensky?" we said."Well, not exactly _for_ Kerensky." The Colonel hesitated. "You see,most of the soldiers in the garrison are Bolsheviki, and to-day,after the battle, they all went away in the direction of Petrograd,taking the artillery with them. You might say that none of the_soldiers_ are for Kerensky; but some of them just don't want tofight at all. The _officers_ have almost all gone over to Kerensky'sforces, or simply gone away. We are-ahem-in a most difficultposition, as you see...."We did not believe that there would be any battle.... The Colonelcourteously sent his orderly to escort us to the railroad station.He was from the South, born of French immigrant parents inBessarabia. "Ah," he kept saying, "it is not the danger or thehardships I mind, but being so long, three years, away from mymother...."Looking out of the window of the train as we sped through the colddark toward Petrograd, I caught glimpses of clumps of soldiersgesticulating in the light of fires, and of clusters of armouredcars halted together at cross-roads, the chauffeurs hanging out ofthe turrets and shouting to each other....All the troubled night over the bleakflats leaderless bands ofsoldiers and Red Guards wandered, clashing and confused, and theCommissars of the Military Revolutionary Committee hurried from onegroup to another, trying to organise a defence....Back in town excited throngs were moving in tides up and down theNevsky. Something was in the air. From the Warsaw Railway stationcould be heard far-off cannonade. In the _yunker_ schools there wasfeverish activity. Duma members went from barracks to barracks,arguing and pleading, narrating fearful stories of Bolshevikviolence-massacre of the _yunkers_ in the Winter Palace, rape of thewomen soldiers, the shooting of the girl before the Duma, the murderof Prince Tumanov.... In the Alexander Hall of the Duma building theCommittee for Salvation was in special session; Commissars came andwent, running.... All the journalists expelled from Smolny were there,in high spirits. They did not believe our report of conditions inTsarskoye. Why, everybody knew that Tsarskoye was in Kerensky'shands, and that the Cossacks were now at Pulkovo. A committee wasbeing elected to meet Kerensky at the railway station in themorning....One confided to me, in strictest secrecy, that thecounter-revolution would begin at midnight. He showed me twoproclamations, one signed by Gotz and Polkovnikov, ordering the_yunker_ schools, soldier convalescents in the hospitals, and theKnights of St. George to mobilise on a war footing and wait fororders from the Committee for Salvation; the other from theCommittee for Salvation itself, which read as follows:To the Population of Petrograd!Comrades, workers, soldiers and citizens of revolutionary Petrograd!  nary Petrograd!  |          |The Bolsheviki, while appealing for peace at the front, are incitingto civil war in the rear.Do not dig their provocatory appeals!Do not dig trenches!Down with the traitorous barricades!Lay down your arms!Soldiers, return to your barracks!The war begun in Petrograd-is the death of the Revolution!In the name of liberty, land, and peace, unite around the Committeefor Salvation of Country and Revolution!As we left the Duma a company of Red Guards, stern-faced anddesperate, came marching down the dark, deserted street with a dozenprisoners-members of the local branch of the Council of Cossacks,caught red-handed plotting counter-revolution in their headquarters....A soldier, accompanied by a small boy with a pail of paste, wassticking up great flaring notices:By virtue of the present, the city of Petrograd and its suburbs aredeclared in a state of siege. All assemblies or meetings in thestreets, and generally in the open air, are forbidden until furtherorders.N. PODVOISKY, President of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee.As we went home the air was full of confused sound-automobile horns,shouts, distant shots. The city stirred uneasily, wakeful.In the small hours of the morning a company of _yunkers,_ disguisedas soldiers of the Semionovsky Regiment, presented themselves at theTelephone Exchange just before the hour of changing guard. They hadthe Bolshevik password, and took charge without arousing suspicion.A few minutes later Antonov appeared, making a round of inspection.Him they captured and locked in a small room. When the relief cameit was met by a blast of rifle-fire, several being killed.Counter-revolution had begun...                              Chapter VIII                            Counter-RevolutionNEXT morning, Sunday the 11th, the Cossacks entered Tsarskoye Selo,Kerensky (See App. VIII, Sect. 1) himself riding a white horse andall the church-bells clamouring. From the top of a little hilloutside the town could be seen the golden spires and many-colouredcupolas, the sprawling grey immensity of the capital spread alongthe dreary plain, and beyond, the steely Gulf of Finland.There was no battle. But Kerensky made a fatal blunder. At seven inthe morning he sent word to the Second Tsarskoye Selo Rifles to laydown their arms. The soldiers replied that they would remainneutral, but would not disarm. Kerensky gave them ten minutes inwhich to obey. This angered the soldiers; for eight months they hadbeen governing themselves by committee, and this smacked of the oldrégime.... A few minutes later Cossack artillery opened fire on thebarracks, killing eight men. From that moment there were no more"neutral" soldiers in Tsarskoye....Petrograd woke to bursts of rifle-fire, and the tramping thunder ofmen marching. Under the high dark sky a cold wind smelt of snow. Atdawn the Military Hotel and the Telegraph Agency had been taken bylarge forces of _yunkers,_ and bloodily recaptured. The TelephoneStation was besieged by sailors, who lay behind barricades ofbarrels, boxes and tin sheets in the middle of the Morskaya, orsheltered themselves at the corner of the Gorokhovaya and of St.Isaac's Square, shooting at anything that moved. Occasionally anautomobile passed in and out, flying the Red Cross flag. The sailorslet it pass....Albert Rhys Williams was in the Telephone Exchange. He went out withthe Red Cross automobile, which was ostensibly full of wounded.After circulating about the city, the car went by devious ways tothe Mikhailovsky _yunker_ school, headquarters of thecounter-revolution. A French officer, in the court-yard, seemed tobe in command.... By this means ammunition and supplies were conveyedto the Telephone Exchange. Scores of these pretended ambulancesacted as couriers and ammunition trains for the _yunkers._Five or six armoured cars, belonging to the disbanded BritishArmoured Car Division, were in their hands. As Louise Bryant wasgoing along St. Isaac's Square one came rolling up from theAdmiralty, on its way to the Telephone Exchange. At the corner ofthe Gogolia, right in front of her, the engine stalled. Some sailorsambushed behind wood-piles began shooting. The machine-gun in theturret of the thing slewed around and spat a hail of bulletsindiscriminately into the wood-piles and the crowd. In the archwaywhere Miss Bryant stood seven people were shot dead, among them twolittle boys. Suddenly, with a shout, the sailors leaped up andrushed into the flaming open; closing around the monster, theythrust their bayonets into the loop-holes, again and again, yelling...The chauffeur pretended to be wounded, and they let him go free-torun to the Duma and swell the tale of Bolshevik atrocities....Amongthe dead was a British Officer....Later the newspapers told of another French officer, captured in a_yunker_ armoured car and sent to Peter-Paul. The French Embassypromptly denied this, but one of the City Councillors told me thathe himself had procured the officer's release from prison....Whatever the official attitude of the Allied Embassies, individualFrench and British officers were active these days, even to theextent of giving advice at executive sessions of the Committee forSalvation.All day long in every quarter of the city there were skirmishesbetween _yunkers_ and Red Guards, battles between armoured cars....Volleys, single shots and the shrill chatter of machine-guns couldbe heard, far and near. The iron shutters of the shops were drawn,but business still went on. Even the moving-picture shows, alloutside lights dark, played to crowded houses. The street-cars ran.The telephones were all working; when you called Central, shootingcould be plainly heard over the wire.... Smolny was cut off, but theDuma and the Committee for Salvation were in constant communicationwith all the _yunker_ schools and with Kerensky at Tsarskoye.At seven in the morning the Vladimir _yunker_ school was visited bya patrol of soldiers, sailors and Red Guards, who gave the _yunkers_twenty minutes to lay down their arms. The ultimatum was rejected.An hour later the _yunkers_ got ready to march, but were driven backby a violent fusillade from the corner of the Grebetskaya and theBolshoy Prospekt. Soviet troops surrounded the building and openedfire, two armoured cars cruising back and forth with machine gunsraking it. The _yunkers_ telephoned for help. The Cossacks repliedthat they dare not come, because a large body of sailors with twocannon commanded their barracks. The Pavlovsk school was surrounded.Most of the Mikhailov _yunkers_ were fighting in the streets....At half-past eleven three field-pieces arrived. Another demand tosurrender was met by the _yunkers_ shooting down two of the Sovietdelegates under the white flag. Now began a real bombardment. Greatholes were torn in the walls of the school. The _yunkers_ defendedthemselves desperately; shouting waves of Red Guards, assaulting,crumpled under the withering blast.... Kerensky telephoned fromTsarskoye to refuse all parley with the Military RevolutionaryCommittee.Frenzied by defeat and their heaps of dead, the Soviet troops openeda tornado of steel and flame against the battered building. Theirown officers could not stop the terrible bombardment. A Commissarfrom Smolny named Kirilov tried to halt it; he was threatened withlynching. The Red Guards' blood was up.At half-past two the _yunkers_ hoisted a white flag; they wouldsurrender if they were guaranteed protection. This was promised.With a rush and a shout thousands of soldiers and Red Guards pouredthrough windows, doors and holes in the wall. Before it could bestopped five _yunkers_ were beaten and stabbed to death. The rest,about two hundred, were taken to Peter-Paul under escort, in smallgroups so as to avoid notice. On the way a mob set upon one party,killing eight more _yunkers_.... More than a hundred Red Guards andsoldiers had fallen....Two hours later the Duma got a telephone message that the victorswere marching toward the _Injinierny Zamok_-the Engineers' school. Adozen members immediately set out to distribute among them armfulsof the latest proclamation of the Committee for Salvation. Severaldid not come back.... All the other schools surrendered withoutresistance, and the _yunkers_ were sent unharmed to Peter-Paul andCronstadt....The Telephone Exchange held out until afternoon, when a Bolshevikarmoured car appeared, and the sailors stormed the place. Shrieking,the frightened telephone girls ran to and fro; the _yunkers_ torefrom their uniforms all distinguishing marks, and one offeredWilliams _anything_ for the loan of his overcoat, as a disguise...."They will massacre us! They will massacre us!" they cried, for manyof them had given their word at the Winter Palace not to take uparms against the People. Williams offered to mediate if Antonov werereleased. This was immediately done; Antonov and Williams madespeeches to the victorious sailors, inflamed by their many dead-andonce more the _yunkers_ went free.... All but a few, who in theirpanic tried to flee over the roofs, or to hide in the attic, andwere found and hurled into the street.Tired, bloody, triumphant, the sailors and workers swarmed into theswitchboard room, and finding so many pretty girls, fell back in anembarrassed way and fumbled with awkward feet. Not a girl wasinjured, not one insulted. Frightened, they huddled in the corners,and then, finding themselves safe, gave vent to their spite. "Ugh!The dirty, ignorant people! The fools!"... The sailors and Red Guardswere embarrassed. "Brutes! Pigs!" shrilled the girls, indignantlyputting on their coats and hats. Romantic had been their experiencepassing up cartridges and dressing the wounds of their dashing youngdefenders, the _yunkers,_ many of them members of noble families,fighting to restore their beloved Tsar! These were just commonworkmen, peasants, "Dark People."...The Commissar of the Military Revolutionary Committee, littleVishniak, tried to persuade the girls to remain. He was effusivelypolite. "You have been badly treated," he said. "The telephonesystem is controlled by the Municipal Duma. You are paid sixtyrubles a month, and have to work ten hours and more.... From now onall that will be changed. The Government intends to put thetelephones under control of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs.Your wages will be immediately raised to one hundred and fiftyrubles, and your working-hours reduced. As members of theworking-class you should be happy--"Members of the _working-class_ indeed! Did he mean to infer thatthere was anything in common between these-these animals-and _us?_Remain? Not if they offered a thousand rubles!... Haughty and spitefulthe girls left the place....The employees of the building, the line-men and labourers-theystayed. But the switch-boards must be operated-the telephone wasvital.... Only half a dozen trained operators were available.Volunteers were called for; a hundred responded, sailors, soldiers,workers. The six girls scurried backward and forward, instructing,helping, scolding.... So, crippled, halting, but _going,_ the wiresslowly began to hum. The first thing was to connect Smolny with thebarracks and the factories; the second, to cut off the Duma and the_yunker_ schools.... Late in the afternoon word of it spread throughthe city, and hundreds of bourgeois called up to scream, "Fools!Devils! How long do you think you will last? Wait till the Cossackscome!"Dusk was already falling. On the almost deserted Nevsky, swept by abitter wind, a crowd had gathered before the Kazan Cathedral,continuing the endless debate; a few workmen, some soldiers and therest shop-keepers, clerks and the like."But Lenin won't get Germany to make peace!" cried one.A violent young soldier replied. "And whose fault is it? Your damnKerensky, dirty bourgeois! To hell with Kerensky! We don't want him!We want Lenin...."Outside the Duma an officer with a white arm-band was tearing downposters from the wall, swearing loudly. One read:To the Population of Petrograd!At this dangerous hour, when the Municipal Duma ought to use everymeans to calm the population, to assure it bread and othernecessities, the Right Socialist Revolutionaries and the Cadets,forgetting their duty, have turned the Duma into acounter-revolutionary meeting, trying to raise part of thepopulation against the rest, so as to facilitate the victory ofKornilov-Kerensky. Instead of doing their duty, the Right SocialistRevolutionaries and the Cadets have transformed the Duma into anarena of political attack upon the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers'and Peasants' Deputies, against the revolutionary Government ofpeace, bread and liberty.Citizens of Petrograd, we, the Bolshevik Municipal Councillorselected by you-we want you to know that the Right SocialistRevolutionaries and the Cadets are engaged in counter-revolutionaryaction, have forgotten their duty, and are leading the population tofamine, to civil war. We, elected by 183,000 votes, consider it ourduty to bring to the attention of our constituents what is going onin the Duma, and declare that we disclaim all responsibility for theterrible but inevitable consequences....Far away still sounded occasional shots, but the city lay quiet,cold, as if exhausted by the violent spasms which had torn it.In the Nicolai Hall the Duma session was coming to an end. Even thetruculent Duma seemed a little stunned. One after another theCommissars reported-capture of the Telephone Exchange,street-fighting, the taking of the Vladimir school.... "The Duma,"said Trupp, "is on the side of the democracy in its struggle againstarbitrary violence; but in any case, whichever side wins, the Dumawill always be against lynchings and torture...."Konovski, Cadet, a tall old man with a cruel face: "When the troopsof the legal Government arrive in Petrograd, they will shoot downthese insurgents, and that will not be lynching!" Protests all overthe hall, even from his own party.Here there was doubt and depression. The counter-revolution wasbeing put down. The Central Committee of the Socialist Revolutionaryparty had voted lack of confidence in its officers; the left wingwas in control; Avksentiev had resigned. signed. A courier reportedthat the Committee of Welcome sent to meet Kerensky at the railwaystation had been arrested. In the streets could be heard the dullrumble of distant cannonading, south and southwest. Still Kerenskydid not come...Only three newspapers were out-_Pravda, Dielo Naroda_ and _NovayaZhizn._ All of them devoted much space to the new "coalition"Government. The Socialist Revolutionary paper demanded a Cabinetwithout either Cadets or Bolsheviki. Gorky was hopeful; Smolny hadmade concessions. A purely Socialist Government was taking shape-allelements except the bourgeoisie. As for _Pravda,_ it sneered:We ridicule these coalitions with political parties whose mostprominent members are petty journalists of doubtful reputation; our"coalition" is that of the proletariat and the revolutionary Armywith the poor peasants...On the walls a vainglorious announcement of the _Vikzhel,_threatening to strike if both sides did not compromise:The conquerors of these riots, the saviours of the wreck of ourcountry, these will be neither the Bolsheviki, nor the Committee forSalvation, nor the troops of Kerensky-but we, the Union ofRailwaymen...Red Guards are incapable of handling a complicated business like therailways; as for the Provisional Government, it has shown itselfincapable of holding the power...We refuse to lend our services to any party which does not act byauthority of ... a Government based on the confidence of all thedemocracy....Smolny thrilled with the boundless vitality of inexhaustiblehumanity in action.In Trade Union headquarters Lozovsky introduced me to a delegate ofthe Railway Workers of the Nicolai line, who said that the men wereholding huge mass-meetings, condemning the action of their leaders."All power to the Soviets!" he cried, pounding on the table."The_oborontsi_ in the Central Committee are playingKo&rgrave;nilov's game. They tried to send a mission to the Stavka,but we arrested them at Minsk.... Our branch has demanded anAll-Russian Convention, and they refuse to call it...."The same situation as in the Soviets, the Army Committees. One afteranother the various democratic organisations, all over Russia, werecracking and changing. The Cooperatives were torn by internalstruggles; the meetings of the Peasants' Executive broke up instormy wrangling; even among the Cossacks there was trouble....On the top floor the Military Revolutionary Committee was in fullblast, striking and slacking not. Men went in, fresh and vigorous;night and day and night and day they threw themselves into theterrible machine; and came out limp, blind with fatigue, hoarse andfilthy, to fall on the floor and sleep.... The Committee for Salvationhad been outlawed. Great piles of new proclamations (See App. VIII,Sect. 2) littered the floor:... The conspirators, who have no support among the garrison or theworking-class, above all counted on the suddenness of their attack.Their plan was discovered in time by Sub-Lieutenant Blagonravov,thanks to the revolutionary vigilance of a soldier of the Red Guard,whose name shall be made public. At the centre of the plot was theCommittee for Salvation. Colonel Polkovnikov was in command of theirforces, and the orders were signed by Gotz, former member of theProvisional Government, allowed at liberty on his word of honour....Bringing these facts to the attention of the Petrograd population,the Military Revolutionary Committee orders the arrest of allconcerned in the conspiracy, who shall be tried before theRevolutionary Tribunal....From Moscow, word that the _yunkers_ and Cossacks had surrounded theKremlin and ordered the Soviet troops to lay down their arms. TheSoviet forces complied, and as they were leaving the Kremlin, wereset upon and shot down. Small forces of Bolsheviki had been drivenfrom the Telephone and Telegraph offices; the _yunkers_ now held thecentre of the city. ... But all around them the Soviet troops weremustering. Street-fighting was slowly gathering way; all attempts atcompromise had failed.... On the side of the Soviet, ten thousandgarrison soldiers and a few Red Guards; on the side of theGovernment, six thousand _yunkers,_ twenty-five hundred Cossacks andtwo thousand White Guards.The Petrograd Soviet was meeting, and next door the new_Tsay-ee-kah,_ acting on the decrees and orders (See App. VIII,Sect. 3) which came down in a steady stream from the Council ofPeople's Commissars in session upstairs; on the Order in Which LawsAre to be Ratified and Published, Establishing an Eight hour Daysfor Workers, and Lunatcharsky's "Basis for a System of PopularEducation." Only a few hundred people were present at the twomeetings, most of them armed. Smolny was almost deserted, except forthe guards, who were busy at the hall windows, setting upmachine-guns to command the flanks of the building.In the _Tsay-ee-kah_ a delegate of the _Vikzhel_ was speaking: "Werefuse to transport the troops of either party.... We have sent acommittee to Kerensky to say that if he continues to march onPetrograd we will break his lines of communication...."He made the usual plea for a conference of all the Socialist partiesto form a new Government....Kameniev answered discreetly. The Bolsheviki would be very glad toattend the conference. The centre of gravity, however, lay not incomposition of such a Government, but in its acceptance of theprogramme of the Congress of Soviets.... The _Tsay-ee-kah_ had deliberated on the declaration made by theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries and the Social DemocratsInternationalists, and had accepted the proposition of proportionalrepresentation at the conference, even including delegates from theArmy Committees and the Peasants' Soviets....In the great hall, Trotzky recounted the events of the day."We offered the Vladimir _yunkers_ a chance to surrender," he said."We wanted to settle matters without bloodshed. But now that bloodhas been spilled there is only one way-pitiless struggle. It wouldbe childish to think we can win by any other means.... The moment isdecisive. Everybody must cooperate with the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, report where there are stores of barbed wire, benzine,guns.... We've won the power; now we must keep it!"The Menshevik Yoffe tried to read his party's declaration, butTrotzky refused to allow "a debate about principle.""Our debates are now in the streets," he cried. "The decisive stephas been taken. We all, and I in particular, take the responsibilityfor what is happening...."Soldiers from the front, from Gatchina, told their stories. One fromthe Death Battalion, Four Hundred Eighty-first Artillery: "When thetrenches hear of this, they will cry, 'This is _our_ Government!'" A_yunker_ from Peterhof said that he and two others had refused tomarch against the Soviets; and when his comrades had returned fromthe defence of the Winter Palace they appointed him their Commissar,to go to Smolny and offer their services to the _real_ Revolution....Then Trotzky again, fiery, indefatigable, giving orders, answeringquestions."The petty bourgeoisie, in order to defeat the workers, soldiers andpeasants, would combine with the devil himself!" he said once. Manycases of drunkenness had been remarked the last two days. "Nodrinking, comrades! No one must be on the streets after eight in theevening, except the regular guards. All places suspected of havingstores of liquor should be searched, and the liquor destroyed. (SeeApp. VIII, Sect. 4) No mercy to the sellers of liquor...."The Military Revolutionary Committee sent for the delegation fromthe Viborg section; then for the members from Putilov. They clumpedout hurriedly."For each revolutionist killed," said Trotzky, "we shall kill fivecounter-revolutionists!"Down-town again. The Duma brilliantly illuminated and great crowdspouring in. In the lower hall wailing and cries of grief; the throngsurged back and forth before the bulletin board, where was posted alist of _yunkers_ killed in the day's fighting-or supposed to bekilled, for most of the dead afterward turned up safe and sound.... Upin the Alexander Hall the Committee for Salvation held forth. Thegold and red epaulettes of officers were conspicuous, the familiarfaces of the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary intellectuals,the hard eyes and bulky magnificence of bankers and diplomats,officials of the old régime, and well-dressed women....The telephone girls were testifying. Girl after girl came to thetribune-over-dressed, fashion-aping little girls, with pinched facesand leaky shoes. Girl after girl, flushing with pleasure at theapplause of the "nice" people of Petrograd, of the officers, therich, the great names of politics-girl after girl, to narrate hersufferings at the hands of the proletariat, and proclaim her loyaltyto all that was old, established and powerful....The Duma was again in session in the Nicolai Hall. The Mayor saidhopefully that the Petrograd regiments were ashamed of theiractions; propaganda was making headway.[Graphic page-205 Proclamation for "wine pogroms" ]Revolutionary law and order. A proclamation of the Finland Regiment,in December, 1917, announcing desperate remedies for "wine pogroms."For translation see Appendix 5.... Emissaries came and went, reporting horrible deeds by theBolsheviki, interceding to save the _yunkers,_ busily investigating...."The Bolsheviki," said Trupp, "will be conquered by moral force, andnot by bayonets....."Meanwhile all was not well on the revolutionary front. The enemy hadbrought up armoured trains, mounted with cannon. The Soviet forces,mostly raw Red Guards, were without officers and without a definiteplan. Only five thousand regular soldiers had joined them; the restof the garrison was either busy suppressing the _yunker_ revolt,guarding the city, or undecided what to do. At ten in the eveningLenin addressed a meeting of delegates from the city regiments, whovoted overwhelmingly to fight. A Committee of five soldiers waselected to serve as General Staff, and in the small hours of themorning the regiments left their barracks in full battle array....Going home I saw them pass, swinging along with the regular tread ofveterans, bayonets in perfect alignment, through the desertedstreets of the conquered city....At the same time, in the headquarters of the _Vikzhel_ down on theSadovaya, the conference of all the Socialist parties to form a newGovernment was under way. Abramovitch, for the centre Mensheviki,said that there should be neither conquerors nor conquered-thatbygones should be bygones. ...In this were agreed all the left wingparties. Dan, speaking in the name of the right Mensheviki, proposedto the Bolsheviki the following conditions for a truce: The RedGuard to be disarmed, and the Petrograd garrison to be placed at theorders of the Duma; the troops of Kerensky not to fire a single shotor arrest a single man; a Ministry of all the Socialist parties_except the Bolsheviki._ For Smolny Riazanov and Kameniev declaredthat a coalition ministry of all parties was acceptable, butprotested at Dan's proposals. The Socialist Revolutionaries weredivided; but the Executive Committee of the Peasants's Soviets andthe Populist Socialists flatly refused to admit the Bolsheviki....After bitter quarrelling a commission was elected to draw up aworkable plan....All that night the commission wrangled, and all the next day, andthe next night. Once before, on the 9th of November, there had beena similar effort at conciliation, led by Martov and Gorky; but atthe approach of Kerensky and the activity of the Committee forSalvation, the right wing of the Mensheviki, SocialistRevolutionaries and Populist Socialists suddenly withdrew. Now theywere awed by the crushing of the _yunker_ rebellion...Monday the 12th was a day of suspense. The eyes of all Russia werefixed on the grey plain beyond the gates of Petrograd, where all theavailable strength of the old order faced the unorganised power ofthe new, the unknown. In Moscow a truce had been declared; bothsides parleyed, awaiting the result in the capital. Now thedelegates to the Congress of Soviets, hurrying on speeding trains tothe farthest reaches of Asia, were coming to their homes, carryingthe fiery cross. In wide-spreading ripples news of the miraclespread over the face of the land, and in its wake towns, cities andfar villages stirred and broke, Soviets and Military RevolutionaryCommittees against Dumas, Zemstvos and Government Commissars-RedGuards against White-street fighting and passionate speech.... Theresult waited on the word from Petrograd....Smolny was almost empty, but the Duma was thronged and noisy. Theold Mayor, in his dignified way, was protesting against the Appealof the Bolshevik Councillors."The Duma is not a centre of counter-revolution," he said, warmly."The Duma takes no part in the present struggle between the parties.But at a time when there is no legal power in the land, the onlycentre of order is the Municipal Self-Government. The peacefulpopulation recognises this fact; the foreign Embassies recogniseonly such documents as are signed by the Mayor of the town. The mindof a European does not admit of any other situation, as theMunicipal self-government is the only organ which is capable ofprotecting the interests of the citizens. The City is bound to showhospitality, to all organisations which desire to profit by suchhospitality, and therefore the Duma cannot prevent the distributionof any newspapers whatever within the Duma building. The sphere ofour work is increasing, and we must be given full liberty of action,and our rights must be respected by both parties...."We are perfectly neutral. When the Telephone Exchange was occupiedby the _yunkers_ Colonel Polkovnikov ordered the telephones toSmolny disconnected, but I protested, and the telephones were keptgoing...."At this there was ironic laughter from the Bolshevik benches, andimprecations from the right."And yet," went on Schreider, "they look upon us ascounter-revolutionaries and report us to the population. Theydeprive us of our means of transport by taking away our lastmotor-cars. It will not be our fault if there is famine in the town.Protests are of no use...."Kobozev, Bolshevik member of the Town Board, was doubtful whetherthe Military Revolutionary Committee had requisitioned the Municipalautomobiles. Even granting the fact, it was probably done by someunauthorised individual, in the emergency."The Mayor," he continued, "tells us that we must not make politicalmeetings out of the Duma. But every Menshevik and SocialistRevolutionary here talks nothing but party propaganda, and at thedoor they distribute their illegal newspapers, _Iskri_ (Sparks),_Soldatski Golos_ and _Rabotchaya Gazeta,_ inciting to insurrection.What if we Bolsheviki should also begin to distribute our papershere? But this shall not be, for we respect the Duma. We have notattacked the Municipal Self-Government, and we shall not do so. Butyou have addressed an Appeal to the population, and we are entitledalso to do so....Followed him Shingariov, Cadet, who said that there could be nocommon language with those who were liable to be brought before theAttorney General for indictment, and who must be tried on the chargeof treason.... He proposed again that all Bolshevik members should beexpelled from the Duma. This was tabled, however, for there were nopersonal charges against the members, and they were active in theMunicipal administration.Then two Mensheviki Internationalists, declaring that the Appeal ofthe Bolshevik Councillors was a direct incitement to massacre. "Ifeverything that is against the Bolsheviki is counter-revolutionary,"said Pinkevitch, "then I do not know the difference betweenrevolution and anarchy.... The Bolsheviki are depending upon thepassions of the unbridled masses; we have nothing but moral force.We will protest against massacres and violence from both sides, asour task is to find a peaceful issue.""The notice posted in the streets under the heading 'To thePillory,' which calls upon the people to destroy the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries," said Nazariev, "is a crime which you,Bolsheviki, will not be able to wash away. Yesterday's horrors arebut a preface to what you are preparing by such a proclamation.... Ihave always tried to reconcile you with the other parties, but atpresent I feel for you nothing but contempt!"The Bolshevik Councillors were on their feet, shouting angrily,assailed by hoarse, hateful voices and waving arms....Outside the hall I ran into the City Engineer, the Menshevik Gombergand three or four reporters. They were all in high spirits."See!" they said. "The cowards are afraid of us. They don't darearrest the Duma! Their Military Revolutionary Committee doesn't dareto send a Commissar into this building. Why, on the corner of theSadovaya to-day, I saw a Red Guard try to stop a boy selling_Soldatski Golos_.... The boy just laughed at him, and a crowd ofpeople wanted to lynch the bandit. It's only a few hours more, now.Even if Kerensky wouldn't come they haven't the men to run aGovernment. Absurd! I understand they're even fighting amongthemselves at Smolny!"A Socialist Revolutionary friend of mine drew me aside. "I knowwhere the Committee for Salvation is hiding," he said. "Do you wantto go and talk with them?"By this time it was dusk. The city had again settled down tonormal-shop-shutters up, lights shining, and on the streets greatcrowds of people slowly moving up and down and arguing....At Number 86 Nevsky we went through a passage into a courtyard,surrounded by tall apartment buildings. At the door of apartment 229my friend knocked in a peculiar way. There was a sound of scuffling;an inside door slammed; then the front door opened a crack and awoman's face appeared. After a minute's observation she led us in-aplacid-looking, middle-aged lady who at once cried, "Kyril, it's allright!" In the dining-room, where a samovar steamed on the table andthere were plates full of bread and raw fish, a man in uniformemerged from behind the window-curtains, and another, dressed like aworkman, from a closet. They were delighted to meet an Americanreporter. With a certain amount of gusto both said that they wouldcertainly be shot if the Bolsheviki caught them. They would not giveme their names, but both were Socialist Revolutionaries...."Why," I asked, "do you publish such lies in your newspapers?"Without taking offence the officer replied, "Yes, I know; but whatcan we do?" He shrugged. "You must admit that it is necessary for usto create a certain frame of mind in the people...."The other man interrupted. "This is merely an adventure on the partof the Bolsheviki. They have no intellectuals. ... The Ministrieswon't work.... Russia is not a city, but a whole country.... Realisingthat they can only last a few days, we have decided to come to theaid of the strongest force opposed to them-Kerensky-and help torestore order.""That is all very well," I said. "But why do you combine with theCadets?"The pseudo-workman smiled frankly. "To tell you the truth, at thismoment the masses of the people are following the Bolsheviki. Wehave no following-now. We can't mobilise a handful of soldiers.There are no arms available.... The Bolsheviki are right to a certainextent; there are at this moment in Russia only two parties with anyforce-the Bolsheviki and the reactionaries, who are all hiding underthe coat-tails of the Cadets. The Cadets think they are using us;but it is really we who are using the Cadets. When we smash theBolsheviki we shall turn against the Cadets....""Will the Bolsheviki be admitted into the new Government?"He scratched his head. "That's a problem," he admitted. "Of courseif they are not admitted, they'sll probably do this all over again.At any rate, they will have a chance to hold the balance of power inthe Constituent-that is, if there _is_ a Constituent.""And then, too," said the officer, "that brings up the question ofadmitting the Cadets into the new Government-and for the samereasons. You know the Cadets do not really want the ConstituentAssembly-not if the Bolsheviki can be destroyed now." He shook hishead. "It is not easy for us Russians, politics. You Americans areborn politicians; you have had politics all your lives. But forus-well, it has only been a year, you know!""What do you think of Kerensky?" I asked."Oh, Kerensky is guilty of the sins of the Provisional Government,"answered the other man. "Kerensky himself forced us to acceptcoalition with the bourgeoisie. If he had resigned, as hethreatened, it would have meant a new Cabinet crisis only sixteenweeks before the Constituent Assembly, and that we wanted to avoid.""But didn't it amount to that anyway?""Yes, but how were we to know? They tricked us-the Kerenskys andAvksentievs. Gotz is a little more radical. I stand with Tchernov,who is a real revolutionist.... Why, only to-day Lenin sent word thathe would not object to Tchernov entering the Government."We wanted to get rid of the Kerensky Government too, but we thoughtit better to wait for the Constituent.... At the beginning of thisaffair I was with the Bolsheviki, but the Central Committee of myparty voted unanimously against it-and what could I do? It was amatter of party discipline...."In a week the Bolshevik Government will go to pieces; if theSocialist Revolutionaries could only stand aside and wait, theGovernment would fall into their hands. But if we wait a week thecountry will be so disorganised that the German imperialists will bevictorious. That is why we began our revolt with only two regimentsof soldiers promising to support us-and they turned against us....That left only the _yunkers_....""How about the Cossacks?"The officer sighed. "They did not move. At first they said theywould come out if they had infantry support. They said moreover thatthey had their men with Kerensky, and that they were doing theirpart.... Then, too, they said that the Cossacks were always accused ofbeing the hereditary enemies of democracy.... And finally, 'TheBolsheviki promise that they will not take away our land. There isno danger to us. We remain neutral.'"During this talk people were constantly entering and leaving-most ofthem officers, their shoulder-straps torn off. We could see them inthe hall, and hear their low, vehement voices. Occasionally, throughthe half-drawn portières, we caught a glimpse of a door opening intoa bath-room, where a heavily-built officer in a colonel's uniformsat on the toilet, writing something on a pad held in his lap. Irecognised Colonel Polkovnikov, former commandant of Petrograd, forwhose arrest the Military Revolutionary Committee would have paid afortune."Our programme?" said the officer. "This is it. Land to be turnedover to the Land Committees. Workmen to have full representation inthe control of industry. An energetic peace programme, but not anultimatum to the world such as the Bolsheviki issued. The Bolshevikicannot keep their promises to the masses, even in the countryitself. We won't let them.... They stole our land programme in orderto get the support of the peasants. That is dishonest. If they hadwaited for the Constituent Assembly-""It doesn't matter about the Constituent Assembly!" broke in theofficer. "If the Bolsheviki want to establish a Socialist statehere, we cannot work with them in any event! Kerensky made the greatmistake. He let the Bolsheviki know what he was going to do byannouncing in the Council of the Republic that he had ordered theirarrest...."But what," I said, "do you intend to do now?"The two men looked at one another. "You will see in a few days. Ifthere are enough troops from the front on our side, we shall notcompromise with the Bolsheviki. If not, perhaps we shall be forcedto...."Out again on the Nevsky we swung on the step of a streetcar bulgingwith people, its platforms bent down from the weight and scrapingalong the ground, which crawled with agonising slowness the longmiles to Smolny.Meshkovsky, a neat, frail little man, was coming down the hall,looking worried. The strikes in the Ministries, he told us, werehaving their effect. For instance, the Council of People'sCommissars had promised to publish the Secret Treaties; but Neratov,the functionary in charge, had disappeared, taking the documentswith him. They were supposed to be hidden in the British Embassy....Worst of all, however, was the strike in the banks. "Without money,"said Menzhinsky, "we are helpless. The wages of the railroad men, ofthe postal and telegraph employees, must be paid.... The banks areclosed; and the key to the situation, the State Bank, is also shut.All the bank-clerks in Russia have been bribed to stop work...."But Lenin has issued an order to dynamite the State Bank vaults,and there is a Decree just out, ordering the private banks to opento-morrow, or we will open them ourselves!"The Petrograd Soviet was in full swing, thronged with armed men,Trotzky reporting:"The Cossacks are falling back from Krasnoye Selo." (Sharp, exultantcheering.) "But the battle is only beginning. At Pulkovo heavyfighting is going on. All available forces must be hurried there...."From Moscow, bad news. The Kremlin is in the hands of the_yunkers,_ and the workers have only a few arms. The result dependsupon Petrograd."At the front, the decrees on Peace and Land are provoking greatenthusiasm. Kerensky is flooding the trenches with tales ofPetrograd burning and bloody, of women and children massacred by theBolsheviki. But no one believes him...."The cruisers _Oleg, Avrora_ and _Respublica_ are anchored in theNeva, their guns trained on the approaches to the city....""Why aren't you out there with the Red Guards?" shouted a roughvoice."I'm going now!" answered Trotzky, and left the platform. His face alittle paler than usual, he passed down the side of the room,         e room,         |          |surrounded by eager friends, and hurried out to the waitingautomobile.Kameniev now spoke, describing the proceedings of the reconciliationconference. The armistice conditions proposed by the Mensheviki, hesaid, had been contemptuously rejected. Even the branches of theRailwaymen's Union had voted against such a proposition...."Now that we've won the power and are sweeping all Russia," hedeclared, "all they ask of us are three little things: 1. Tosurrender the power. 2. To make the soldiers continue the war. 3. Tomake the peasants forget about the land...."Lenin appeared for a moment, to answer the accusations of theSocialist Revolutionaries:"They charge us with stealing their land programme.... If that is so,we bow to them. It is good enough for us...."So the meeting roared on, leader after leader explaining, exhorting,arguing, soldier after soldier, workman after workman, standing upto speak his mind and his heart.... The audience flowed, changing andrenewed continually. From time to time men came in, yelling for themembers of such and such a detachment, to go to the front; others,relieved, wounded, or coming to Smolny for arms and equipment,poured in....It was almost three o'clock in the morning when, as we left thehall, Holtzman, of the Military Revolutionary Committee, camerunning down the hall with a transfigured face."It's all right!" he shouted, grabbing my hands. "Telegram from thefront. Kerensky is smashed! Look at this!"He held out a sheet of paper, scribbled hurriedly in pencil, andthen, seeing we couldn't read it, he declaimed aloud:Pulkovo. Staff. 2.10 A.M.The night of October 30th to 31st will go down in history. Theattempt of Kerensky to move counter-revolutionary troops against thecapital of the Revolution has been decisively repulsed. Kerensky isretreating, we are advancing. The soldiers, sailors and workers ofPetrograd have shown that they can and will with arms in their handsenforce the will and authority of the democracy. The bourgeoisietried to isolate the revolutionary army. Kerensky attempted to breakit by the force of the Cossacks. Both plans met a pitiful defeat.The grand idea of the domination of the worker and peasant democracyclosed the ranks of the army and hardened its will. All the countryfrom now on will be convinced that the Power of the Soviets is noephemeral thing, but an invincible fact.... The repulse of Kerensky isthe repulse of the land-owners, the bourgeoisie and the Kornilovistsin general. The repulse of Kerensky is the confirmation of the rightof the people to a peaceful free life, to land, bread and power. ThePulkovo detachment by its valorous blow has strengthened the causeof the Workers' and Peasants's Revolution. There is no return to thepast. Before us are struggles, obstacles and sacrifices. But theroad is clear and victory is certain.Revolutionary Russia and the Soviet Power can be proud of theirPulkovo detachment, acting under the command of Colonel Walden.Eternal memory to those who fell! Glory to the warriors of theRevolution, the soldiers and the officers who were faithful to thePeople!Long live revolutionary, popular, Socialist Russia!In the name of the Council,L. TROTZKY, People's Commissar....Driving home across Znamensky Square, we made out an unusual crowdin front of the Nicolai Railway Station. Several thousand sailorswere massed there, bristling with rifles.Standing on the steps, a member of the _Vikzhel_ was pleading withthem."Comrades, we cannot carry you to Moscow. We are neutral. We do notcarry troops for either side. We cannot take you to Moscow, wherealready there is terrible civil war...."All the seething Square roared at him; the sailors began to surgeforward. Suddenly another door was flung wide; in it stood two orthree brakeman, a fireman or so."This way, comrades!" cried one. "We will take you to Moscow-orVladivostok, if you like! Long live the Revolution!"                              Chapter IX                               Victory_Order Number I_To the Troops of the Pulkovo Detachment.November 13, 1917. 38 minutes past 9 a. m.After a cruel fight the troops of the Pulkovo detachment completelyrouted the counter-revolutionary forces, who retreated from theirpositions in disorder, and under cover of Tsarskoye Selo fell backtoward Pavlovsk II and Gatchina.Our advanced units occupied the northeastern extremity of TsarskoyeSelo and the station Alexandrovskaya. The Colpinno detachment was onour left, the Krasnoye Selo detachment to our right.I ordered the Pulkovo forces to occupy Tsarskoye Selo, to fortifyits approaches, especially on the side of Gatchina.Also to pass and occupy Pavlovskoye, fortifying its southern side,and to take up the railroad as far as Dno.The troops must take all measures to strengthen the positionsoccupied by them, arranging trenches and other defensive works.They must enter into close liaison with the detachments of Colpinnoand Krasnoye Selo, and also with the Staff of the Commander in Chieffor the Defence of Petrograd.Signed,_Commander in Chief aver all Forces acting against theCounter-revolutionary Troops of Kerensky,_Lieutenant-Colonel MURAVIOV.Tuesday morning. But how is this? Only two days ago the Petrogradcampagna was full of leaderless bands, wandering aimlessly; withoutfood, without artillery, without a plan. What had fused thatdisorganised mass of undisciplined Red Guards, and soldiers withoutofficers, into an army obedient to its own elected high command,tempered to meet and break the assault of cannon and Cossackcavalry? (See App. IX, Sect. 1)People in revolt have a way of defying military precedent. Theragged armies of the French Revolution are not forgotten-Valmy andthe Lines of Weissembourg. Massed against the Soviet forces were_yunkers,_ Cossacks, land-owners, nobility, Black Hundreds-the Tsarcome again, _Okhrana_ and Siberian chains; and the vast and terriblemenace of the Germans.... Victory, in the words of Carlyle, meant"Apotheosis and Millennium without end!"Sunday night, the Commissars of the Military Revolutionary Committeereturning desperately from the field, the garrison of Petrogradelected its Committee of Five, its Battle Staff, three soldiers andtwo officers, all certified free from counter-revolutionary taint.Colonel Muraviov, ex-patriot, was in command-an efficient man, butto be carefully watched. At Colpinno, at Obukhovo, at Pulkovo andKrasnoye Selo were formed provisional detachments, increased in sizeas the stragglers came in from the surrounding country-mixedsoldiers, sailors and Red Guards, parts of regiments, infantry,cavalry and artillery all together, and a few armoured cars.Day broke, and the pickets of Kerensky's Cossacks came in touch.Scattered rifle-fire, summons to surrender. Over the bleak plain onthe cold quiet air spread the sound of battle, falling upon the earsof roving bands as they gathered about their little fires, waiting....So it was beginning! They made toward the battle; and the workerhordes pouring out along the straight roads quickened their pace....Thus upon all the points of attack automatically converged angryhuman swarms, to be met by Commissars and assigned positions, orwork to do. This was _their_ battle, for _their_ world; the officersin command were elected by _them._ For the moment that incoherentmultiple will was one will....Those who participated in the fighting described to me how thesailors fought until they ran out of cartridges, and then stormed;how the untrained workmen rushed the charging Cossacks and tore themfrom their horses; how the anonymous hordes of the people, gatheringin the darkness around the battle, rose like a tide and poured overthe enemy.... Before midnight of Monday the Cossacks broke and werefleeing, leaving their artillery behind them, and the army of theproletariat, on a long ragged front, moved forward and rolled intoTsarskoye, before the enemy had a chance to destroy the greatGovernment wireless station, from which now the Commissars of Smolnywere hurling out to the world paeans of triumph....TO ALL SOVIETS OF WORKERS' AND SOLDIERS' DEPUTIESThe 12th of November, in a bloody combat near Tsarskoye Selo, therevolutionary army defeated the counter-revolutionary troops ofKerensky and Kornilov. In the name of the Revolutionary Government Iorder all regiments to take the offensive against the enemies of therevolutionary democracy, and to take all measures to arrestKerensky, and also to oppose any adventure which might menace theconquests of the Revolution and the victory of the proletariat.Long live the Revolutionary Army!MURAVIOV.News from the provinces....At Sevastopol the local Soviet had assumed the power; a huge meetingof the sailors on the battleships in the harbour had forced theirofficers to line up and swear allegiance to the new Government. AtNizhni Novgorod the Soviet was in control. From Kazan came reportsof a battle in the streets, _yunkers_ and a brigade of artilleryagainst the Bolshevik garrison....Desperate fighting had broken out again in Moscow. The _yunkers_ andWhite Guards held the Kremlin and the centre of the town, beatenupon from all sides by the troops of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. The Soviet artillery was stationed in Skobeliev Square,bombarding the City Duma building, the Prefecture and the HotelMetropole. The cobblestones of the Tverskaya and Nikitskaya had beentorn up for trenches and barricades. A hail of machine-gun fireswept the quarters of the great banks and commercial houses. Therewere no lights, no telephones; the bourgeois population lived in thecellars.... The last bulletin said that the Military RevolutionaryCommittee had delivered an ultimatum to the Committee of PublicSafety, demanding the immediate surrender of the Kremlin, orbombardment would follow."Bombard the Kremlin?" cried the ordinary citizen. "They dare not!"From Vologda to Chita in far Siberia, from Pskov to Sevastopol onthe Black Sea, in great cities and little villages, civil war burstinto flame. From thousands of factories, peasant communes, regimentsand armies, ships on the wide sea, greetings poured intoPetrograd-greetings to the Government of the People.The Cossack Government at Novotcherkask telegraphed to Kerensky,_"The Government of the Cossack troops invites the ProvisionalGovernment and the members of the Council of the Republic to come,if possible, to Novotcherkask, where we can organise in common thestruggle against the Bolsheviki."_In Finland, also, things were stirring. The Soviet of Helsingforsand the _Tsentrobalt_ (Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet),jointly proclaimed a state of siege, and declared that all attemptsto interfere with the Bolshevik forces, and all armed resistance toits orders, would be severely repressed. At the same time theFinnish Railway Union called a countrywide general strike, to putinto operation the laws passed by the Socialist Diet of June, 1917,dissolved by Kerensky....Early in the morning I went out to Smolny. Going up the long woodensidewalk from the outer gate I saw the first thin, hesitatingsnow-flakes fluttering down from the grey, windless sky. "Snow!"cried the soldier at the door, grinning with delight. "Good for thehealth!" Inside, the long, gloomy halls and bleak rooms seemeddeserted. No one moved in all the enormous pile. A deep, uneasysound came to my ears, and looking around, I noticed that everywhereon the floor, along the walls, men were sleeping. Rough, dirty men,workers and soldiers, spattered and caked with mud, sprawled aloneor in heaps, in the careless attitudes of death. Some wore raggedbandages marked with blood. Guns and cartridge-belts were scatteredabout.... The victorious proletarian army!In the upstairs buffet so thick they lay that one could hardly walk.The air was foul. Through the clouded windows a pale light streamed.A battered samovar, cold, stood on the counter, and many glassesholding dregs of tea. Beside them lay a copy of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee's last bulletin, upside down, scrawled withpainful hand-writing. It was a memorial written by some soldier tohis comrades fallen in the fight against Kerensky, just as he hadset it down before falling on the floor to sleep. The writing wasblurred with what looked like tears....Alexei VinogradovD. MaskvinS. StolbikovA. VoskressenskyD. LeonskyD. PreobrazhenskyV. LaidanskyM.

Under the earth of the grave__You have straitly closed your ranks. Sleep, Citizens!_Only the Military Revolutionary Committee still functioned,unsleeping. Skripnik, emerging from the inner room, said that Gotzhad been arrested, but had flatly denied signing the proclamation ofthe Committee for Salvation, as had Avksentiev; and the Committeefor Salvation itself had repudiated the Appeal to the garrison.There was still disafiection among the city regiments, Skripnikreported; the Volhynsky Regiment had refused to fight againstKerensky.Several detachments of "neutral" troops, with Tchernov at theirhead, were at Gatchina, trying to persuade Kerensky to halt hisattack on Petrograd.Skripnik laughed. "There can be no 'neutrals' now," he said. "We'vewon!" His sharp, bearded face glowed with an almost religiousexaltation. "More than sixty delegates have arrived from the Front,with assurances of support by all the armies except the troops onthe Rumanian front, who have not been heard from. The ArmyCommittees have suppressed all news from Petrograd, but we now havea regular system of couriers...."[Graphic page-224 Certificate approving telegram transmission]Order given me at Staff headquarters by command of the Council ofPeople's Commissars, to transmit the first despatch out of Perogradafter the November Revolution, over the Government wires to America.

For the Commander in Chief, ANTONOV                      Chief of Staff, VLAD. BONCH-BRUEVITCHDown in the front hall Kameniev was just entering, worn out by theall-night session of the Conference to Form a New Government, buthappy. "Already the Socialist Revolutionaries are inclined to admitus into the new Government," he told me. "The right wing groups arefrightened by the Revolutionary Tribunals; they demand, in a sort ofpanic, that we dissolve them before going any further. ... We haveaccepted the proposition of the _Vikzhel_ to form a homogeneousSocialist Ministry, and they're working on that now. You see, it allsprings from our victory. When we were down, they would't have us atany price; not everybody's in favour of some agreement with theSoivets.... What we need is a really decisive victory. Kerensky wantsan armistice, but he'll have to surrender (See App. IX, Sect. 2) ...."That was the temper of the Bolshevik leaders. To a foreignjournalist who asked Trotzky what statement he had to make to theworld, Trotzky replied: "At this moment the only statement possibleis the one we are making through the mouths of our cannon!"But there was an undercurrent of real anxiety in the tide ofvictory; the question of finances. Instead of opening the banks, ashad been ordered by the Military Revolutionary Committee, the Unionof Bank Employees had held a meeting and declared a formal strike.Smolny had demanded some thirty-five millions of rubles from theState Bank, and the cashier had locked the vaults, only paying outmoney to the representatives of the Provisional Government. Thereactionaries were using the State Bank as a political weapon; forinstance, when the _Vikzhel_ demanded money to pay the salaries ofthe employees of the Government railroads, it was told to apply toSmolny....I went to the State Bank to see the new Commissar, a redhairedUkrainean Bolshevik named Petrovitch. He was trying to bring orderout of the chaos in which affairs had been left by the strikingclerks. In all the offices of the huge place perspiring volunteerworkers, soldiers and sailors, their tongues sticking out of theirmouths in the intensity of their effort, were poring over the greatledgers with a bewildered air....The Duma building was crowded. There were still isolated cases ofdefiance toward the new Government, but they were rare. The CentralLand Committee had appealed to the Peasants, ordering them not torecognise the Land Decree passed by the Congress of the Soviets,because it would cause confusion and civil war. Mayor Schreiderannounced that because of the Bolshevik insurrection, the electionsto the Constituent Assembly would have to be indefinitely postponed.Two questions seemed to be uppermost in all minds, shocked by theferocity of the civil war; first, a truce to the bloodshed (See App.IX, Sect. 3)-second, the creation of a new Government. There was nolonger any talk of "destroying the Bolsheviki"-and very little aboutexcluding them from the Government, except from the PopulistSocialists and the Peasants' Soviets. Even the Central ArmyCommittee at the _Stavka,_ the most determined enemy of Smolny,telephoned from Moghilev: "If, to constitute the new Ministry, it isnecessary to come to an understanding with the Bolsheviki, we agreeto admit them _in a minority_ to the Cabinet."_Pravda,_ ironically calling attention to Kerensky's "humanitariansentiments," published his despatch to the Committee for Salvation:In accord with the proposals of the Committee for Salvation and allthe democratic organisations united around it, I have halted allmilitary action against the rebels. A delegate of the Committee hasbeen sent to enter into negotiations. Take all measures to stop theuseless shedding of blood.The _Vikzhel_ sent a telegram to all Russia:The Conference of the Union of Railway Workers with therepresentatives of both the belligerent parties, who admit thenecessity of an agreement, protest energetically against the use ofpolitical terrorism in the civil war, especially when it is carriedon between different factions of the revolutionary democracy, anddeclare that political terrorism, in whatever form, is incontradiction to the very idea of the negotiations for a newGovernment....[Graphic page-227 Leaflet ]Popular leaflet sold in the streets just after the Bolshevikinsurrection, containing rhymes and jokes about the defeatedbourgeoisie and the "moderate" Socialist leaders, Called, "How THEBOORZHUI (BOURGEOISIE) LOST THE POWER."Delegations from the Conference were sent to the Front, to Gatchina.In the Conference itself everything seemed on the point of finalsettlement. It had even been decided to elect a Provisional People'sCouncil, composed of about four hundred members-seventy-fiverepresenting Smolny, seventy-five the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and therest split up among the Town Dumas, the Trade Unions, LandCommittees and political parties. Tchernov was mentioned as the newPremier. Lenin and Trotzky, rumour said, were to be excluded....About noon I was again in front of Smolny, talking with the driverof an ambulance bound for the revolutionary front. Could I go withhim? Certainly! He was a volunteer, a University student, and as werolled down the street shouted over his shoulder to me phrases ofexecrable German: _"Also, gut! Wir nach die Kasernen zu essengehen!"_ I made out that there would be lunch at some barracks.On the Kirotchnaya we turned into an immense courtyard surrounded bymilitary buildings, and mounted a dark stairway to a low room lit byone window. At a long wooden table were seated some twenty soldiers,eating _shtchi_ (cabbage soup) from a great tin wash-tub with woodenspoons, and talking loudly with much laughter."Welcome to the Battalion Committee of the Sixth Reserve Engineers'Battalion!" cried my friend, and introduced me as an AmericanSocialist. Whereat every one rose to shake my hand, and one oldsoldier put his arms around me and gave me a hearty kiss. A woodenspoon was produced and I took my place at the table. Another tub,full of _kasha,_ was brought in, a huge loaf of black bread, and ofcourse the inevitable tea-pots. At once every one began asking mequestions about America: Was it true that people in a free countrysold their votes for _money?_ If so, how did they get what theywanted? How about this "Tammany"? Was it true that in a free countrya little group of people could control a whole city, and exploitedit for their personal benefit? Why did the people stand it? Evenunder the Tsar such things could not happen in Russia; true, herethere was always graft, but to buy and sell a whole city full ofpeople! And in a free country! Had the people no revolutionaryfeeling? I tried to explain that in my country people tried tochange things by law."Of course," nodded a young sergeant, named Baklanov, who spokeFrench. "But you have a highly developed capitalist class? Then thecapitalist class must control the legislatures and the courts. Howthen can the people change things? I am open to conviction, for I donot know your country; but to me it is incredible...."I said that I was going to Tsarskoye Selo. "I, too," said Baklanov,suddenly. "And I-and I-" The whole roomful decided on the spot to goto Tsarskoye Selo.Just then came a knock on the door. It opened, and in it stood thefigure of the Colonel. No one rose, but all shouted a greeting. "MayI come in?" asked the Colonel. "_Prosim! Prosim!_" they answeredheartily. He entered, smiling, a tall, distinguished figure in agoat-skin cape embroidered with gold. "I think I heard you say thatyou were going to Tsarskoye Selo, comrades," he said. "Could I gowith you?"Baklanov considered. "I do not think there is anything to be donehere to-day," he answered. "Yes, comrade, we shall be very glad tohave you." The Colonel thanked him and sat down, filling a glass oftea.In a low voice, for fear of wounding the Colonel's pride, Baklanovexplained to me. "You see, I am the chairman of the Committee. Wecontrol the Battalion absolutely, except in action, when the Colonelis delegated by us to command. In action his orders must be obeyed,but he is strictly responsible to us. In barracks he must ask ourpermission before taking any action.... You might call him ourExecutive Officer...."Arms were distributed to us, revolvers and rifles-"we might meetsome Cossacks, you know"-and we all piled into the ambulance,together with three great bundles of newspapers for the front.Straight down the Liteiny we rattled, and along the ZagorodnyProspekt. Next to me sat a youth with the shoulder-straps of aLieutenant, who seemed to speak all European languages with equalfluency. He was a member of the Battalion Committee."I am not a Bolshevik," he assured me, emphatically. "My family is avery ancient and noble one. I, myself, am, you might say, a Cadet....""But how--?" I began, bewildered."Oh, yes, I am a member of the Committee. I make no secret of mypolitical opinions, but the others do not mind, because they know Ido not believe in opposing the will of the majority.... I have refusedto take any action in the present civil war, however, for I do notbelieve in taking up arms against my brother Russians....""Provocator! Kornilovitz!" the others cried at him gaily, slappinghim on the shoulder....Passing under the huge grey stone archway of the Moskovsky Gate,covered with golden hieroglyphics, ponderous Imperial eagles and thenames of Tsars, we sped out on the wide straight highway, grey withthe first light fall of snow. It was thronged with Red Guards,stumbling along on foot toward the revolutionary front, shouting andsinging; and others, greyfaced and muddy, coming back. Most of themseemed to be mere boys. Women with spades, some with rifles andbandoleers, others wearing the Red Cross on their arm-bands-thebowed, toil-worm women of the slums. Squads of soldiers marching outof step, with an affectionate jeer for the Red Guards; sailors,grim-looking; children with bundles of food for their fathers andmothers; all these, coming and going, trudged through the whitenedmud that covered the cobbles of the highway inches deep. We passedcannon, jingling southward with their caissons; trucks bound bothways, bristling with armed men; ambulances full of wounded from thedirection of the battle, and once a peasant cart, creaking slowlyalong, in which sat a white-faced boy bent over his shatteredstomach and screaming monotonously. In the fields on either sidewomen and old men were digging trenches and stringing barbed wireentanglements.Back northward the clouds rolled away dramatically, and the pale suncame out. Across the flat, marshy plain Petrograd glittered. To theright, white and gilded and coloured bulbs and pinnacles; to theleft, tall chimneys, some pouring out black smoke; and beyond, alowering sky over Finland. On each side of us were churches,monasteries.... Occasionally a monk was visible, silently watching thepulse of the proletarian army throbbing on the road.At Pulkovo the road divided, and there we halted in the midst of agreat crowd, where the human streams poured from three directions,friends meeting, excited and congratulatory, describing the battleto one another. A row of houses facing the cross-roads was markedwith bullets, and the earth was trampled into mud half a milearound. The fighting had been furious here.... In the near distanceriderless Cossack horses circled hungrily, for the grass of theplain had died long ago. Right in front of us an awkward Red Guardwas trying to ride one, falling off again and again, to thechildlike delight of a thousand rough men.The left road, along which the remnants of the Cossacks hadretreated, led up a little hill to a hamlet, where there was aglorious view of the immense plain, grey as a windless sea,tumultuous clouds towering over, and the imperial city disgorgingits thousands along all the roads. Far over to the left lay thelittle hill of Kranoye Selo, the parade-ground of the ImperialGuards' summer camp, and the Imperial Dairy. In the middle distancenothing broke the flat monotony but a few walled monasteries andconvents, some isolated factories, and several large buildings withunkempt grounds that were asylums and orphanages...."Here," said the driver, as we went on over a barren hill, "here waswhere Vera Slutskaya died. Yes, the Bolshevik member of the Duma. Ithappened early this morning. She was in an automobile, with Zalkindand another man. There was a truce, and they started for the fronttrenches. They were talking and laughing, when all of a sudden, fromthe armoured train in which Kerensky himself was riding, somebodysaw the automobile and fired a cannon. The shell struck VeraSlutskaya and killed her...."And so we came into Tsarskoye, all bustling with the swaggeringheroes of the proletarian horde. Now the palace where the Soviet hadmet was a busy place. Red Guards and sailors filled the court-yard,sentries stood at the doors, and a stream of couriers and Commissarspushed in and out. In the Soviet room a samovar had been set up, andfifty or more workers, soldiers, sailors and officers stood around,drinking tea and talking at the top of their voices. In one cornertwo clumsy-handed workingmen were trying to make a multigraphingmachine go. At the centre table, the huge Dybenko bent over a map,marking out positions for the troops with red and blue pencils. Inhis free hand he carried, as always, the enormous bluesteelrevolver. Anon he sat himself down at a typewriter and pounded awaywith one finger; every little while he would pause, pick up therevolver, and lovingly spin the chamber.A couch lay along the wall, and on this was stretched a youngworkman. Two Red Guards were bending over him, but the rest of thecompany did not pay any attention. In his breast was a hole; throughhis clothes fresh blood came welling up with every heart-beat. Hiseyes were closed and his young, bearded face was greenish-white.Faintly and slowly he still breathed, with every breath sighing,_"Mir boudit! Mir boudit!_ (Peace is coming! Peace is coming!)"Dybenko looked up as we came in. "Ah," he said to Baklanov."Comrade, will you go up to the Commandant's headquarters and takecharge? Wait; I will write you credentials." He went to thetypewriter and slowly picked out the letters.The new Commandant of Tsarskoye Selo and I went toward the EkaterinaPalace, Baklanov very excited and important. In the same ornate,white room some Red Guards were rummaging curiously around, while myold friend, the Colonel, stood by the window biting his moustache.He greeted me like a long-lost brother. At a table near the door satthe French Bessarabian. The Bolsheviki had ordered him to remain,and continue his work."What could I do?" he muttered. "People like myself cannot fight oneither side in such a war as this, no matter how much we mayinstinctively dislike the dictatorship of the mob.... I only regretthat I am so far from my mother in Bessarabia!"Baklanov was formally taking over the office from the Commandant."Here," said the Colonel nervously, "are the keys to the desk."A Red Guard interrupted. "Where's the money?" he asked rudely. TheColonel seemed surprised. "Money? Money? Ah, you mean the chest.There it is," said the Colonel, "just as I found it when I tookpossession three days ago. Keys?" The Colonel shrugged. "I have nokeys."The Red Guard sneered knowingly. "Very convenient," he said."Let us open the chest," said Baklanov. "Bring an axe. Here is anAmerican comrade. Let him smash the chest open, and write down whathe finds there."I swung the axe. The wooden chest was empty."Let's arrest him," said the Red Guard, venomously. "He isKerensky's man. He has stolen the money and given it to Kerensky."Baklanov did not want to. "Oh, no," he said. "It was the Kornilovitzbefore him. He is not to blame."The devil!" cried the Red Guard. "He is Kerensky's man, I tell you.If _you_ won't arrest him, then _we_ will, and we'll take him toPetrograd and put him in Peter-Paul, where he belongs!" At this theother Red Guards growled assent. With a piteous glance at us theColonel was led away....Down in front of the Soviet palace an auto-truck was going to thefront. Half a dozen Red Guards, some sailors, and a soldier or two,under command of a huge workman, clambered in, and shouted to me tocome along. Red Guards issued from headquarters, each of themstaggering under an arm-load of small, corrugated-iron bombs, filledwith _grubit_-which, they say, is ten times as strong, and fivetimes as sensitive as dynamite; these they threw into the truck. Athree-inch cannon was loaded and then tied onto the tail of thetruck with bits of rope and wire.We started with a shout, at top speed of course; the heavy truckswaying from side to side. The cannon leaped from one wheel to theother, and the _grubit_ bombs went rolling back and forth over ourfeet, fetching up against the sides of the car with a crash.The big Red Guard, whose name was Vladimir Nicolaievitch, plied mewith questions about America. "Why did America come into the war?Are the American workers ready to throw over the capitalists? Whatis the situation in the Mooney case now? Will they extradite Berkmanto San Francisco?" and other, very difficult to answer, alldelivered in a shout above the roaring of the truck, while we heldon to each other and danced amid the caroming bombs.Occasionally a patrol tried to stop us. Soldiers ran out into theroad before us, shouted _"Shtoi!"_ and threw up their guns.We paid no attention. "The devil take you!" cried the Red Guards."We don't stop for anybody! We're Red Guards!" And we thunderedimperiously on, while Vladimir Nicolaievitch bellowed to me aboutthe internationalisation of the Panama Canal, and such matters....About five miles out we saw a squad of sailors marching back, andslowed down."Where's the front, brothers?"The foremost sailor halted and scratched his head. "This morning,"he said, "it was about half a kilometer down the road. But the damnthing isn't anywhere now. We walked and walked and walked, but wecouldn't find it."They climbed into the truck, and we proceeded. It must have beenabout a mile further that Vladimir Nicolaievitch cocked his ear andshouted to the chauffeur to stop."Firing!" he said. "Do you hear it?" For a moment dead silence, andthen, a little ahead and to the left, three shots in rapidsuccession. Along here the side of the road was heavily wooded. Verymuch excited now, we crept along, speaking in whispers, until thetruck was nearly opposite the place where the firing had come from.Descending, we spread out, and every man carrying his rifle, wentstealthily into the forest.Two comrades, meanwhile, detached the cannon and slewed it arounduntil it aimed as nearly as possible at our backs.It was silent in the woods. The leaves were gone, and thetree-trunks were a pale wan colour in the low, sickly autumn sun.Not a thing moved, except the ice of little woodland pools shiveringunder our feet. Was it an ambush?We went uneventfully forward until the trees began to thin, andpaused. Beyond, in a little clearing, three soldiers sat around asmall fire, perfectly oblivious.Vladimir Nicolaievitch stepped forward. _"Zra'zvuitye,_ comrades!"he greeted, while behind him one cannon, twenty rifles and atruck-load of _grubit_ bombs hung by a hair. The soldiers scrambledto their feet."What was the shooting going on around here?"One of the soldiers answered, looking relieved, "Why we were justshooting a rabbit or two, comrade...."The truck hurtled on toward Romanov, through the bright, empty day.At the first cross-roads two soldiers ran out in front of us, wavingtheir rifles. We slowed down, and stopped."Passes, comrades!"The Red Guards raised a great clamour. "We are Red Guards. We don'tneed any passes.... Go on, never mind them!"But a sailor objected. "This is wrong, comrades. We must haverevolutionary discipline. Suppose some counterrevolutionaries camealong in a truck and said: 'We don't need any passes?' The comradesdon't know you."At this there was a debate. One by one, however, the sailors andsoldiers joined with the first. Grumbling, each Red Guard producedhis dirty _bumaga_ (paper). All were alike except mine, which hadbeen issued by the Revolutionary Staff at Smolny. The sentriesdeclared that I must go with them. The Red Guards objectedstrenuously, but the sailor who had spoken first insisted. "Thiscomrade we know to be a true comrade," he said. "But there areorders of the Committee, and these orders must be obeyed. That isrevolutionary discipline...."In order not to make any trouble, I got down from the truck, andwatched it disappear careening down the road, all the company wavingfarewell. The soldiers consulted in low tones for a moment, and thenled me to a wall, against which they placed me. It flashed upon mesuddenly; they were going to shoot me!In all three directions not a human being was in sight. The onlysign of life was smoke from the chimney of a _datchya,_ a ramblingwooden house a quarter of a mile up the side road. The two soldierswere walking out into the road. Desperately I ran after them."But comrades! See! Here is the seal of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee!"They stared stupidly at my pass, then at each other."It is different from the others," said one, sullenly. "We cannotread, brother."I took him by the arm. "Come!" I said. "Let's go to that house. Someone there can surely read." They hesitated. "No," said one. Theother looked me over. "Why not?" he muttered. "After all, it is aserious crime to kill an innocent man."We walked up to the front door of the house and knocked. A short,stout woman opened it, and shrank back in alarm, babbling, "I don'tknow anything about them! I don't know anything about them!" One ofmy guards held out the pass. She screamed. "Just to read it,comrade." Hesitatingly she took the paper and read aloud, swiftly:The bearer of this pass, John Reed, is a representative of theAmerican Social-Democracy, an internationalist....Out on the road again the two soldiers held another consultation."We must take you to the Regimental Committee," they said. In thefast-deepening twilight we trudged along the muddy road.Occasionally we met squads of soldiers, who stopped and surroundedme with looks of menace, handling my pass around and arguingviolently as to whether or not I should be killed....It was dark when we came to the barracks of the Second TsarskoyeSelo Rifles, low sprawling buildings huddled along the post-road. Anumber of soldiers slouching at the entrance asked eager questions.A spy? A provocator? We mounted a winding stair and emerged into agreat, bare room with a huge stove in the centre, and rows of cotson the floor, where about a thousand soldiers were playing cards,talking, singing, and asleep. In the roof was a jagged hole made byKerensky's cannon....I stood in the doorway, and a sudden silence ran among the groups,who turned and stared at me. Of a sudden they began to move, slowlyand then with a rush, thundering, with faces full of hate."Comrades! Comrades!" yelled one of my guards. "Committee!Committee!" The throng halted, banked around me, muttering. Out ofthem shouldered a lean youth, wearing a red arm-band."Who is this?" he asked roughly. The guards explained. "Give me thepaper!" He read it carefully, glancing at me with keen eyes. Then hesmiled and handed me the pass. "Comrades, this is an Americancomrade. I am Chairman of the Committee, and I welcome you to theRegiment...." A sudden general buzz grew into a roar of greeting, andthey pressed forward to shake my hand."You have not dined? Here we have had our dinner. You shall go tothe Officers' Club, where there are some who speak your language...."He led me across the court-yard to the door of another building. Anaristocratic-looking youth, with the shoulder straps of aLieutenant, was entering. The Chairman presented me, and shakinghands, went back."I am Stepan Georgevitch Morovsky, at your service," said theLieutenant, in perfect French. From the ornate entrance hall aceremonial staircase led upward, lighted by glittering lustres. Onthe second floor billiard-rooms, card-rooms, a library opened fromthe hall. We entered the dining-room, at a long table in the centreof which sat about twenty officers in full uniform, wearing theirgold- and silver-handled swords, the ribbons and crosses of Imperialdecorations. All rose politely as I entered, and made a place for mebeside the Colonel, a large, impressive man with a grizzled beard.Orderlies were deftly serving dinner. The atmosphere was that of anyofficers' mess in Europe. Where was the Revolution?"You are not Bolsheviki?" I asked Morovsky.A smile went around the table, but I caught one or two glancingfurtively at the orderly."No," answered my friend. "There is only one Bolshevik officer inthis regiment. He is in Petrograd to-night. The Colonel is aMenshevik. Captain Kherlov there is a Cadet. I myself am a SocialistRevolutionary of the right wing.... I should say that most of theofficers in the Army are not Bolsheviki, but like me they believe indemocracy; they believe that they must follow the soldier-masses...."Dinner over, maps were brought, and the Colonel spread them out onthe table. The rest crowded around to see."Here," said the Colonel, pointing to pencil marks, "were ourpositions this morning. Vladimir Kyrilovitch, where is your company?"Captain Kherlov pointed. "According to orders, we occupied theposition along this road. Karsavin relieved me at five o'clock."Just then the door of the room opened, and there entered theChairman of the Regimental Committee, with another soldier. Theyjoined the group behind the Colonel, peering at the map.              map.              |          |"Good," said the Colonel. "Now the Cossacks have fallen back tenkilometres in our sector. I do not think it is necessary to take upadvanced positions. Gentlemen, for to-night you will hold thepresent line, strengthening the positions by--""If you please," interrupted the Chairman of the RegimentalCommittee. "The orders are to advance with all speed, and prepare toengage the Cossacks north of Gatchina in the morning. A crushingdefeat is necessary. Kindly make the proper dispositions."There was a short silence. The Colonel again turned to the map."Very well," he said, in a different voice. "Stepan Georgevitch, youwill please--" Rapidly tracing lines with a blue pencil, he gave hisorders, while a sergeant made shorthand notes. The sergeant thenwithdrew, and ten minutes later returned with the orderstypewritten, and one carbon copy. The Chairman of the Committeestudied the map with a copy of the orders before him."All right," he said, rising. Folding the carbon copy, he put it inhis pocket. Then he signed the other, stamped it with a round sealtaken from his pocket, and presented it to the Colonel....Here was the Revolution!I returned to the Soviet palace in Tsarskoye in the Regimental Staffautomobile. Still the crowds of workers, soldiers and sailorspouring in and out, still the choking press of trucks, armouredcars, cannon before the door, and the shouting, the laughter ofunwonted victory. Half a dozen Red Guards forced their way through,a priest in the middle. This was Father Ivan, they said, who hadblessed the Cossacks when they entered the town. I heard afterwardthat he was shot.... (See App. IX, Sect. 4)Dybenko was just coming out, giving rapid orders right and left. Inhis hand he carried the big revolver. An automobile stood withracing engine at the kerb. Alone, he climbed in the rear seat, andwas off-off to Gatchina, to conquer Kerensky.Toward nightfall he arrived at the outskirts of the town, and wenton afoot. What Dybenko told the Cossacks nobody knows, but the factis that General Krasnov and his staff and several thousand Cossackssurrendered, and advised Kerensky to do the same. (See App. IX,Sect. 5)As for Kerensky-I reprint here the deposition made by GeneralKrasnov on the morning of November 14th:"Gatchina, November 14, 1917. To-day, about three o'clock (A. M.), Iwas summoned by the Supreme Commander (Kerensky). He was veryagitated, and very nervous."'General,' he said to me, 'you have betrayed me. Your Cossacksdeclare categorically that they will arrest me and deliver me to thesailors.'"'Yes,' I answered, 'there is talk of it, and I know that you haveno sympathy anywhere.'"'But the officers say the same thing.'"'Yes, most of all it is the officers who are discontented with you.'"'What shall I do? I ought to commit suicide!'"'If you are an honorable man, you will go immediately to Petrogradwith a white flag, you will present yourself to the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee, and enter into negotiations as Chief of theProvisional Government.'"'All right. I will do that, General.'"'I will give you a guard and ask that a sailor go with you.'"'No, no, not a sailor. Do you know whether it is true that Dybenkois here?'"'I don't know who Dybenko is.'"'He is my enemy."'There is nothing to do. If you play for high stakes you must knowhow to take a chance.'"'Yes. I'll leave to-night!'"'Why? That would be a flight. Leave calmly and openly, so thatevery one can see that you are not running away.'"'Very well. But you must give me a guard on which I can count.'"'Good.'"I went out and called the Cossack Russkov, of the Tenth Regiment ofthe Don, and ordered him to pick out ten Cossacks to accompany theSupreme Commander. Half an hour later the Cossacks came to tell methat Kerensky was not in his quarters, that he had run away."I gave the alarm and ordered that he be searched for, supposingthat he could not have left Gatchina, but he could not be found...."And so Kerensky fled, alone, "disguised in the uniform of a sailor,"and by that act lost whatever popularity he had retained among theRussian masses....I went back to Petrograd riding on the front seat of an auto truck,driven by a workman and filled with Red Guards. We had no kerosene,so our lights were not burning. The road was crowded with theproletarian army going home, and new reserves pouring out to taketheir places. Immense trucks like ours, columns of artillery,wagons, loomed up in the night, without lights, as we were. Wehurtled furiously on, wrenched right and left to avoid collisionsthat seemed inevitable, scraping wheels, followed by the epithets ofpedestrians.Across the horizon spread the glittering lights of the capital,immeasurably more splendid by night than by day, like a dike ofjewels heaped on the barren plain.The old workman who drove held the wheel in one hand, while with theother he swept the far-gleaming capital in an exultant gesture."Mine!" he cried, his face all alight. "All mine now! My Petrograd!"                              Chapter X                                MoscowThe Military Revolutionary Committee, with a fierce intensity,followed up its victory:November 14th.To all Army, corps, divisional and regimental Committees, to allSoviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, to all, all,all.Conforming to the agreement between the Cossacks, _yunkers,_soldiers, sailors and workers, it has been decided to arraignAlexander Feodorvitch Kerensky before a tribunal of the people. Wedemand that Kerensky be arrested, and that he be ordered, in the nameof the organisations hereinafter mentioned, to come immediately toPetrograd and present himself to the tribunal.Signed,_The Cossacks of the First Division of Ussuri Cavalry; the Committeeof Yunkers of the Petrograd detachment of Franc-Tireurs; the delegateof the Fifth Army._People's Commissar DYBENKO.The Committee for Salvation, the Duma, the Central Committee of theSocialist Revolutionary party-proudly claiming Kerensky as amember-all passionately protested that he could only be heldresponsible to the Constituent Assembly.On the evening of November 16th I watched two thousand Red Guardsswing down the Zagorodny Prospekt behind a military band playing the_Marseillaise_-and how appropriate it sounded-with blood-red flagsover the dark ranks of workmen, to welcome home again their brotherswho had defended "Red Petrograd." In the bitter dusk they tramped,men and women, their tall bayonets swaying; through streets faintlylighted and slippery with mud, between silent crowds of bourgeois,contemptuous but fearful....All were against them-business men, speculators, investors,land-owners, army officers, politicians, teachers, students,professional men, shop-keepers, clerks, agents. The other Socialistparties hated the Bolsheviki with an implacable hatred. On the sideof the Soviets were the rank and file of the workers, the sailors,all the undemoralised soldiers, the landless peasants, and a few-avery few-intellectuals....From the farthest corners of great Russia, whereupon desperatestreet-fighting burst like a wave, news of Kerensky's defeat cameechoing back the immense roar of proletarian victory. Kazan, Saratov,Novgorod, Vinnitza-where the streets had run with blood; Moscow,where the Bolsheviki had turned their artillery against the laststrong-hold of the bourgeoisie-the Kremlin."They are bombarding the Kremlin!" The news passed from mouth tomouth in the streets of Petrograd, almost with a sense of terror.Travellers from "white and shining little mother Moscow" told fearfultales. Thousands killed; the Tverskaya and the Kuznetsky Most inflames; the church of Vasili Blazheiny a smoking ruin; UsspenskyCathedral crumbling down; the Spasskaya Gate of the Kremlintottering; the Duma burned to the ground. (See App. X, Sect. 1)Nothing that the Bolsheviki had done could compare with this fearfulblasphemy in the heart of Holy Russia. To the ears of the devoutsounded the shock of guns crashing in the face of the Holy OrthodoxChurch, and pounding to dust the sanctuary of the Russian nation....On November 15th, Lunatcharsky, Commissar of Education, broke intotears at the session of the Council of People's Commissars, andrushed from the room, crying, "I cannot stand it! I cannot bear themonstrous destruction of beauty and tradition...."That afternoon his letter of resignation was published in thenewspapers:I have just been informed, by people arriving from Moscow, what hashappened there.The Cathedral of St. Basil the Blessed, the Cathedral of theAssumption, are being bombarded. The Kremlin, where are now gatheredthe most important art treasures of Petrograd and of Moscow, is underartillery fire. There are thousands of victims.The fearful struggle there has reached a pitch of bestial ferocity.What is left? What more can happen?I cannot bear this. My cup is full. I am unable to endure thesehorrors. It is impossible to work under the pressure of thoughtswhich drive me mad!That is why I am leaving the Council of People's Commissars.I fully realise the gravity of this decision. But I can bear nomore.... (See App. X, Sect. 2)That same day the White Guards and _yunkers_ in the Kremlinsurrendered, and were allowed to march out unharmed. The treaty ofpeace follows:1. The Committee of Public Safety ceases to exist.2. The White Guard gives up its arms and dissolves. The officersretain their swords and regulations side-arms. In the MilitarySchools are retained only the arms necessary for instruction; allothers are surrendered by the _yunkers._ The Military RevolutionaryCommittee guarantees the liberty and inviolability of the person.3. To settle the question of disarmament, as set forth in section 2,a special commission is appointed, consisting of representatives fromall organisations which took part in the peace negotiations.4. From the moment of the signature of this peace treaty, bothparties shall immediately give order to cease firing and halt allmilitary operations, taking measures to ensure punctual obedience tothis order.5. At the signature of the treaty, all prisoners made by the twoparties shall be released....For two days now the Bolsheviki had been in control of the city. Thefrightened citizens were creeping out of their cellars to seek theirdead; the barricades in the streets were being removed. Instead ofdiminishing, however, the stories of destruction in Moscow continuedto grow.... And it was under the influence of these fearful reportsthat we decided to go there.Petrograd, after all, in spite of being for a century the seat ofGovernment, is still an artificial city. Moscow is real Russia,Russia as it was and will be; in Moscow we would get the true feelingof the Russian people about the Revolution. Life was more intensethere.For the past week the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee,aided by the rank and file of the Railway Workers, had seized controlof the Nicolai Railroad, and hurled trainload after trainload ofsailors and Red Guards southwest.... We were provided with passes fromSmolny, without which no one could leave the capital.... When the trainbacked into the station, a mob of shabby soldiers, all carrying hugesacks of eatables, stormed the doors, smashed the windows, and pouredinto all the compartments, filling up the aisles and even climbingonto the roof. Three of us managed to wedge our way into acompartment, but almost immediately about twenty soldiers entered....There was room for only four people; we argued, expostulated, and theconductor joined us-but the soldiers merely laughed. Were they tobother about the comfort of a lot of _boorzhui_ (bourgeois)? Weproduced the passes from Smolny; instantly the soldiers changed theirattitude."Come, comrades," cried one, "these are American _tovarishtchi._ Theyhave come thirty thousand versts to see our Revolution, and they arenaturally tired...."With polite and friendly apologies the soldiers began to leave.Shortly afterward we heard them breaking into a compartment occupiedby two stout, well-dressed Russians, who had bribed the conductor andlocked their door....About seven o'clock in the evening we drew out of the station, animmense long train drawn by a weak little locomotive burning wood,and stumbled along slowly, with many stops. The soldiers on the roofkicked with their heels and sang whining peasant songs; and in thecorridor, so jammed that it was impossible to pass, violent politicaldebates raged all night long. Occasionally the conductor camethrough, as a matter of habit, looking for tickets. He found very fewexcept ours, and after a half-hour of futile wrangling, lifted hisarms despairingly and withdrew. The atmosphere was stifling, full ofsmoke and foul odours; if it hadn't been for the broken windows wewould doubtless have smothered during the night.In the morning, hours late, we looked out upon a snowy world. It wasbitter cold. About noon a peasant woman got on with a basket-full ofbread-chunks and a great can of luke warm coffee-substitute. Fromthen on until dark there was nothing but the packed train, joltingand stopping, and occasional stations where a ravenous mob swoopeddown on the scantily-furnished buffet and swept it clean.... At one ofthese halts I ran into Nogin and Rykov, the seceding Commissars, whowere returning to Moscow to put their grievances before their ownSoviet,  1and further along was Bukharin, a short, red-bearded manwith the eyes of a fanatic-"more Left than Lenin," they said of him....Then the three strokes of the bell and we made a rush for the train,worming our way through the packed and noisy aisle.... A good-naturedcrowd, bearing the discomfort with humorous patience, interminablyarguing about everything from the situation in Petrograd to theBritish Trade-Union system, and disputing loudly with the few_boorzhui_ who were on board. Before we reached Moscow almost everycar had organised a Committee to secure and distribute food, andthese Committees became divided into political factions, who wrangledover fundamental principles....The station at Moscow was deserted. We went to the office of theCommissar, in order to arrange for our return tickets. He was asullen youth with the shoulder-straps of a Lieutenant; when we showedhim our papers from Smolny, he lost his temper and declared that hewas no Bolshevik, that he represented the Committee of PublicSafety.... It was characteristic-in the general turmoil attending theconquest of the city, the chief railway station had been forgotten bythe victors....Not a cab in sight. A few blocks down the street, however, we woke upa grotesquely-padded _izvostchik_ asleep upright on the box of hislittle sleigh. "How much to the centre of the town?"He scratched his head. "The _barini_ won't be able to find a room inany hotel," he said. "But I'll take you around for a hundredrubles...." Before the Revolution it cost _two!_ We objected, but hesimply shrugged his shoulders. "It takes a good deal of courage todrive a sleigh nowadays," he went on. We could not beat him downbelow fifty.... As we sped along the silent, snowy half-lightedstreets, he recounted his adventures during the six days' fighting."Driving along, or waiting for a fare on the corner," he said, "allof a sudden _pooff!_ a cannon ball exploding here, _pooff!_ a cannonball there, _ratt-ratt!_ a machine-gun.... I gallop, the devilsshooting all around. I get to a nice quiet street and stop, doze alittle, _pooff!_ another cannon ball, _ratt-ratt_.... Devils! Devils!Devils! Brrr!"In the centre of the town the snow-piled streets were quiet with thestillness of convalescence. Only a few arc-lights were burning, onlya few pedestrians hurried along the side-walks. An icy wind blew fromthe great plain, cutting to the bone. At the first hotel we enteredan office illuminated by two candles."Yes, we have some very comfortable rooms, but all the windows areshot out. If the _gospodin_ does not mind a little fresh air...."Down the Tverskaya the shop-windows were broken, and there wereshell-holes and torn-up paving stones in the street. Hotel afterhotel, all full, or the proprietors still so frightened that all theycould say was, "No, no, there is no room! There is no room!" On themain streets, where the great banking-houses and mercantile houseslay, the Bolshevik artillery had been indiscriminately effective. Asone Soviet official told me, "Whenever we didn't know just where the_yunkers_ and White Guards were, we bombarded their pocketbooks...."At the big Hotel National they finally took us in; for we wereforeigners, and the Military Revolutionary Committee had promised toprotect the dwellings of foreigners.... On the top floor the managershowed us where shrapnel had shattered several windows. "Theanimals!" said he, shaking his first at imaginary Bolsheviki. "Butwait! Their time will come; in just a few days now their ridiculousGovernment will fall, and then we shall make them suffer!"We dined at a vegetarian restaurant with the enticing name, "I EatNobody," and Tolstoy's picture prominent on the walls, and thensallied out into the streets.The headquarters of the Moscow Soviet was in the palace of the formerGovernor-General, an imposing white building fronting SkobelievSquare. Red Guards stood sentry at the door. At the head of the wide,formal stairway, whose walls were plastered with announcements ofcommittee-meetings and addresses of political parties, we passedthrough a series of lofty ante-rooms, hung with red-shrouded picturesin gold frames, to the splendid state salon, with its magnificentcrystal lustres and gilded cornices. A low-voiced hum of talk,underlaid with the whirring bass of a score of sewing machines,filled the place. Huge bolts of red and black cotton cloth wereunrolled, serpentining across the parqueted floor and over tables, atwhich sat half a hundred women, cutting and sewing streamers andbanners for the Funeral of the Revolutionary Dead. The faces of thesewomen were roughened and scarred with life at its most difficult;they worked now sternly, many of them with eyes red from weeping....The losses of the Red Army had been heavy.At a desk in one corner was Rogov, an intelligent, bearded man withglasses, wearing the black blouse of a worker. He invited us to marchwith the Central Executive Committee in the funeral procession nextmorning...."It is impossible to teach the Socialist Revolutionaries and theMensheviki anything!" he exclaimed. "They compromise from sheerhabit. Imagine! They proposed that we hold a joint funeral with the_yunkers!"_[Graphic page-251 Questionairre for the Bourgeoioisie]Distributed to all bourgeois households in Moscow by the MoscowMilitary Revolutionary Commitee, so as to provide a basis for therequisition of clothing for the Army and the poor workers. Fortranslation see Appendix 3. (See App. X, Sect. 3)Across the hall came a man in a ragged soldier-coat and _shapka,_whose face was familiar; I recognised Melnichansky, whom I had knownas the watch-maker George Melcher in Bayonne, New Jersey, during thegreat Standard Oil strike. Now, he told me, he was secretary of theMoscow Metal-Workers' Union, and a Commissar of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee during the fighting...."You see me!" he cried, showing his decrepit clothing. "I was withthe boys in the Kremlin when the _yunkers_ came the first time. Theyshut me up in the cellar and swiped my overcoat, my money, watch andeven the ring on my finger. This is all I've got to wear!"From him I learned many details of the bloody six-day battle whichhad rent Moscow in two. Unlike in Petrograd, in Moscow the City Dumahad taken command of the _yunkers_ and White Guards. Rudnev, theMayor, and Minor, president of the Duma, had directed the activitiesof the Committee of Public Safety and the troops. Riabtsev,Commandant of the city, a man of democratic instincts, had hesitatedabout opposing the Military Revolutionary Committee; but the Duma hadforced him.... It was the Mayor who had urged the occupation of theKremlin; "They will never dare fire on you there," he said....One garrison regiment, badly demoralised by long inactivity, had beenapproached by both sides. The regiment held a meeting to decide whataction to take. Resolved, that the regiment remain neutral, andcontinue its present activities-which consisted in peddling rubbersand sunflower seeds!"But worst of all," said Melnichansky, "we had to organise while wewere fighting. The other side knew just what it wanted; but here thesoldiers had their Soviet and the workers theirs.... There was afearful wrangle over who should be Commander-in-chief; some regimentstalked for days before they decided what to do; and when the officerssuddenly deserted us, we had no battle-staff to give orders...."Vivid little pictures he gave me. On a cold grey day he had stood ata corner of the Nikitskaya, which was swept by blasts of machine-gunfire. A throng of little boys were gathered there-street waifs whoused to be newsboys. Shrill, excited as if with a new game, theywaited until the firing slackened, and then tried to run across thestreet.... Many were killed, but the rest dashed backward and forward,laughing, daring each other....Late in the evening I went to the _Dvorianskoye Sobranie_-the Nobles'Club-where the Moscow Bolsheviki were to meet and consider the reportof Nogin, Rykov and the others who had left the Council of People'sCommissars.The meeting-place was a theatre, in which, under the old régime, toaudiences of officers and glittering ladies, amateur presentations ofthe latest French comedy had once taken place.At first the place filled with the intellectuals-those who lived nearthe centre of the town. Nogin spoke, and most of his listeners wereplainly with him. It was very late before the workers arrived; theworking-class quarters were on the outskirts of the town, and nostreet-cars were running. But about midnight they began to clump upthe stairs, in groups of ten or twenty-big, rough men, in coarseclothes, fresh from the battle-line, where they had fought likedevils for a week, seeing their comrades fall all about them.Scarcely had the meeting formally opened before Nogin was assailedwith a tempest of jeers and angry shouts. In vain he tried to argue,to explain; they would not listen. He had left the Council ofPeople's Commissars; he had deserted his post while the battle wasraging. As for the bourgeois press, here in Moscow there was no morebourgeois press; even the City Duma had been dissolved. (See App. X,Sect. 4) Bukharin stood up, savage, logical, with a voice whichplunged and struck, plunged and struck.... Him they listened to withshining eyes. Resolution, to support the action of the Council ofPeople's Commissars, passed by overwhelming majority. So spokeMoscow....[Graphic page-254 Pass to the Kremlin]By this the Military Revolutionary Commitee requests to give a passfor the purpose of investigating the Kremlin, the representatives ofthe American Socialist party attached to the Socialist press,comrades Reed and Bryant.              Chief of the Military Revolutionary Committee                              For the SecretaryLate in the night we went through the empty streets and under theIberian Gate to the great Red Square in front of the Kremlin. Thechurch of Vasili Blazheiny loomed fantastic, its bright-coloured,convoluted and blazoned cupolas vague in the darkness. There was nosign of any damage.... Along one side of the square the dark towers andwalls of the Kremlin stood up. On the high walls flickered redly thelight of hidden flames; voices reached us across the immense place,and the sound of picks and shovels. We crossed over.Mountains of dirt and rock were piled high near the base of the wall.Climbing these we looked down into two massive pits, ten or fifteenfeet deep and fifty yards long, where hundreds of soldiers andworkers were digging in the light of huge fires.A young student spoke to us in German. "The Brotherhood Grave," heexplained. "To-morrow we shall bury here five hundred proletarianswho died for the Revolution."He took us down into the pit. In frantic haste swung the picks andshovels, and the earth-mountains grew. No one spoke. Overhead thenight was thick with stars, and the ancient Imperial Kremlin walltowered up immeasurably."Here in this holy place," said the student, "holiest of all Russia,we shall bury our most holy. Here where are the tombs of the Tsars,our Tsar-the People-shall sleep...." His arm was in a sling, from abullet-wound gained in the fighting. He looked at it. "You foreignerslook down on us Russians because so long we tolerated a mediævalmonarchy," said he. "But we saw that the Tsar was not the only tyrantin the world; capitalism was worse, and in all the countries of theworld capitalism was Emperor.... Russian revolutionary tactics arebest...."As we left, the workers in the pit, exhausted and running with sweatin spite of the cold, began to climb wearily out. Across the RedSquare a dark knot of men came hurrying. They swarmed into the pits,picked up the tools and began digging, digging, without a word....So, all the long night volunteers of the People relieved each other,never halting in their driving speed, and the cold light of the dawnlaid bare the great Square, white with snow, and the yawning brownpits of the Brotherhood Grave, quite finished.We rose before sunrise, and hurried through the dark streets toSkobeliev Square. In all the great city not a human being could beseen; but there was a faint sound of stirring, far and near, like adeep wind coming. In the pale half-light a little group of men andwomen were gathered before the Soviet headquarters, with a sheaf ofgold-lettered red banners-the Central Executive Committee of theMoscow Soviets. It grew light. From afar the vague stirring sounddeepened and became louder, a steady and tremendous bass. The citywas rising. We set out down the Tverskaya, the banners flappingoverhead. The little street chapels along our way were locked anddark, as was the Chapel of the Iberian Virgin, which each new Tsarused to visit before he went to the Kremlin to crown himself, andwhich, day or night, was always open and crowded, and brilliant withthe candles of the devout gleaming on the gold and silver and jewelsof the ikons. Now, for the first time since Napoleon was in Moscow,they say, the candles were out.The Holy Orthodox Church had withdrawn the light of its countenancefrom Moscow, the nest of irreverent vipers who had bombarded theKremlin. Dark and silent and cold were the churches; the priests haddisappeared. There were no popes to officiate at the Red Burial,there had been no sacrament for the dead, nor were any prayers to besaid over the grave of the blasphemers. Tikhon, Metropolitan ofMoscow, was soon to excommunicate the Soviets....Also the shops were closed, and the propertied classes stayed athome-but for other reasons. This was the Day of the People, therumour of whose coming was thunderous as surf....Already through the Iberian Gate a human river was flowing, and thevast Red Square was spotted with people, thousands of them. Iremarked that as the throng passed the Iberian Chapel, where alwaysbefore the passerby had crossed himself, they did not seem to noticeit....We forced our way through the dense mass packed near the Kremlinwall, and stood upon one of the dirt-mountains. Already several menwere there, among them Muranov, the soldier who had been electedCommandant of Moscow-a tall, simple-looking, bearded man with agentle face.Through all the streets to the Red Square the torrents of peoplepoured, thousands upon thousands of them, all with the look of thepoor and the toiling. A military band came marching up, playing the_Internationale,_ and spontaneously the song caught and spread likewind-ripples on a sea, slow and solemn. From the top of the Kremlinwall gigantic banners unrolled to the ground; red, with great lettersin gold and in white, saying, "Martyrs of the Beginning of WorldSocial Revolution," and "Long Live the Brotherhood of Workers of theWorld."A bitter wind swept the Square, lifting the banners. Now from the farquarters of the city the workers of the different factories werearriving, with their dead. They could be seen coming through theGate, the blare of their banners, and the dull red-like blood-of thecoffins they carried. These were rude boxes, made of unplaned woodand daubed with crimson, borne high on the shoulders of rough men whomarched with tears streaming down their faces, and followed by womenwho sobbed and screamed, or walked stiffly, with white, dead faces.Some of the coffins were open, the lid carried behind them; otherswere covered with gilded or silvered cloth, or had a soldier's hatnailed on the top. There were many wreaths of hideous artificialflowers....Through an irregular lane that opened and closed again the processionslowly moved toward us. Now through the Gate was flowing an endlessstream of banners, all shades of red, with silver and gold lettering,knots of crepe hanging from the top-and some Anarchist flags, blackwith white letters. The band was playing the Revolutionary FuneralMarch, and against the immense singing of the mass of people,standing uncovered, the paraders sang hoarsely, choked with sobs....Between the factory-workers came companies of soldiers with theircoffins, too, and squadrons of cavalry, riding at salute, andartillery batteries, the cannon wound with red and black-forever, itseemed. Their banners said, "Long live the Third International!" or"We Want an Honest, General, Democratic Peace!"Slowly the marchers came with their coffins to the entrance of thegrave, and the bearers clambered up with their burdens and went downinto the pit. Many of them were women-squat, strong proletarianwomen. Behind the dead came other women-women young and broken, orold, wrinkled women making noises like hurt animals, who tried tofollow their sons and husbands into the Brotherhood Grave, andshrieked when compassionate hands restrained them. The poor love eachother so!All the long day the funeral procession passed, coming in by theIberian Gate and leaving the Square by way of the Nikolskaya, a riverof red banners, bearing words of hope and brotherhood and stupendousprophecies, against a back-ground of fifty thousand people,-under theeyes of the world's workers and their descendants forever....One by one the five hundred coffins were laid in the pits. Dusk fell,and still the banners came drooping and fluttering, the band playedthe Funeral March, and the huge assemblage chanted. In the leaflessbranches of the trees above the grave the wreaths were hung, likestrange, multi-coloured blossoms. Two hundred men began to shovel inthe dirt. It rained dully down upon the coffins with a thuddingsound, audible beneath the singing....The lights came out. The last banners passed, and the last moaningwomen, looking back with awful intensity as they went. Slowly fromthe great Square ebbed the proletarian tide....I suddenly realised that the devout Russian people no longer neededpriests to pray them into heaven. On earth they were building akingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer, and for which itwas a glory to die....                              Chapter XI                The Conquest of Power (See App. XI, Sect. 1)DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA (See App. XI,Sect. 2)... The first Congress of Soviets, in June of this year, proclaimedthe right of the peoples of Russia to self-determination.The second Congress of Soviets, in November last, confirmed thisinalienable right of the peoples of Russia more decisively anddefinitely.Executing the will of these Congresses, the Council of People'sCommissars has resolved to establish as a basis for its activity inthe question of Nationalities, the following principles:(1) The equality and sovereignty of the peoples of Russia.(2) The right of the peoples of Russia to free self-determination,even to the point of separation and the formation of an independentstate.(3) The abolition of any and all national and national religiousprivileges and disabilities.(4) The free development of national minorities and ethnographicgroups inhabiting the territory of Russia.Decrees will be prepared immediately upon the formation of aCommission on Nationalities.In the name of the Russian Republic,People's Commissar for NationalitiesYUSSOV DJUGASHVILI-STALINPresident of the Council of People's CommissarsV. ULIANOV (LENIN)The Central Rada at Kiev immediately declared Ukraine an independentRepublic, as did the Government of Finland, through the Senate atHelsingfors. Independent "Governments" spring up in Siberia and theCaucasus. The Polish Chief Military Committee swiftly gatheredtogether the Polish troops in the Russian army, abolished theirCommittees and established an iron discipline....All these "Governments" and "movements" had two characteristics incommon; they were controlled by the propertied classes, and theyfeared and detested Bolshevism....Steadily, amid the chaos of shocking change, the Council of People'sCommissars hammered at the scaffolding of the Socialist order.Decree on Social Insurance, on Workers' Control, Regulations forVolost Land Committees, Abolition of Ranks and Titles, Abolition ofCourts and the Creation of People's Tribunals.... (See App. XI, Sect.3)Army after army, fleet after fleet, sent deputations, "joyfully togreet the new Government of the People."In front of Smolny, one day, I saw a ragged regiment just come fromthe trenches. The soldiers were drawn up before the great gates,thin and grey-faced, looking up at the building as if God were init. Some pointed out the Imperial eagles over the door, laughing....Red Guards came to mount guard. All the soldiers turned to look,curiously, as if they had heard of them but never seen them. Theylaughed good-naturedly and pressed out of line to slap the RedGuards on the back, with half-joking, half-admiring remarks....The Provisional Government was no more. On November 15th, in all thechurches of the capital, the priests stopped praying for it. But asLenin himself told the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ that was "only the beginningof the conquest of power." Deprived of arms, the opposition, whichstill controlled the economic life of the country, settled down toorganise disorganisation, with all the Russian genius forcooperative action-to obstruct, cripple and discredit the Soviets.The strike of Government employees was well organised, financed bythe banks and commercial establishments. Every move of theBolsheviki to take over the Government apparatus was resisted.Trotzky went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the functionariesrefused to recognise him, locked themselves in, and when the doorswere forced, resigned. He demanded the keys of the archives; onlywhen he brought workmen to force the locks were they given up. Thenit was discovered that Neratov, former assistant Foreign Minister,had disappeared with the Secret Treaties....Shliapnikov tried to take possession of the Ministry of Labour. Itwas bitterly cold, and there was no one to light the fires. Of allthe hundreds of employees, not one would show him where the officeof the Minister was....Alexandra Kollontai, appointed the 13th of November Commissar ofPublic Welfare-the department of charities and publicinstitutions-was welcomed with a strike of all but forty of thefunctionaries in the Ministry. Immediately the poor of the greatcities, the inmates of institutions, were plunged in miserable want:delegations of starving cripples, of orphans with blue, pinchedfaces, besieged the building. With tears streaming down her face,Kollontai arrested the strikers until they should deliver the keysof the office and the safe; when she got the keys, however, it wasdiscovered that the former Minister, Countess Panina, had gone offwith all the funds, which she refused to surrender except on theorder of the Constituent Assembly. (See App. XI, Sect. 4)In the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Supplies, theMinistry of Finance, similar incidents occurred. And the employees,summoned to return or forfeit their positions and their pensions,either stayed away or returned to sabotage.... Almost all the_intelligentzia_ being anti-Bolshevik, there was nowhere for theSoviet Government to recruit new staffs....The private banks remained stubbornly closed, with a back door openfor speculators. When Bolshevik Commissars entered, the clerks left,secreting the books and removing the funds. All the employees of theState Bank struck except the clerks in charge of the vaults and themanufacture of money, who refused all demands from Smolny andprivately paid out huge sums to the Committee for Salvation and theCity Duma.Twice a Commissar, with a company of Red Guards, came formally toinsist upon the delivery of large sums for Government expenses. Thefirst time, the City Duma members and the Menshevik and SocialistRevolutionary leaders were present in imposing numbers, and spoke sogravely of the consequences that the Commissar was frightened. Thesecond time he arrived with a warrant, which he proceeded to readaloud in due form; but some one called his attention to the factthat it had no date and no seal, and the traditional Russian respectfor "documents" forced him again to withdraw....The officials of the Credit Chancery destroyed their books, so thatall record of the financial relations of Russia with foreigncountries was lost.The Supply Committees, the administrations of the Municipal-ownedpublic utilities, either did not work at all, or sabotaged. And whenthe Bolsheviki, compelled by the desperate needs of the citypopulation, attempted to help or to control the public service, allthe employees went on strike immediately, and the Duma floodedRussia with telegrams about Bolshevik "violation of Municipalautonomy."At Military headquarters, and in the offices of the Ministries ofWar and Marine, where the old officials had consented to work, theArmy Committees and the high command blocked the Soviets in everyway possible, even to the extent of neglecting the troops at thefront. The _Vikzhel_ was hostile, refusing to transport Soviettroops; every troop-train that left Petrograd was taken out byforce, and railway officials had to be arrested each time-whereuponthe _Vikzhel_ threatened an immediate general strike unless theywere released....Smolny was plainly powerless. The newspapers said that all thefactories of Petrograd must shut down for lack of fuel in threeweeks; the _Vikzhel_ announced that trains must cease running byDecember first; there was food for three days only in Petrograd, andno more coming in; and the Army on the Front was starving.... TheCommittee for Salvation, the various Central Committees, sent wordall over the country, exhorting the population to ignore theGovernment decrees. And the Allied Embassies were either coldlyindifferent, or openly hostile....The opposition newspapers, suppressed one day and reappearing nextmorning under new names, heaped bitter sarcasm on the new regime.(See App. XI, Sect. 5) Even _Novaya Zhizn_ characterised it as "acombination of demagoguery and impotence."From day to day (it said) the Government of the People's Commissarssinks deeper and deeper into the mire of superficial haste. Havingeasily conquered the power... the Bolsheviki can not make use of it.Powerless to direct the existing mechanism of Government, they areunable at the same time to create a new one which might work easilyand freely according to the theories of social experimenters.Just a little while ago the Bolsheviki hadn't enough men to runtheir growing party-a work above all of speakers and writers; wherethen are they going to find trained men to execute the diverse andcomplicated functions of government?The new Government acts and threatens, it sprays the country withdecrees, each one more radical and more "socialist" than the last.But in this exhibition of Socialism on Paper-more likely designedfor the stupefaction of our descendants-there appears neither thedesire nor the capacity to solve the immediate problems of the day!Meanwhile the _Vikzhel's_ Conference to Form a New Governmentcontinued to meet night and day. Both sides had already agreed inprinciple to the basis of the Government; the composition of thePeople's Council was being discussed; the Cabinet was tentativelychosen, with Tchernov as Premier; the Bolsheviki were admitted in alarge minority, but Lenin and Trotzky were barred. The CentralCommittees of the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary parties, theExecutive Committee of the Peasant's Soviets, resolved that,although unalterably opposed to the "criminal politics" of theBolsheviki, they would, "in order to halt the fratricidalbloodshed," not oppose their entrance into the People's Council.The flight of Kerensky, however, and the astounding success of theSoviets everywhere, altered the situation. On the 16th, in a meetingof the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the Left Socialist Revolutionaries insistedthat the Bolsheviki should form a coalition Government with theother Socialist parties; otherwise they would withdraw from theMilitary Revolutionary Committee and the _Tsay-ee-kah._ Malkin said,"The news from Moscow, where our comrades are dying on both sides ofthe barricades, determines us to bring up once more the question oforganisation of power, and it is not only our right to do so, butour duty.... We have won the right to sit with the Bolsheviki herewithin the walls of Smolny Institute, and to speak from thistribune. After the bitter internal party struggle, we shall beobliged, if you refuse to compromise, to pass to open battleoutside.... We must propose to the democracy terms of an acceptablecompromise...."After a recess to consider this ultimatum, the Bolsheviki returnedwith a resolution, read by Kameniev:The _Tsay-ee-kah_ considers it necessary that there enter into theGovernment representatives of _all the Socialist parties composingthe Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies whorecognise the conquests of the Revolution of November 7th-that is tosay, the establishment of a Government of Soviets, the decrees onpeace, land, workers' control over industry, and the arming of theworking-class._ The _Tsay-ee-kah_ therefore resolves to proposenegotiations concerning the constitution of the Government to allparties _of the Soviet,_ and insists upon the following conditionsas a basis:The Government is responsible to the _Tsay-ee-kah._ The_Tsay-ee-kah_ shall be enlarged to 150 members. To these 150delegates of the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies shall beadded 75 delegates of the _Provincial_ Soviets of Peasants'Deputies, 80 from the Front organisations of the Army and Navy, 40from the Trade Unions (25 from the various All-Russian Unions, inproportion to their importance, 10 from the _Vikzhel,_ and 5 fromthe Post and Telegraph Workers), and 50 delegates from the Socialistgroups in the Petrograd City Duma. In the Ministry itself, at leastone-half the portfolios must be reserved to the Bolsheviki. TheMinistries of Labour, Interior and Foreign Affairs must be given tothe Bolsheviki. The command of the garrisons of Petrograd and Moscowmust remain in the hands of delegates of the Moscow and PetrogradSoviets.The Government undertakes the systematic arming of the workers ofall Russia.It is resolved to insist upon the candidature of comrades Lenin andTrotzky.Kameniev explained. "The so-called 'People's Council,'" he said,"proposed by the Conference, would consist of about 420 members, ofwhich about 150 would be Bolsheviki. Besides, there would bedelegates from the counter-revolutionary old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ 100members chosen by the Municipal Dumas-Kornilovtsi all; 100 delegatesfrom the Peasants' Soviets-appointed by Avksentiev, and 80 from theold Army Committees, who no longer represent the soldier masses."We refuse to admit the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and also therepresentatives of the Municipal Dumas. The delegates from thePeasants' Soviets shall be elected by the Congress of Peasants,which we have called, and which will at the same time elect a newExecutive Committee. The proposal to exclude Lenin and Trotzky is aproposal to decapitate our party, and we do not accept it. Andfinally, we see no necessity for a 'People's Council' anyway; theSoviets are open to all Socialist parties, and the _Tsay-ee-kah_represents them in their real proportions among the masses...."Karelin, for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, declared that hisparty would vote for the Bolshevik resolution, reserving the rightto modify certain details, such as the representation of thepeasants, and demanding that the Ministry of Agriculture be reservedfor the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. This was agreed to....Later, at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, Trotzky answered aquestion about the formation of the new Government:"I don't know anything about that. I am not taking part in thenegotiations.... However, I don't think that they are of greatimportance...."That night there was great uneasiness in the Conference. Thedelegates of the City Duma withdrew....But at Smolny itself, in the ranks of the Bolshevik party, aformidable opposition to Lenin's policy was growing. On the night ofNovember 17th the great hall was packed and ominous for the meetingof the _Tsay-ee-kah._Larin, Bolshevik, declared that the moment of elections to theConstituent Assembly approached, and it was time to do away with"political terrorism.""The measures taken against the freedom of the press should bemodified. They had their reason during the struggle, but now theyhave no further excuse. The press should be free, except for appealsto riot and insurrection."In a storm of hisses and hoots from his own party, Larin offered thefollowing resolution:The decree of the Council of People's Commissars concerning thePress is herewith repealed.Measures of political repression can only be employed subject todecision of a special tribunal, elected by the _Tsay-ee-kah_proportionally to the strength of the different parties represented;and this tribunal shall have the right also to reconsider measuresof repression already taken.This was met by a thunder of applause, not only from the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries, but also from a part of the Bolsheviki.Avanessov, for the Leninites, hastily proposed that the question ofthe Press be postponed until after some compromise between theSocialist parties had been reached. Overwhelmingly voted down."The revolution which is now being accomplished," went on Avanessov,"has not hesitated to attack private property; and it is as privateproperty that we must examine the question of the Press...."Thereupon he read the official Bolshevik resolution:The suppression of the bourgeois press was dictated not only bypurely military needs in the course of the insurrection, and for thechecking of counter-revolutionary action, but it is also necessaryas a measure of transition toward the establishment of a new régimewith regard to the Press-a régime under which the capitalist ownersof printing-presses and of paper cannot be the all-powerful andexclusive manufacturers of public opinion.We must further proceed to the confiscation of private printingplants and supplies of paper, which should become the property ofthe Soviets, both in the capital and in the provinces, so that thepolitical parties and groups can make use of the facilities ofprinting in proportion to the actual strength of the ideas theyrepresent-in other words, proportionally to the number of theirconstituents.The reëstablishment of the so-called "freedom of the press," thesimple return of printing presses and paper to thecapitalists,-poisoners of the mind of the people-this would be aninadmissible surrender to the will of capital, a giving up of one ofthe most important conquests of the Revolution; in other words, itwould be a measure of unquestionably counter-revolutionary character.Proceeding from the above, the _Tsay-ee-kah_ categorically rejectsall propositions aiming at the reëstablishment of the old régime inthe domain of the Press, and unequivocally supports the point ofview of the Council of People's Commissars on this question, againstpretentions and ultimatums dictated by petty bourgeois prejudices,or by evident surrender to the interests of thecounter-revolutionary bourgeoisie.The reading of this resolution was interrupted by ironical shoutsfrom the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, and bursts of indignationfrom the insurgent Bolsheviki. Karelin was on his feet, protesting."Three weeks ago the Bolsheviki were the most ardent defenders ofthe freedom of the Press... The arguments in this resolution suggestsingularly the point of view of the old Black Hundreds and thecensors of the Tsarist régime-for they also talked of 'poisoners ofthe mind of the people.'"Trotzky spoke at length in favour of the resolution. Hedistinguished between the Press during the civil war, and the Pressafter the victory. "During civil war the right to use violencebelongs only to the oppressed...." (Cries of "Who's the oppressed now?Cannibal!")."The victory over our adversaries is not yet achieved, and thenewspapers are arms in their hands. In these conditions, the closingof the newspapers is a legitimate measure of defence...." Then passingto the question of the Press after the victory, Trotzky continued:"The attitude of Socialists on the question of freedom of the Pressshould be the same as their attitude toward the freedom ofbusiness.... The rule of the democracy which is being established inRussia demands that the domination of the Press by private propertymust be abolished, just as the domination of industry by privateproperty.... The power of the Soviets should confiscate allprinting-plants." (Cries, "Confiscate the printing-shop of_Pravda!_")"The monopoly of the Press by the bourgeoisie must be abolished.Otherwise it isn't worth while for us to take the power! Each groupof citizens should have access to print shops and paper.... Theownership of print-type and of paper belongs first to the workersand peasants, and only afterwards to the bourgeois parties, whichare in a minority.... The passing of the power into the hands of theSoviets will bring about a radical transformation of the essentialconditions of existence, and this transformation will necessarily beevident in the Press.... If we are going to nationalise the banks, canwe then tolerate the financial journals? The old régime must die;that must be understood once and for all...." Applause and angry cries.Karelin declared that the _Tsay-ee-kah_ had no right to pass uponthis important question, which should be left to a specialcommittee. Again, passionately, he demanded that the Press be free.Then Lenin, calm, unemotional, his forehead wrinkled, as he spokeslowly, choosing his words; each sentence falling like ahammer-blow. "The civil war is not yet finished; the enemy is stillwith us; consequently it is impossible to abolish the measures ofrepression against the Press."We Bolsheviki have always said that when we reached a position ofpower we would close the bourgeois press. To tolerate the bourgeoisnewspapers would mean to cease being a Socialist. When one makes aRevolution, one cannot mark time; one must always go forward-or goback. He who now talks about the 'freedom of the Press' goesbackward, and halts our headlong course toward Socialism."We have thrown off the yoke of capitalism, just as the firstrevolution threw off the yoke of Tsarism. _If the first revolutionhad the right to suppress the Monarchist papers,_ then we have theright to suppress the bourgeois press. It is impossible to separatethe question of the freedom of the Press from the other questions ofthe class struggle. We have promised to close these newspapers, andwe shall do it. The immense majority of the people is with us!"Now that the insurrection is over, we have absolutely no desire tosuppress the papers of the other Socialist parties, except inasmuchas they appeal to armed insurrection, or to disobedience to theSoviet Government. However, we shall not permit them, under thepretence of freedom of the Socialist press, to obtain, through thesecret support of the bourgeoisie, a monopoly of printing-presses,ink and paper.... These essentials must become the property of theSoviet Government, and be apportioned, first of all, to theSocialist parties in strict proportion to their voting strength...."Then the vote. The resolution of Larin and the Left SocialistRevolutionaries was defeated by 31 to 22; the Lenin motion wascarried by 34 to 24. Among the minority were the Bolsheviki Riazanovand Lozovsky, who declared that it was impossible for them to voteagainst any restriction on the freedom of the Press.Upon this the Left Socialist Revolutionaries declared they could nolonger be responsible for what was being done, and withdrew from theMilitary Revolutionary Committee and all other positions ofexecutive responsibility.Five members-Nogin, Rykov, Miliutin, Teodorovitch andShiapnikov-resigned from the Council of People's Commissars,declaring:We are in favour of a Socialist Government composed of all theparties in the Soviets. We consider that only the creation of such aGovernment can possibly guarantee the results of the heroic struggleof the working-class and the revolutionary army. Outside of that,there remains only one way: the constitution of a purely BolshevikGovernment by means of political terrorism. This last is the roadtaken by the Council of People's Commissars. We cannot and will notfollow it. We see that this leads directly to the elimination frompolitical life of many proletarian organisations, to theestablishment of an irresponsible régime, and to the destruction ofthe Revolution and the country. We cannot take the responsibilityfor such a policy, and we renounce before the _Tsay-ee-kah_ ourfunction as People's Commissars.Other Commissars, without resigning their positions, signed thedeclaration-Riazanov, Derbychev of the Press Department, Arbuzov, ofthe Government Printing-plant, Yureniev, of the Red Guard, Feodorov,of the Commissariat of Labour, and Larin, secretary of the Sectionof Elaboration of Decrees.At the same time Kameniev, Rykov, Miliutin, Zinoviev and Noginresigned from the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party, makingpublic their reasons:... The constitution of such a Government (composed of all the partiesof the Soviet) is indispensable to prevent a new flow of blood, thecoming famine, the destruction of the Revolution by the Kaledinists,to assure the convocation of the Constituent Assembly at the propertime, and to apply effectively the programme adopted by the Congressof Soviets....We cannot accept the responsibility for the disastrous policy of theCentral Committee, carried on against the will of an enormousmajority of the proletariat and the soldiers, who are eager to seethe rapid end of the bloodshed between the different politicalparties of the democracy.... We renounce our title as members of theCentral Committee, in order to be able to say openly our opinion tothe masses of workers and soldiers....We leave the Central Committee at the moment of victory; we cannotcalmly look on while the policy of the chiefs of the CentralCommittee leads toward the loss of the fruits of victory and thecrushing of the proletariat....The masses of the workers, the soldiers of the garrison, stirredrestlessly, sending their delegations to Smolny, to the Conferencefor Formation of the New Government, where the break in the ranks ofthe Bolsheviki caused the liveliest joy.But the answer of the Leninites was swift and ruthless. Shliapnikovand Teodorovitch submitted to party discipline and returned to theirposts. Kameniev was stripped of his powers as president of the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ and Sverdlov elected in his place. Zinoviev wasdeposed as president of the Petrograd Soviet. On the morning of the5th, _Pravda_ contained a ferocious proclamation to the people ofRussia, written by Lenin, which was printed in hundreds of thousandsof copies, posted on the walls everywhere, and distributed over theface of Russia.The second All-Russian Congress of Soviets gave the majority to theBolshevik party. Only a Government formed by this party cantherefore be a Soviet Government. And it is known to all that theCentral Committee of the Bolshevik party, a few hours before theformation of the new Government and before proposing the list of itsmembers to the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, invited to itsmeeting three of the most eminent members of the Left SocialistRevolutionary group, comrades Kamkov, Spiro and Karelin, and ASKEDTHEM to participate in the new Government. We regret infinitely thatthe invited comrades refused; we consider their refusal inadmissiblefor revolutionists and champions of the working-class; we arewilling at any time to include the Left Socialist Revolutionaries inthe Government; but we declare that, as the party of the majority atthe second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, we are entitled andBOUND before the people to form a Government....... Comrades! Several members of the Central Committee of our partyand the Council of People's Commissars, Kameniev, Zinoviev, Nogin,Rykov, Miliutin and a few others left yesterday, November 17th, theCentral Committee of our party, and the last three, the Council ofPeople's Commissars....The comrades who left us acted like deserters, because they not onlyabandoned the posts entrusted to them, but also disobeyed the directinstructions of the Central Committee of our party, to the effectthat they should await the decisions of the Petrograd and Moscowparty organisations before retiring. We blame decisively suchdesertion. We are firmly convinced that all conscious workers,soldiers and peasants, belonging to our party or sympathising withit, will also disapprove of the behaviour of the deserters....Remember, comrades, that two of these deserters, Kameniev andZinoviev, even before the uprising in Petrograd, appeared asdeserters and strike-breakers, by voting at the decisive meeting ofthe Central Committee, October 23d, 1917, against the insurrection;and even AFTER the resolution passed by the Central Committee, theycontinued their campaign at a meeting of the party workers.... But thegreat impulse of the masses, the great heroism of millions ofworkers, soldiers and peasants, in Moscow, Petrograd, at the front,in the trenches, in the villages, pushed aside the deserters as arailway train scatters saw-dust....Shame upon those who are of little faith, hesitate, who doubt, whoallow themselves to be frightened by the bourgeoisie, or who succumbbefore the cries of the latter's direct or indirect accomplices!There is NOT A SHADOW of hesitation in the MASSES of Petrograd,Moscow, and the rest of Russia....... We shall not submit to any ultimatums from small groups ofintellectuals which are not followed by the masses, which arePRACTICALLY only supported by Kornilovists, Savinkovists, _yunkers,_and so forth....The response from the whole country was like a blast of hot storm.The insurgents never got a chance to "say openly their opinion tothe masses of workers and soldiers." Upon the _Tsay-ee-kah_ rolledin like breakers the fierce popular condemnation of the "deserters."For days Smolny was thronged with angry delegations and committees,from the front, from the Volga, from the Petrograd factories. "Whydid they dare leave the Government? Were they paid by thebourgeoisie to destroy the Revolution? They must return and submitto the decisions of the Central Committee!"Only in the Petrograd garrison was there still uncertainty. A greatsoldier meeting was held on November 24th, addressed byrepresentatives of all the political parties. By a vast majorityLenin's policy was sustained, and the Left Socialist Revolutionarieswere told that they must enter the government.... _See next page._The Mensheviki delivered a final ultimatum, demanding that allMinisters and _yunkers_ be released, that all newspapers be allowedfull freedom, that the Red Guard be disarmed and the garrison putunder command of the Duma. To this Smolny answered that all theSocialist Ministers and also all but a very few _yunkers_ had beenalready set free, that all newspapers were free except the bourgeoispress, and that the Soviet would remain in command of the armedforces.... On the 19th the Conference to Form a New Governmentdisbanded, and the opposition one by one slipped away to Moghilev,where, under the wing of the General Staff, they continued to formGovernment after Government, until the end....[Graphic  Page-276 Meeting announcement]Announcement, posted on the walls of Petrograd, of the result of ameeting of representatives of the garrison regiments, called toconsider the question of forming a new Government. For translationsee App. XI, Sect. 6.Meanwhile the Bolsheviki had been undermining the power of the_Vikzhel._ An appeal of the Petrograd Soviet to all railway workerscalled upon them to force the _Vikzhel_ to surrender its powers. Onthe 15th, the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ following its procedure toward thepeasants, called an All-Russian Congress of Railway Workers forDecember 1st; the _Vikzhel_ immediately called its own Congress fortwo weeks later. On November 16th, the _Vikzhel_ members took theirseats in the _Tsay-ee-kah._ On the night of December 2d, at theopening session of the All-Russian Congress of Railway Workers, the_Tsay-ee-kah_ formally offered the post of Commissar of Ways andCommunications to the _Vikzhel_-which accepted....Having settled the question of power, the Bolsheviki turned theirattention to problems of practical administration. First of all thecity, the country, the Army must be fed. Bands of sailors and RedGuards scoured the warehouses, the railway terminals, even thebarges in the canals, unearthing and confiscating thousands of_poods_  1 of food held by private speculators. Emissaries were sentto the provinces, where with the assistance of the Land Committeesthey seized the store-houses of the great grain-dealers. Expeditionsof sailors, heavily armed, were sent out in groups of five thousand,to the South, to Siberia, with roving commissions to capture citiesstill held by the White Guards, establish order, and _get food._Passenger traffic on the Trans-Siberian Railroad was suspended fortwo weeks, while thirteen trains, loaded with bolts of cloth andbars of iron assembled by the Factory-Shop Committees, were sent outeastward, each in charge of a Commissar, to barter with the Siberianpeasants for grain and potatoes....Kaledin being in possession of the coal-mines of the Don, the fuelquestion became urgent. Smolny shut off all electric lights intheatres, shops and restaurants, cut down the number of street cars,and confiscated the private stores of fire-wood held by thefuel-dealers.... And when the factories of Petrograd were about toclose down for lack of coal, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet turnedover to the workers two hundred thousand _poods_ from the bunkers ofbattle-ships....Toward the end of November occurred the "wine-pogroms" (See App. XI,Sect. 7)-looting of the wine-cellars-beginning with the plunderingof the Winter Palace vaults. For days there were drunken soldiers onthe streets.... In all this was evident the hand of thecounter-revolutionists, who distributed among the regiments plansshowing the location of the stores of liquor. The Commissars ofSmolny began by pleading and arguing, which did not stop the growingdisorder, followed by pitched battles between soldiers and RedGuards.... Finally the Military Revolutionary Committee sent outcompanies of sailors with machine-guns, who fired mercilessly uponthe rioters, killing many; and by executive order the wine-cellarswere invaded by Committees with hatchets, who smashed the bottles-orblew them up with dynamite....Companies of Red Guards, disciplined and well-paid, were on duty atthe headquarters of the Ward Soviets day and night, replacing theold Militia. In all quarters of the city small electiveRevolutionary Tribunals were set up by the workers and soldiers todeal with petty crime....The great hotels, where the speculators still did a thrivingbusiness, were surrounded by Red Guards, and the speculators throwninto jail. (See App. XI, Sect. 8)...Alert and suspicious, the working-class of the city constituteditself a vast spy system, through the servants prying into bourgeoishouseholds, and reporting all information to the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee, which struck with an iron hand, unceasing.In this way was discovered the Monarchist plot led by formerDuma-member Purishkevitch and a group of nobles and officers, whohad planned an officers' uprising, and had written a letter invitingKaledin to Petrograd. (See App. XI, Sect. 9).... In this way wasunearthed the conspiracy of the Petrograd Cadets, who were sendingmoney and recruits to Kaledin....Neratov, frightened at the outburst of popular fury provoked by hisflight, returned and surrendered the Secret Treaties to Trotzky, whobegan their publication in _Pravda,_ scandalising the world....[Graphic Page-279 Proclamation ]Bolshevik order. A proclamation of the Committee to Fight againstPogroms, attached to the Petrograd Soviet. For translation seeApp. XI, Sect. 11.The restrictions on the Press were increased by a decree (See App.XI, Sect. 10) making advertisements a monopoly of the officialGovernment newspaper. At this all the other papers suspendedpublication as a protest, or disobeyed the law and were closed....Only three weeks later did they finally submit.Still the strike of the Ministries went on, still the sabotage ofthe old officials, the stoppage of normal economic life. BehindSmolny was only the will of the vast, unorganised popular masses;and with them the Council of People's Commissars dealt, directingrevolutionary mass-action against its enemies. In eloquentproclamations, (See App. XI, Sect. 12) couched in simple words andspread over Russia, Lenin explained the Revolution, urged the peopleto take the power into their own hands, by force to break down theresistance of the propertied classes, by force to take over theinstitutions of Government. Revolutionary order. Revolutionarydiscipline! Strict accounting and control! No strikes! No loafing![Graphic Page-281 Appeal to work hard ]Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet, the Petrograd Council ofProfessional Unions, and the Petrograd Council of Factory ShopCommittees, to the Workers of Petro. grad, urging them to work hardand not to strike. For translation see App. XI, Sect. 13.On the 20th of November the Military Revolutionary Committee issueda warning:The rich classes oppose the power of the Soviets-the Government ofworkers, soldiers and peasants. Their sympathisers halt the work ofthe employees of the Government and the Duma, incite strikes in thebanks, try to interrupt communication by the railways, the post andthe telegraph....We warn them that they are playing with fire. The country and theArmy are threatened with famine. To fight against it, the regularfunctioning of all services is indispensable. The Workers' andPeasants' Government is taking every measure to assure the countryand the Army all that is necessary. Opposition to these measures isa crime against the People. We warn the rich classes and theirsympathisers that, if they do not cease their sabotage and theirprovocation in halting the transportation of food, they will be thefirst to suffer. They will be deprived of the right of receivingfood. All the reserves which they possess will be requisitioned. Theproperty of the principal criminals will be confiscated.We have done our duty in warning those who play with fire.We are convinced that in case decisive measures become necessary, weshall be solidly supported by all workers, soldiers, and peasants.On the 22d of November the walls of the city were placarded with asheet headed "EXTRAORDINARY COMMUNICATION":The Council of People's Commissars has received an urgent telegramfrom the Staff of the Northern Front...."There must be no further delay; do not let the Army die of hunger;the armies of the Northern Front have not received a crust of breadnow for several days, and in two or three days they will not haveany more biscuits-which are being doled out to them from reservesupplies until now never touched.... Already delegates from all partsof the Front are talking of a necessary removal of part of the Armyto the rear, foreseeing that in a few days there will be headlongflight of the soldiers, dying from hunger, ravaged by the threeyears' war in the trenches, sick, insufficiently clothed,bare-footed, driven mad by superhuman misery."The Military Revolutionary Committee brings this to the notice ofthe Petrograd garrison and the workers of Petrograd. The situationat the Front demands the most urgent and decisive measures. ...Meanwhile the higher functionaries of the Government institutions,banks, railroads, post and telegraph, are on strike and impeding thework of the Government in supplying the Front with provisions.... Eachhour of delay may cost the life of thousands of soldiers. Thecounter-revolutionary functionaries are the most dishonest criminalstoward their hungry and dying brethren on the Front....The MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE GIVES THESE CRIMINALS A LASTWARNING. In event of the least resistance or opposition on theirpart, the harshness of the measures which will be adopted againstthem will correspond to the seriousness of their crime....------------------+----------+The masses of workers and soldiers responded by a savage tremor ofrage, which swept all Russia. In the capital the Government and bankemployees got out hundreds of proclamations and appeals (See App.XI, Sect. 14), protesting, defending themselves, such as this one:TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL CITIZENS.THE STATE BANK IS CLOSED!WHY?Because the violence exercised by the Bolsheviki against the StateBank has made it impossible for us to work. The first act of thePeople's Commissars was to DEMAND TEN MILLION RUBLES, and onNovember 27th THEY DEMANDED TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS, without anyindication as to where this money was to go.... We functionaries cannot take part in plundering the people'sproperty. We stopped work.CITIZENS! The money in the State Bank is yours, the people's money,acquired by your labour, your sweat and blood. CITIZENS! Save thepeople's property from robbery, and us from violence, and we shallimmediately resume work.EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE BANK.From the Ministry of Supplies, the Ministry of Finance, from theSpecial Supply Committee, declarations that the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee made it impossible for the employees towork, appeals to the population to support them against Smolny.... Butthe dominant worker and soldier did not believe them; it was firmlyfixed in the popular mind that the employees were sabotaging,starving the Army, starving the people.... In the long bread lines,which as formerly stood in the iron winter streets, it was not _theGovernment_ which was blamed, as it had been under Kerensky, but the_tchinovniki,_ the sabotageurs; for the Government was _their_Government, _their_ Soviets-and the functionaries of the Ministrieswere against it....At the centre of all this opposition was the Duma, and its militantorgan, the Committee for Salvation, protesting against all thedecrees of the Council of People's Commissars, voting again andagain not to recognise the Soviet Government, openly cooperatingwith the new counter-revolutionary "Governments" set up atMoghilev.... On the 17th of November, for example, the Committee forSalvation addressed "all Municipal Governments, Zemstvos, and alldemocratic and revolutionary organisations of peasants, workers,soldiers and other citizens," in these words:Do not recognise the Government of the Bolsheviki, and struggleagainst it.Form local Committees for Salvation of Country and Revolution, whowill unite all democratic forces, so as to aid the All-RussianCommittee for Salvation in the tasks which it has set itself....Meanwhile the elections for the Constituent Assembly in Petrograd(See App. XI, Sect. 15) gave an enormous plurality to theBolsheviki; so that even the Mensheviki Internationalists pointedout that the Duma ought to be re-elected, as it no longerrepresented the political composition of the Petrograd population....At the same time floods of resolutions from workers' organisations,from military units, even from the peasants in the surroundingcountry, poured in upon the Duma, calling it "counter-revolutionary,Kornilovitz," and demanding that it resign. The last days of theDuma were stormy with the bitter demands of the Municipal workersfor decent living wages, and the threat of strikes....On the 23d a formal decree of the Military Revolutionary Committeedissolved the Committee for Salvation. On the 29th, the Council ofPeople's Commissars ordered the dissolution and re-election of thePetrograd City Duma:In view of the fact that the Central Duma of Petrograd, electedSeptember 2d, ... has definitely lost the right to represent thepopulation of Petrograd, being in complete disaccord with its stateof mind and its aspirations ... and in view of the fact that thepersonnel of the Duma majority, although having lost all politicalfollowing, continues to make use of its prerogatives to resist in acounter-revolutionary manner the will of the workers, soldiers andpeasants, to sabotage and obstruct the normal work of theGovernment-the Council of People's Commissars considers it its dutyto invite the population of the capital to pronounce judgment on thepolicy of the organ of Municipal autonomy.To this end the Council of People's Commissars resolves:(1) To dissolve the Municipal Duma; the dissolution to take effectNovember 30th, 1917.(2) All functionaries elected or appointed by the present Duma shallremain at their posts and fulfil the duties confided to them, untiltheir places shall be filled by representatives of the new Duma.(3) All Municipal employees shall continue to fulfil their duties;those who leave the service of their own accord shall be considereddischarged.(4) The new elections for the Municipal Duma of Petrograd are fixedfor December 9th, 1917....(5) The Municipal Duma of Petrograd shall meet December 11th, 1917,at two o'clock.(6) Those who disobey this decree, as well as those whointentionally harm or destroy the property of the Municipality,shall be immediately arrested and brought before the RevolutionaryTribunals....The Duma met defiantly, passing resolutions to the effect that itwould "defend its position to the last drop of its blood," andappealing desperately to the population to save their "own electedCity Government." But the population remained indifferent orhostile. On the 31st Mayor Schreider and several members werearrested, interrogated, and released. That day and the next the Dumacontinued to meet, interrupted frequently by Red Guards and sailors,who politely requested the assembly to disperse. At the meeting ofDecember 2d, an officer and some sailors entered the Nicolai Hallwhile a member was speaking, and ordered the members to leave, orforce would be used. They did so, protesting to the last, butfinally "ceding to violence."The new Duma, which was elected ten days later, and for which the"Moderate" Socialists refused to vote, was almost entirelyBolshevik....There remained several centres of dangerous opposition, such as the"republics" of Ukraine and Finland, which were showing definitelyanti-Soviet tendencies. Both at Helsingfors and at Kiev theGovernments were gathering troops which could be depended upon, andentering upon campaigns of crushing Bolshevism, and of disarming andexpelling Russian troops. The Ukrainean Rada had taken command ofall southern Russia, and was furnishing Kaledin reinforcements andsupplies. Both Finland and Ukraine were beginning secretnegotiations with the Germans, and were promptly recognised by theAllied Governments, which loaned them huge sums of money, joiningwith the propertied classes to create counter-revolutionary centresof attack upon Soviet Russia. In the end, when Bolshevism hadconquered in both these countries, the defeated bourgeoisie calledin the Germans to restore them to power....But the most formidable menace to the Soviet Government was internaland two-headed-the Kaledin movement, and the Staff at Moghilev,where General Dukhonin had assumed command.Graphic Page-287 Education Proclamation]Proclamation of the Commission of Public Education attached to theCity Duma, concerning the strike of school-teachers, just before theChristmas holidays. The Duma had been re-elected, and was composedalmost entirely of Bolsheviki. For translation see App. XI, Sect. 17.The ubiquitous Muraviov was appointed commander of the war againstthe Cossacks, and a Red Army was recruited from among the factoryworkers. Hundreds of propagandists were sent to the Don. The Councilof People's Commissars issued a proclamation to the Cossacks, (SeeApp. XI, Sect. 16) explaining what the Soviet Government was, howthe propertied classes, the _tchin ovniki,_ landlords, bankers andtheir allies, the Cossack princes, land-owners and Generals, weretrying to destroy the Revolution, and prevent the confiscation oftheir wealth by the people.On November 27th a committee of Cossacks came to Smolny to seeTrotzky and Lenin. They demanded if it were true that the SovietGovernment did not intend to divide the Cossack lands among thepeasants of Great Russia? "No," answered Trotzky. The Cossacksdeliberated for a while. "Well," they asked, "does the SovietGovernment intend to confiscate the estates of our great Cossackland-owners and divide them among the working Cossacks?" To thisLenin replied. "That," he said, "is for _you_ to do. We shallsupport the working Cossacks in all their actions.... The best way tobegin is to form Cossacks Soviets; you will be given representationin the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and then it will be _your_ Government, too....The Cossacks departed, thinking hard. Two weeks later GeneralKaledin received a deputation from his troops. "Will you," theyasked, "promise to divide the great estates of the Cossack landlordsamong the working Cossacks?""Only over my dead body," responded Kaledin. A month later, seeinghis army melt away before his eyes, Kaledin blew out his brains. Andthe Cossack movement was no more....Meanwhile at Moghilev were gathered the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ the"moderate" Socialist leaders-from Avksentiev to Tchernov-the activechiefs of the old Army Committees, and the reactionary officers. TheStaff steadily refused to recognise the Council of People'sCommissars. It had united about it the Death Battalions, the Knightsof St. George, and the Cossacks of the Front, and was in close andsecret touch with the Allied military attachès, and with the Kaledinmovement and the Ukrainean Rada....The Allied Governments had made no reply to the Peace decree ofNovember 8th, in which the Congress of Soviets had asked for ageneral armistice.On November 20th Trotzky addressed a note to the Allied Ambassadors:(See App. XI, Sect. 18)I have the honour to inform you, Mr. Ambassador, that theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets... on November 8th constituted a newGovernment of the Russian Republic, in the form of the Council ofPeople's Commissars. The President of this Government is VladimirIlyitch Lenin. The direction of Foreign Affairs has been entrustedto me, People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs....In drawing your attention to the text, approved by the All-RussianCongress, of the proposition for an armistice and a democratic peacewithout annexations or indemnities, based on the right ofself-determination of peoples, I have the honour to request you toconsider that document as a formal proposal of an immediatearmistice on all fronts, and the opening of immediate peacenegotiations; a proposal which the authorised Government of theRussian Republic addresses at the same time to all the belligerentpeoples and their Governments.Please accept, Mr. Ambassador, the profound assurance of the esteemof the Soviet Government toward your people, who cannot but wish forpeace, like all the other peoples exhausted and drained by thisunexampled butchery....The same night the Council of People's Commissars telegraphed toGeneral Dukhonin:... The Council of People's Commissars considers it indispensablewithout delay to make a formal proposal of armistice to all thepowers, both enemy and Allied. A declaration conforming to thisdecision has been sent by the Commissar for Foreign Affairs to therepresentatives of the Allied powers at Petrograd.The Council of People's Commissars orders you, Citizen Commander,...to propose to the enemy military authorities immediately to ceasehostilities, and enter into negotiations for peace.In charging you with the conduct of these preliminary pourparlers,the Council of People's Commissars orders you:1. To inform the Council by direct wire immediately of any and allsteps in the pourparlers with the representatives of the enemyarmies.2. Not to sign the act of armistice until it has been passed upon bythe Council of People's Commissars.The Allied Ambassadors received Trotzky's note with contemptuoussilence, accompanied by anonymous interviews in the newspapers, fullof spite and ridicule. The order to Dukhonin was characterisedopenly as an act of treason....As for Dukhonin, he gave no sign. On the night of November 22nd hewas communicated with by telephone, and asked if he intended to obeythe order. Dukhonin answered that he could not, unless it emanatedfrom "a Government sustained by the Army and the country."By telegraph he was immediately dismissed from the post of SupremeCommander, and Krylenko appointed in his place. Following histactics of appealing to the masses, Lenin sent a radio to allregimental, divisional and corps Committees, to all soldiers andsailors of the Army and the Fleet, acquainting them with Dukhonin'srefusal, and ordering that "the regiments on the front shall electdelegates to begin negotiations with the enemy detachments oppositetheir positions...."On the 23d, the military attaches of the Allied nations, acting oninstructions from their Governments, presented a note to Dukhonin,in which he was solemnly warned not to "violate the conditions ofthe treaties concluded between the Powers of the Entente." The notewent on to say that if a separate armistice with Germany wereconcluded, that act "would result in the most serious consequences"to Russia. This communication Dukhonin at once sent out to all thesoldiers' Committees....Next morning Trotzky made another appeal to the troops,characterising the note of the Allied representatives as a flagrantinterference in the internal affairs of Russia, and a bald attempt"to force by threats the Russian Army and the Russian people tocontinue the war in execution of the treaties concluded by theTsar...."From Smolny poured out proclamation after proclamation, (See App.XI, Sect. 19) denouncing Dukhonin and the counter-revolutionaryofficers about him, denouncing the reactionary politicians gatheredat Moghilev, rousing, from one end of the thousand-mile Front to theother, millions of angry, suspicious soldiers. And at the same timeKrylenko, accompanied by three detachments of fanatical sailors, setout for the _Stavka,_ breathing threats of vengeance, (See App. XI,Sect. 20) and received by the soldiers everywhere with tremendousovations-a triumphal progress. The Central Army Committee issued adeclaration in favour of Dukhonin; and at once ten thousand troopsmoved upon Moghilev....On December 2d the garrison of Moghilev rose and seized the city,arresting Dukhonin and the Army Committee, and going out withvictorious red banners to meet the new Supreme Commander. Krylenkoentered Moghilev next morning, to find a howling mob gathered aboutthe railway-car in which Dukhonin had been imprisoned. Krylenko madea speech in which he implored the soldiers not to harm Dukhonin, ashe was to be taken to Petrograd and judged by the RevolutionaryTribunal. When he had finished, suddenly Dukhonin himself appearedat the window, as if to address the throng. But with a savage roarthe people rushed the car, and falling upon the old General, draggedhim out and beat him to death on the platform....So ended the revolt of the _Stavka_....Immensely strengthened by the collapse of the last importantstronghold of hostile military power in Russia, the SovietGovernment began with confidence the organisation of the state. Manyof the old functionaries flocked to its banner, and many members ofother parties entered the Government service. The financiallyambitious, however, were checked by the decree on Salaries ofGovernment Employees, fixing the salaries of the People'sCommissars-the highest-at five hundred rubles (about fifty dollars)a month.... The strike of Government Employees, led by the Union ofUnions, collapsed, deserted by the financial and commercialinterests which had been backing it. The bank clerks returned totheir jobs....With the decree on the Nationalisation of Banks, the formation ofthe Supreme Council of People's Economy, the putting into practicaloperation of the Land decree in the villages, the democraticreorganisation of the Army, and the sweeping changes in all branchesof the Government and of life,-with all these, effective only by thewill of the masses of workers, soldiers and peasants, slowly began,with many mistakes and hitches, the moulding of proletarian Russia.Not by compromise with the propertied classes, or with the otherpolitical leaders; not by conciliating the old Government mechanism,did the Bolsheviki conquer the power. Nor by the organized violenceof a small clique. If the masses all over Russia had not been readyfor insurrection it must have failed. The only reason for Bolsheviksuccess lay in their accomplishing the vast and simple desires ofthe most profound strata of the people, calling them to the work oftearing down and destroying the old, and afterward, in the smoke offalling ruins, cooperating with them to erect the frame-work of thenew....                              Chapter XII                        The Peasants' CongressIT was on November 18th that the snow came. In the morning we woketo window-ledges heaped white, and snowflakes falling so whirlingthick that it was impossible to see ten feet ahead. The mud wasgone; in a twinkling the gloomy city became white, dazzling. The_droshki_ with their padded coachmen turned into sleights, boundingalong the uneven street at headlong speed, their drivers' beardsstiff and frozen.... In spite of Revolution, all Russia plungingdizzily into the unknown and terrible future, joy swept the citywith the coming of the snow. Everybody was smiling; people ran intothe streets, holding out their arms to the soft, falling flakes,laughing. Hidden was all the greyness; only the gold and colouredspires and cupolas, with heightened barbaric splendour, gleamedthrough the white snow.Even the sun came out, pale and watery, at noon. The colds andrheumatism of the rainy months vanished. The life of the city grewgay, and the very Revolution ran swifter....I sat one evening in a _traktir_-a kind of lower-class inn-acrossthe street from the gates of Smolny; a low-ceilinged, loud placecalled "Uncle Tom's Cabin," much frequented by Red Guards. Theycrowded it now, packed close around the little tables with theirdirty table-cloths and enormous china tea-pots, filling the placewith foul cigarette-smoke, while the harassed waiters ran aboutcrying _"Seichass! Seichass!_ In a minute! Right away!"In one corner sat a man in the uniform of a captain, addressing theassembly, which interrupted him at every few words."You are no better than murderers!" he cried. "Shooting down yourRussian brothers on the streets!""When did we do that?" asked a worker."Last Sunday you did it, when the _yunkers_--""Well, didn't they shoot us?" One man exhibited his arm in a sling."Haven't I got something to remember them by, the devils?"The captain shouted at the top of his voice. "You should remainneutral! You should remain neutral! Who are you to destroy the legalGovernment? Who is Lenin? A German--""Who are you? A counter-revolutionist! A provocator!" they bellowedat him.When he could make himself heard the captain stood up. "All right!"said he. "You call yourselves the people of Russia. But you're _not_the people of Russia. The _peasants_ are the people of Russia. Waituntil the peasants--""Yes," they cried, "wait until the peasants speak. We know what thepeasants will say.... Aren't they workingmen like ourselves?"In the long run, everything depended upon the peasants. While thepeasants had been politically backward, still they had their ownpeculiar ideas, and they constituted more than eighty per cent ofthe people of Russia. The Bolsheviki had a comparatively smallfollowing among the peasants; and a permanent dictatorship of Russiaby the industrial workers was impossible.... The traditional peasantparty was the Socialist Revolutionary party; of all the parties nowsupporting the Soviet Government, the Left Socialist Revolutionarieswere the logical inheritors of peasant leadership-and the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries, who were at the mercy of the organisedcity proletariat, desperately needed the backing of the peasants....Meanwhile Smolny had not neglected the peasants. After the Landdecree, one of the first actions of the new _Tsay-ee-kah_ had beento call a Congress of Peasants, over the head of the ExecutiveCommittee of the Peasants' Soviets. A few days later was issueddetailed Regulations for the _Volost_ (Township) Land Committees,followed by Lenin's "Instruction to Peasants," (See App. XII, Sect.1) which explained the Bolshevik revolution and the new Governmentin simple terms; and on November 16th, Lenin and Miliutin publishedthe "Instructions to Provincial Emissaries," of whom thousands weresent by the Soviet Government into the villages.1. Upon his arrival in the province to which he is accredited, theemissary should call a joint meeting of the Central ExecutiveCommittees of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants'Deputies, to whom he should make a report on the agrarian laws, andthen demand that a joint plenary session of the Soviets be summoned....2. He must study the aspects of the agrarian problem in the province.a. Has the land-owners' property been taken over, and if so, in whatdistricts?b. Who administers the confiscated land-the former proprietor, orthe Land Committees?c. What has been done with the agricultural machinery and with thefarm-animals?3. Has the ground cultivated by the peasants been augmented?4. How much and in what respect does the amount of land now undercultivation differ from the amount fixed by the Government as anaverage minimum?5. The emissary must insist that, after the peasants have receivedthe land, it is imperative that they increase the amount ofcultivated land as quickly as possible, and that they hasten thesending of grain to the cities, as the only means of avoiding famine.6. What are the measures projected or put into effect for thetransfer of land from the land-owners to the Land Committees andsimilar bodies appointed by the Soviets?7. It is desirable that agricultural properties well appointed andwell organised should be administered by Soviets composed of theregular employees of those properties, under the direction ofcompetent agricultural scientists.All through the villages a ferment of change was going on, causednot only by the electrifying action of the Land decree, but also bythousands of revolutionary-minded peasant-soldiers returning fromthe front.... These men, especially, welcomed the call to a Congressof Peasants.Like the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ in the matter of the second Congress ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Soviets, the Executive Committee tried toprevent the Peasant Congress summoned by Smolny. And like the old_Tsay-ee-kah,_ finding its resistance futile, the ExecutiveCommittee sent frantic telegrams ordering the election ofConservative delegates. Word was even spread among the peasants thatthe Congress would meet at Moghilev, and some delegates went there;but by November 23d about four hundred had gathered in Petrograd,and the party caucuses had begun....The first session took place in the Alexander Hall of the Dumabuilding, and the first vote showed that more than half of all thedelegates were Left Socialist Revolutionaries, while the Bolshevikicontrolled a bare fifth, the conservative Socialist Revolutionariesa quarter, and all the rest were united only in their opposition tothe old Executive Committee, dominated by Avksentiev, Tchaikovskyand Peshekhonov....The great hall was jammed with people and shaken with continualclamour; deep, stubborn bitterness divided the delegates into angrygroups. To the right was a sprinkling of officers' epaulettes, andthe patriarchal, bearded faces of the older, more substantialpeasants; in the centre were a few peasants, non-commissionedofficers, and some soldiers; and on the left almost all thedelegates wore the uniforms of common soldiers. These last were theyoung generation, who had been serving in the army.... The gallerieswere thronged with workers-who, in Russia, still remember theirpeasant origin....Unlike the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the Executive Committee, in openingthe session, did not recognise the Congress as official; theofficial Congress was called for December 13th; amid a hurricane ofapplause and angry cries, the speaker declared that this gatheringwas merely "Extraordinary Conference"... But the "ExtraordinaryConference" soon showed its attitude toward the Executive Committeeby electing as presiding officer Maria Spiridonova, leader of theLeft Socialist Revolution aries.Most of the first day was taken up by a violent debate as to whetherthe representatives of _Volost_ Soviets should be seated, or onlydelegates from the Provincial bodies; and just as in the Workers'and Soldiers' Congress, an overwhelming majority declared in favourof the widest possible representation. Whereupon the old ExecutiveCommittee left the hall....Almost immediately it was evident that most of the delegates werehostile to the Government of the People's Commissars. Zinoviev,attempting to speak for the Bolsheviki, was hooted down, and as heleft the platform, amid laughter, there were cries, "There's how aPeople's Commissar sits in a mudpuddle!""We Left Socialist Revolutionaries refuse," cried Nazariev, adelegate from the Provinces, "to recognise this so-called Workers'and Peasants' Government until the peasants are represented in it.At present it is nothing but a dictatorship of the workers.... Weinsist upon the formation of a new Government which will representthe entire democracy!"The reactionary delegates shrewdly fostered this feeling, declaring,in the face of protests from the Bolshevik benches, that the Councilof People's Commissars intended either to control the Congress ordissolve it by force of arms-an announcement which was received bythe peasants with bursts of fury....On the third day Lenin suddenly mounted the tribune; for ten minutesthe room went mad. "Down with him!" they shrieked. "We will notlisten to any of your People's Commissars! We don't recognise yourGovernment!"Lenin stood there quite calmly, gripping the desk with both hands,his little eyes thoughtfully surveying the tumult beneath. Finally,except for the right side of the hall, the demonstration wore itselfout somewhat."I do not come here as a member of the Council of People'sCommissars," said Lenin, and waited again for the noise to subside,"but as a member of the Bolshevik faction, duly elected to thisCongress." And he held his credentials up to that all might see them."However," he went on, in an unmoved voice, "nobody will deny thatthe present Government of Russia has been formed by the Bolshevikparty-" he had to wait a moment, "so that for all purposes it is thesame thing...." Here the right benches broke into deafening clamour,but the centre and left were curious, and compelled silence.Lenin's argument was simple. "Tell me frankly, you peasants, to whomwe have given the lands of the _pomieshtchiki;_ do you want now toprevent the workers from getting control of industry? This is classwar. The _pomieshtchiki_ of course oppose the peasants, and themanufactures oppose the workers. Are you going to allow the ranks ofthe proletariat to be divided? Which side will you be on?"We, the Bolsheviki, are the party of the proletariat-of the peasantproletariat as well as the industrial proletariat. We, theBolsheviki, are the protectors of the Soviets-of the Peasants'Soviets as well as those of the Workers and Soldiers. The presentGovernment is a Government of Soviets; we have not only invited thePeasants' Soviets to join that Government, but we have also invitedrepresentatives of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to enter theCouncil of People's Commissars...."The Soviets are the most perfect representatives of the people-ofthe workers in the factories and mines, of the workers in thefields. Anybody who attempts to destroy the Soviets is guilty of ananti-democratic and counter-revolutionary act. And I serve noticehere on you, comrades _Right_ Socialist Revolutionaries-and on you,Messrs. Cadets-that if the Constituent Assembly attempts to destroythe Soviets, we shall not permit the Constituent Assembly to do thisthing!"On the afternoon of November 25th Tchernov arrived in hot haste fromMoghilev, summoned by the Executive Committee. Only two monthsbefore considered an extreme revolutionist, and very popular withthe peasants, he was now called to check the dangerous drift of theCongress toward the Left. Upon his arrival Tchernov was arrested andtaken to Smolny, where, after a short conversation, he was released.His first act was to bitterly rebuke the Executive Committee forleaving the Congress. They agreed to return, and Tchernov enteredthe hall, welcomed with great applause by the majority, and thehoots and jeers of the Bolsheviki."Comrades! I have been away. I participated in the Conference of theTwelfth Army on the question of calling a Congress of all thePeasant delegates of the armies of the Western Front, and I knowvery little about the insurrection which occurred here--"Zinoviev rose in his seat, and shouted, "Yes, you were away-for afew minutes!" Fearful tumult. Cries, "Down with the Bolsheviki!"Tchernov continued. "The accusation that I helped lead an army onPetrograd has no foundation, and is entirely false. Where does suchan accusation come from? Show me the source!"Zinoviev: "_Izviestia_ and _Dielo Naroda_-your own paper -that'swhere it comes from!"Tchernov's wide face, with the small eyes, waving hair and greyishbeard, became red with wrath, but he controlled himself and went on."I repeat, I know practically nothing about what has happened here,and I did not lead any army except this army, (he pointed to thepeasant delegates), which I am largely responsible for bringinghere!" Laughter, and shouts of "Bravo!""Upon my return I visited Smolny. No such accusation was madeagainst me there.... After a brief conversation I left-and that's all!Let any one present make such an accusation!"An uproar followed, in which the Bolsheviki and some of the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries were on their feet all at once, shakingtheir fists and yelling, and the rest of the assembly tried to yellthem down."This is an outrage, not a session!" cried Tchernov, and he left thehall; the meeting was adjourned because of the noise and disorder....Meanwhile, the question of the status of the Executive Committee wasagitating all minds. By declaring the assembly "ExtraordinaryConference," it had been planned to block the reelection of theExecutive Committee. But this worked both ways; the Left SocialistRevolutionists decided that if the Congress had no power over theExecutive Committee, then the Executive Committee had no power overthe Congress. On November 25th the assembly resolved that the powersof the Executive Committee be assumed by the ExtraordinaryConference, in which only members of the Executive who had beenelected as delegates might vote....The next day, in spite of the bitter opposition of the Bolsheviki,the resolution was amended to give all the members of the ExecutiveCommittee, whether elected as delegates or not, voice and vote inthe assembly.On the 27th occurred the debate on the Land question, which revealedthe differences between the agrarian programme of the Bolsheviki andthe Left Socialist Revolutionaries.Kolchinsky, for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, outlined thehistory of the Land question during the Revolution. The firstCongress of Peasants' Soviets, he said, had voted a precise andformal resolution in favour of putting the landed estatesimmediately into the hands of the Land Committees. But the directorsof the Revolution, and the bourgeois in the Government, had insistedthat the question could not be solved until the Constituent Assemblymet.... The second period of the Revolution, the period of"compromise,"was signalled by the entrance of Tchernov into theCabinet. The peasants were convinced that now the practical solutionof the Land question would begin; but in spite of the imperativedecision of the first Peasant Congress, the reactionaries andconciliators in the Executive Committee had prevented any action.This policy provoked a series of agrarian disorders, which appearedas the natural expression of impatience and thwarted energy on thepart of the peasants. The peasants understood the exact meaning ofthe Revolution-they tried to turn words into action...."The recent events," said the orator, "do not indicate a simpleriot, or a 'Bolshevik adventure,' but on the contrary, a realpopular rising, which has been greeted with sympathy by the wholecountry...."The Bolsheviki in general took the correct attitude toward the Landquestion; but in recommending that the peasants seize the land byforce, they committed a profound error.... From the first days, theBolsheviki declared that the peasants should take over the land 'byrevolutionary massaction.' This is nothing but anarchy; the land canbe taken over in an organised manner.... For the Bolsheviki it wasimportant that the problems of the Revolution should be solved inthe quickest possible manner-but the Bolsheviki were not interestedin _how_ these problems were to be solved...."The Land decree of the Congress of Soviets is identical in itsfundamentals with the decisions of the first Peasants' Congress. Whythen did not the new Government follow the tactics outlined by thatCongress? Because the Council of People's Commissars wanted tohasten the settlement of the Land question, so that the ConstituentAssembly would have nothing to do...."But also the Government saw that it was necessary to adoptpractical measures, so without further reflection, it adopted theRegulations for Land Committees, thus creating a strange situation;for the Council of People's Commissars abolished private property inland, but the Regulations drawn up by the Land Committees are basedon private property.... However, no harm has been done by that; forthe Land Committees are paying no attention to the Soviet decrees,but are putting into operation their own practicaldecisions-decisions based on the will of the vast majority of thepeasants...."These Land Committees are not attempting the legislative solutionof the Land question, which belongs to the Constituent Assemblyalone.... But will the Constituent Assembly desire to do the will ofthe Russian peasants? Of that we cannot be sure.... All we can be sureof is that the revolutionary determination of the peasants is nowaroused, and that the Constituent will be _forced_ to settle theLand question the way the peasants want it settled.... The ConstituentAssembly will not dare to break with the will of the people...."Followed him Lenin, listened to now with absorbing intensity. "Atthis moment we are not only trying to solve the Land question, butthe question of Social Revolution-not only here in Russia, but allover the world. The Land question cannot be solved independently ofthe other problems of the Social Revolution.... For example, theconfiscation of the landed estates will provoke the resistance notonly of Russian land-owners, but also of foreign capital-with whomthe great landed properties are connected through the intermediaryof the banks...."The ownership of the land in Russia is the basis for immenseoppression, and the confiscation of the land by the peasants is themost important step of our Revolution. But it cannot be separatedfrom the other steps, as is clearly manifested by the stages throughwhich the Revolution has had to pass. The first stage was thecrushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of theindustrial capitalists and land-owners, whose interests are closelyrelated. The second stage was the strengthening of the Soviets andthe political compromise with the bourgeoisie. The mistake of theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries lies in the fact that at that timethey did not oppose the policy of compromise, because they held thetheory that the consciousness of the masses was not yet fullydeveloped...._"If Socialism can only be realised when the intellectualdevelopment of all the people permits it, then we shall not seeSocialism for at least five hundred years_.... The Socialist politicalparty-this is the vanguard of the working-class; it must not allowitself to be halted by the lack of education of the mass average,but it must lead the masses, using the Soviets as organs ofrevolutionary initiative.... But in order to lead the wavering, thecomrades Left Socialist Revolutionaries themselves must stophesitating...."In July last a series of open breaks began between the popularmasses and the 'compromisers'; but now, in November, the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries are still holding out their hand toAvksentiev, who is pulling the people with his little finger.... IfCompromise continues, the Revolution disappears. No compromise withthe bourgeoisie is possible; its power must be absolutely crushed...."We Bolsheviki have not changed our Land programme; we have notgiven up the abolition of private property in the land, and we donot intend to do so. We adopted the Regulations for LandCommittees,-which are _not_ based on private property at all-becausewe want to accomplish the popular will in the way the people havethemselves decided to do it, so as to draw closer the coalition ofall the elements who are fighting for the Social Revolution."We invite the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to enter thatcoalition, insisting, however, that they cease looking backward, andthat they break with the 'conciliators' of their party...."As far as the Constituent Assembly is concerned, it is true, as thepreceding speaker has said, that the work of the Constituent willdepend on the revolutionary determination of the masses. I say,'Count on that revolutionary determination, but don't forget yourgun!'"Lenin then read the Bolshevik resolution:The Peasants' Congress, fully supporting the Land decree of November8th... approves of the Provisional Workers' and Peasants' Governmentof the Russian Republic, established by the second All-RussianCongress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.The Peasants' Congress... invites all peasants unanimously to sustainthat law, and to apply it immediately themselves; and at the sametime invites the peasants to appoint to posts and positions ofresponsibility only persons who have proved, not by words but byacts, their entire devotion to the interests of the exploitedpeasant-workers, their desire and their ability to defend theseinterests against all resistance on the part of the greatland-owners, the capitalists, their partisans and accomplices....The Peasants' Congress, at the same time, expresses its convictionthat the complete realisation of all the measures which make up theLand decree can only be successful through the triumph of theWorkers' Social Revolution, which began November 7th, 1917; for onlythe Social Revolution can accomplish the definite transfer, withoutpossibility of return, of the land to the peasant-workers, theconfiscation of model farms and their surrender to the peasantcommunes, the confiscation of agricultural machinery belonging tothe great land-owners, the safe-guarding of the interests of theagricultural workers by the complete abolition of wage-slavery, theregular and methodical distribution among all regions of Russia ofthe products of agriculture and industry, and the seizure of thebanks (without which the possession of land by the whole peoplewould be impossible, after the abolition of private property), andall sorts of assistance by the State to the workers....For these reasons the Peasants' Congress sustains entirely theRevolution of November 7th... as a social revolution, and expressesits unalterable will to put into operation, with whatevermodifications are necessary, but without any hesitation, the socialtransformation of the Russian Republic.The indispensable conditions of the victory of the SocialRevolution, which alone will secure the lasting success and thecomplete realisation of the Land decree, is the close union of thepeasant-workers with the industrial working-class, with theproletariat of all advanced countries. From now on, in the RussianRepublic, all the organisation and administration of the State, fromtop to bottom, must rest on that union. That union, crushing allattempts, direct or indirect, open or dissimulated, to return to thepolicy of conciliation with the bourgeoisie-conciliation, damned byexperience, with the chiefs of bourgeois politics-can alone insurethe victory of Socialism throughout the world....The reactionaries of the Executive Committee no longer dared openlyto appear. Tchernov, however, spoke several times, with a modest andwinning impartiality. He was invited to sit on the platform.... On thesecond night of the Congress an anonymous note was handed up to thechairman, requesting that Tchernov be made honorary President.Ustinov read the note aloud, and immediately Zinoviev was on hisfeet, screaming that this was a trick of the old Executive Committeeto capture the convention; in a moment the hall was one bellowingmass of waving arms and angry faces, on both sides.... Nevertheless,Tchernov remained very popular.In the stormy debates on the Land question and the Lenin resolution,the Bolsheviki were twice on the point of quitting the assembly,both times restrained by their leaders.... It seemed to me as if theCongress were hopelessly deadlocked.But none of us knew that a series of secret conferences were alreadygoing on between the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and theBolsheviki at Smolny. At first the Left Socialist Revolutionarieshad demanded that there be a Government composed of all theSocialist parties in and out of the Soviets, to be responsible to aPeople's Council, composed of an equal number of delegates from theWorkers' and Soldiers' organisation, and that of the Peasants, andcompleted by representatives of the City Dumas and the Zemstvos;Lenin and Trotzky were to be eliminated, and the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee and other repressive organs dissolved.Wednesday morning, November 28th, after a terrible all-nightstruggle, an agreement was reached. The _Tsay-ee-kah,_composed of108 members, was to be augumented by 108 members electedproportionally from the Peasants' Congress; by 100 delegates electeddirectly from the Army and the Fleet; and by 50 representatives ofthe Trade Unions (35 from the general Unions, 10 Railway Workers,and 5 from the Post and Telegraph Workers). The Dumas and Zemstvoswere dropped. Lenin and Trotzky remained in the Government, and theMilitary Revolutionary Committee continued to function.The sessions of the Congress had now been removed to the ImperialLaw School building, Fontanka 6, headquarters of the Peasants'Soviets. There in the great meeting-hall the delegates gathered onWednesday afternoon. The old Executive Committee had withdrawn, andwas holding a rump convention of its own in another room of the samebuilding, made up of bolting delegates and representatives of theArmy Committees.Tchernov went from one meeting to the other, keeping a watchful eyeon the proceedings. He knew that an agreement with the Bolshevikiwas being discussed, but he did not know that it had been concluded.He spoke to the rump convention. "At present, when everybody is infavour of forming an all-Socialist Government, many people forgetthe first Ministry, which was _not_ a coalition Government, and inwhich there was only one Socialist-Kerensky; a Government which, inits time, was very popular. Now people accuse Kerensky; they forgetthat he was raised to power, not only by the Soviets, but also bythe popular masses...."Why did public opinion change toward Kerensky? The savages set upgods to which they pray, and which they punish if one of theirprayers is not answered.... That is what is happening at this moment....Yesterday Kerensky; today Lenin and Trotzky; another to-morrow...."We have proposed to both Kerensky and the Bolsheviki to retire fromthe power. Kerensky has accepted-to-day he announced from hishiding-place that he has resigned as Premier; but the Bolshevikiwish to retain the power, and they do not know how to use it...."If the Bolsheviki succeed, or if they fail, the fate of Russia willnot be changed. The Russian villages understand perfectly what theywant, and they are now carrying out their own measures.... Thevillages will save us in the end...."In the meanwhile, in the great hall Ustinov had announced theagreement between the Peasants' Congress and Smolny, received by thedelegates with the wildest joy. Suddenly Tchernov appeared, anddemanded the floor."I understand," he began, "that an agreement is being concludedbetween the Peasants' Congress and Smolny. Such an agreement wouldbe illegal, seeing that the true Congress of Peasants' Soviets doesnot meet until next week...."Moreover, I want to warn you now that the Bolsheviki will neveraccept your demands...."He was interrupted by a great burst of laughter; and realising thesituation, he left the platform and the room, taking his popularitywith him....Late in the afternoon of Thursday, November 16th, the Congress metin extraordinary session. There was a holiday feeling in the air; onevery face was a smile.... The remainder of the business before theassembly was hurried through, and then old Nathanson, thewhite-bearded dean of the left wing of the SocialistRevolutionaries, his voice trembling and tears in his eyes, read thereport of the "wedding" of the Peasants' Soviets with the Workers'and Soldiers' Soviets. At every mention of the word "union" therewas ecstatic applause.... At the end Ustinov announced the arrivalrival of a delegation from Smolny, accompanied by representatives ofthe Red Army, greeted with a rising ovation. One after another aworkman, a soldier and a sailor took the floor, hailing them.Then Boris Reinstein, delegate of the American Socialist LaborParty: "The day of the union of the Congress of Peasants and theSoviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies is one of the great daysof the Revolution. The sound of it will ring with resounding echoesthroughout the whole world-in Paris, in London, and across theocean-in New York. This union will fill with happiness the hearts ofall toilers."A great idea has triumphed. The West, and America, expected fromRussia, from the Russian proletariat, something tremendous.... Theproletariat of the world is waiting for the Russian Revolution,waiting for the great things that it is accomplishing...."Sverdlov, president of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ greeted them. And with theshout, "Long live the end of civil war! Long live the UnitedDemocracy!" the peasants poured out of the building.It was already dark, and on the ice-covered snow glittered the palelight of moon and star. Along the bank of the canal were drawn up infull marching order the soldiers of the Pavlovsky Regiment, withtheir band, which broke into the _Marseillaise._ Amid the crashingfull-throated shouts of the soldiers, the peasants formed in line,unfurling the great red banner of the Executive Committee of theAll-Russian Peasants' Soviets, embroidered newly in gold, "Long livethe union of the revolutionary and toiling masses!" Following wereother banners; of the District Soviets-of Putilov Factory, whichread, "We bow to this flag in order to create the brotherhood of allpeople!"From somewhere torches appeared, blazing orange in the night, athousand times reflected in the facets of the ice, streaming outsmokily over the throng as it moved down the bank of the Fontankasinging, between crowds that stood in astonished silence."Long live the Revolutionary Army! Long live the Red Guard! Longlive the Peasants!"So the great procession wound through the city, growing andunfurling ever new red banners lettered in gold. Two old peasants,bowed with toil, were walking hand in hand, their faces illuminedwith child-like bliss."Well," said one, "I'd like to see them take away our land again,_now!_Near Smolny the Red Guard was lined up on both sides of the street,wild with delight. The other old peasant spoke to his comrade, "I amnot tired," he said. "I walked on air all the way!"On the steps of Smolny about a hundred Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies were massed, with their banner, dark against the blaze oflight streaming out between the arches. Like a wave they rusheddown, clasping the peasants in their arms and kissing them; and theprocession poured in through the great door and up the stairs, witha noise like thunder....In the immense white meeting-room the _Tsay-ee-kah_ was waiting,with the whole Petrograd Soviet and a thousand spectators beside,with that solemnity which attends great conscious moments in history.Zinoviev announced the agreement with the Peasants' Congress, to ashaking roar which rose and burst into storm as the sound of musicblared down the corridor, and the head of the procession came in. Onthe platform the presidium rose and made place for the Peasants'presidium, the two embracing; behind them the two banners wereintertwined against the white wall, over the empty frame from whichthe Tsar's picture had been torn....Then opened the "triumphal session." After a few words of welcomefrom Sverdlov, Maria Spiridonova, slight, pale, with spectacles andhair drawn flatly down, and the air of a New England school-teacher,took the tribune-the most loved and the most powerful woman in allRussia."... Before the workers of Russia open now horizons which history hasnever known.... All workers' movements in the past have been defeated.But the present movement is international, and that is why it isinvincible. There is no force in the world which can put out thefire of the Revolution! The old world crumbles down, the new worldbegins...."Then Trotzky, full of fire: "I wish you welcome, comrades peasants!You come here not as guests, but as masters of this house, whichholds the heart of the Russian Revolution. The will of millions ofworkers is now concentrated in this hall.... There is now only onemaster of the Russian land: the union of the workers, soldiers andpeasants...."With biting sarcasm he went on to speak of the Allied diplomats,till then contemptuous of Russia's invitation to an armistice, whichhad been accepted by the Central Powers."A new humanity will be born of this war.... In this hall we swear toworkers of all lands to remain at our revolutionary post. If we arebroken, then it will be in defending our flag...."Krylenko followed him, explaining the situation at the front, whereDukhonin was preparing to resist the Council of People's Commissars."Let Dukhonin and those with him understand well that we shall notdeal gently with those who bar the road to peace!"Dybenko saluted the assembly in the name of the Fleet, andKrushinsky, member of the _Vikzhel,_ said, "From this moment, whenthe union of all true Socialists is realised, the whole army ofrailway workers places itself absolutely at the disposition of therevolutionary democracy!" And Lunatcharsky, almost weeping, andProshian, for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, and finallySaharashvili, for the United Social Democrats Internationalists,composed of members of the Martov's and of Gorky's groups, whodeclared:"We left the _Tsay-ee-kah_ because of the uncompromising policy ofthe Bolsheviki, and to force them to make concessions in order torealise the union of all the revolutionary democracy. Now that thatunion is brought about, we consider it a sacred duty to take ourplaces once more in the _Tsay-ee-kah_.... We declare that all thosewho have withdrawn from the _Tsay-ee-kah_ should now return."Stachkov, a dignified old peasant of the presidium of the Peasants'Congress, bowed to the four corners of the room. "I greet you withthe christening of a new Russian life and freedom!"Gronsky, in the name of the Polish Social Democracy; Skripnik, forthe Factory-Shop Committees; Tifonov, for the Russian soldiers atSalonika; and others, interminably, speaking out of full hearts,with the happy eloquence of hopes fulfilled....It was late in the night when the following resolution was put andpassed unanimously:"The _Tsay-ee-kah,_ united in extraordinary session with thePetrograd Soviet and the Peasants' Congress, confirms the Land andPeace decrees adopted by the second Congress of Soviets of Workers'and Soldiers' Deputies, and also the decree on Workers' Controladopted by the _Tsay-ee-kah._"The joint session of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and the Peasants' Congressexpresses its firm conviction that the union of workers, soldiersand peasants, this fraternal union of all the workers and allexploited, will consolidate the power conquered by them, that itwill take all revolutionary measures to hasten the passing of thepower into the hands of the working-class in other countries, andthat it will assure in this manner the lasting accomplishment of ajust peace and the victory of Socialism."(See App. XI, Sect. 2)                        APPENDIX TO CHAPTER I                                 1._Oborontsi_—“Defenders.” All the “moderate” Socialist groups adoptedor were given this name, because they consented to the continuationof the war under Allied leadership, on the ground that it was a warof National Defence. The Bolsheviki, the Left SocialistRevolutionaries, the Mensheviki Internationalists (Martov’s faction),and the Social Democrats Internationalists (Gorky’s group) were infavour of forcing the Allies to declare democratic war-aims, and tooffer peace to Germany on those terms….                                  2.

On an average, wagesincreased slightly more than 500 per cent….But at the same time the value of the ruble fell to less thanone-third its former purchasing power, and the cost of thenecessities of

         |+-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+On an average, the above categories of necessities increased about1,109 per cent in price, more than twice the increase of salaries.The difference, of course, went into the pockets of speculators andmerchants.In September, 1917, when I arrived in Petrograd, the average dailywage of a skilled industrial worker—for example, a steel-worker inthe Putilov Factory—was about 8 rubles. At the same time, profitswere enormous…. I was told by one of the owners of the ThorntonWoollen Mills, an English concern on the outskirts of Petrograd, thatwhile wages had increased about 300 per cent in his factory, hisprofits had gone up _900 per cent._                                 3.                        THE SOCIALIST MINISTERSThe history of the efforts of the Socialists in the ProvisionalGovernment of July to realise their programme in coalition with thebourgeois Ministers, is an illuminating example of class struggle inpolitics. Says Lenin, in explanation of this phenomenon:“The capitalists, … seeing that the position of the Government wasuntenable, resorted to a method which since 1848 has been for decadespractised by the capitalists in order to befog, divide, and finallyoverpower the working-class. This method is the so-called ‘CoalitionMinistry,’ composed of bourgeois and of renegades from the Socialistcamp.“In those countries where political freedom and democracy haveexisted side by side with the revolutionary movement of theworkers—for example in England and France—the capitalists make use ofthis subterfuge, and very successfully too. The ‘Socialist’ leaders,upon entering the Ministries, invariably prove mere figure-heads,puppets, simply a shield for the capitalists, a tool with which todefraud the workers. The ‘democratic’ and ‘republican’ capitalists inRussia set in motion this very same scheme. The SocialistRevolutionaries and Mensheviki fell victim to it, and on June 1st a‘Coalition’ Ministry, with the participation of Tchernov, Tseretelli,Skobeliev, Avksentiev, Savinkov, Zarudny and Nikitin became anaccomplished fact….”—_Problems of the Revolution._                                 4.                SEPTEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN MOSCOWIn the first week of October, 1917, _Novaya Zhizn_ published thefollowing comparative table of election results, pointing out thatthis meant the bankruptcy of the policy of Coalition with thepropertied classes. “If civil war can yet be avoided, it can only bedone by a united front of all the revolutionary democracy….”_Elections for the Moscow Central and Ward Dumas_.

GROWING ARROGANCE OF THE REACTIONARIESSeptember 18th. The Cadet Shulgin, writing in a Kiev newspaper, saidthat the Provisional Government’s declaration that Russia was aRepublic constituted a gross abuse of its powers. “We cannot admiteither a Republic, or the present Republican Government…. And we arenot sure that we want a Republic in Russia….”October 23d. At a meeting of the Cadet party held at Riazan, M.Dukhonin declared, “On March 1st we must establish a ConstitutionalMonarchy. We must not reject the legitimate heir to the throne,Mikhail Alexandrovitch….”October 27th. Resolution passed by the Conference of Business Men atMoscow:“The Conference… insists that the Provisional Government take thefollowing immediate measures in the Army:“1. Forbidding of all political propaganda; the Army must be out ofpolitics.“2. Propaganda of antinational and international ideas and theoriesdeny the necessity for armies, and hurt discipline; it should beforbidden, and all propagandists punished….“3. The function of the Army Committees must be limited to economicquestions exclusively. All their decisions should be confirmed bytheir superior officers, who have the right to dissolve theCommittees at any time….“4. The salute to be reestablished, and made obligatory. Fullreestablishment of disciplinary power in the hands of officers, withright of review of sentence….“5. Expulsion from the Corps of Officers of those who dishonour it byparticipating in the movement of the soldier-masses, which teachesthem disobedience…. Reestablishment for this purpose of the Courts ofHonor….“6. The Provisional Government should take the necessary measures tomake possible the return to the army of Generals and other officersunjustly discharged under the influence of Committees, and otherirresponsible organisations….”                       APPENDIX TO CHAPTER II                                 1.The Kornilov revolt is treated in detail in my forthcoming volume,“Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk.” The responsibility of Kerensky for thesituation which gave rise to Kornilov’s attempt is now pretty clearlyestablished. Many apologists for Kerensky say that he knew ofKornilov’s plans, and by a trick drew him out prematurely, and thencrushed him. Even Mr. A. J. Sack, in his book, “The Birth of theRussian Democracy,” says:“Several things… are almost certain. The first is that Kerensky knewabout the movement of several detachments from the Front towardPetrograd, and it is possible that as Prime Minister and Minister ofWar, realising the growing Bolshevist danger, he called for them….”The only flaw in that argument is that there was no “Bolshevistdanger” at that time, the Bolsheviki still being a powerless minorityin the Soviets, and their leaders in jail or hiding.                                 2.                        DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCEWhen the Democratic Conference was first proposed to Kerensky, hesuggested an assembly of all the elements in the nation—“the liveforces,” as he called them—including bankers, manufacturers,land-owners, and representatives of the Cadet party. The Sovietrefused, and drew up the following table of representation, whichKerensky agreed to:+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 100 delegates | All-Russian Soviets Workers’ and Soldiers’         ||               | Deputies                                           |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 100 delegates | All-Russian Soviets Peasants’ Deputies             |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 50 delegates  | Provincial Soviets Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 50 delegates  | Peasants’ District Land Committees                 |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 100 delegates | Trade Unions                                       |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 84 delegates  | Army Committees at the Front                       |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 150 delegates | Workers’ and Peasants’ Cooperative Societies       |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 20 delegates  | Railway Workers’ Union                             |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 10 delegates  | Post and Telegraph Workers’ Union                  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 20 delegates  | Commercial Clerks                                  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 15 delegates  | Liberal Professions—Doctors, Lawyers,              ||               | Journalists, etc.                                  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 50 delegates  | Provincial Zemstvos                                |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 59 delegates  | Nationalist Organisations—Poles, Ukraineans, etc.  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+This proportion was altered twice or three times.

THE FUNCTION OF THE SOVIETS IS ENDEDOn September 28th, 1917, _Izviestia,_ organ of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_published an article which said, speaking of the last ProvisionalMinistry:“At last a truly democratic government, born of the will of allclasses of the Russian people, the first rough form of the futureliberal parliamentary régime, has been formed. Ahead of us is theConstituent Assembly, which will solve all questions of fundamentallaw, and whose composition will be essentially democratic. Thefunction of the Soviets is at an end, and the time is approachingwhen they must retire, with the rest of the revolutionary machinery,from the stage of a free and victorious people, whose weapons shallhereafter be the peaceful ones of political action.”The leading article of _Izviestia_ for October 23d was called, “TheCrisis in the Soviet Organisations.” It began by saying thattravellers reported a lessening activity of local Soviets everywhere.“This is natural,” said the writer. “For the people are becominginterested in the more permanent legislative organs—the MunicipalDumas and the Zemstvs….“In the important centres of Petrograd and Moscow, where the Sovietswere best organised, they did not take in all the democraticelements…. The majority of the intellectuals did not participate, andmany workers also; some of the workers because they were politicallybackward, others because the centre of gravity for them was in theirUnns…. We cannot deny that these organisations are firmly united withthe masses, whose everyday needs are better served by them….“That the local democratic administrations are being energeticallyorganised is highly important. The City Dumas are elected byuniversal suffrage, and in purely local matters have more authoritythan the Soviets. Not a single democrat will see anything wrong inthis….“… Elections to the Municipalities are being conduct in a better andmore democratic way than the elections to the Soviets… All classesare represented in the Municipalities…. And as soon as the localSelf-Governments begin to organise life in the Municipalities, therôle of the local Soviets naturally ends….“… There are two factors in the falling off of interest in theSoviets. The first we may attribute to the lowering of politicalinterest in the masses; the second, to the growing effort ofprovincial and local governing bodies to organise the building of newRussia…. The more the tendency lies in this latter direction, thesooner disappears the significance of the Soviets….“We ourselves are being called the ‘undertakers’ of our ownorganisation. In reality, we ourselves are the hardest workers inconstructing the new Russia….“When autocracy and the whole bureaucratic règimeell, we set up theSoviets as a barracks in which all the democracy cod find temporaryshelter. Now, instead of barracks, we are building the permanentedifice of a new system, and naturally the people will graduallyleave the barracks for more comfortable quarters.”                                 4.        TROTZKY’S SPEECH AT THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIN REPUBLIC“The purpose of the Democratic Conference, which was called by the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ was to do away with the irresponsible personalgovernment which produced Kornilov, and to establish a responsiblegovernment which would be capable of finishing the war, and ensurethe calling of the Constituent Assembly at the given time. In themeanwhile behind the back of the Democratic Conference, by trickery,by deals between Citizen Kerensky, the Cadets, and the leaders of theMenshevik and Socialist Revolutionary parties, we received theopposite result from the officially announced purpose. A power wascreated around which and in which we have open and secret Kornilovsplaying leading parts. The irresponsibility of the Government isoffically proclaimed, when it is announced that the Council of theRussian Republic is to be a _consultative_ and not _legislative_body. In the eighth month of the Revolution, the irresponsibleGovernment creates a cover for itself in this new edition ofBieligen’s Duma.“The propertied classes have entered this Provision Council in aproportion which clearly shows, from elections all over the country,that many of them have no right here whatever. In spite of that theCadet party, which until yesterday wanted the Provisional Governmentto be responsible to the State Duma—this same Cadet party secured theindependence Assembly the propertied classes will no doubt have asfavourable position than they have in this Council, and they will notbe able to be irresponsible to the Constituent Assembly.“If the propertied classes were really getting ready for theConstituent Assembly six weeks from now, there could be no reason forestablishing the irresponsibility of the Government at this time. Thewhole truth is that the bourgeoisie, which directs the policies ofthe Provisional Government, has for its aim to break the ConstituentAssembly. At present this is the main purpose of the propertiedclasses, which control our entire national policy—external andinternal. In the industrial, agrarian and supply departments thepolitics of the propertied classes, acting with the Government,increases the natural disorganisation caused by the war. Thepropertied classes, which are provoking a peasants’ revolt! Thepropertied classes, which are provoking civil war, and openly holdtheir course on the bony hand of hunger, with which they intend tooverthrow the Revolution and finish with the Constituent Assembly!“No less criminal also is the international policy of the bourgeoisieand its Government. After forty months of war, the capital isthreatened with mortal danger. In reply to this arises a plan to movethe Government to Moscow. The idea of abandoning the capital does notstir the indignation of the bourgeoisie. Just the opposite. It isaccepted as a natural part of the general policy designed to promotecounter-revolutionary conspiracy. … Instead of recognising that thesalvation of the country lies in concluding peace, instead ofthrowing openly the idea of immediate peace to all the worn-outpeoples, over the heads of diplomats and imperialists, and making thecontinuation of the war impossible,—the Provisional Government, byorder of the Cadets, the Counter-Revolutionists and the AlliedImperialists, without sense, without purpose and without a plan,continues to drag on the murderous war, sentencing to useless deathnew hundreds of thousands of soldiers and sailors, and preparing togive up Petrograd, and to wreck the Revolution. At a time whenBolshevik soldiers and sailors are dying with other soldiers andsailors as a result of the mistakes and crimes of others, theso-called Supreme Commander (Kerensky) continues to suppress theBolshevik press. The leading parties of the Council are acting as avoluntary cover for these policies.“We, the faction of Social Democrats Bolsheviki, announce that withthis Government of Treason to the People we have nothing in common.We have nothing in common with the work of these Murderers of thePeople which goes on behind official curtains. We refuse eitherdirectly or indirectly to cover up one day of this work. WhileWilhelm’s troops are threatening Petrograd, the Government ofKerensky and Kornilov is preparing to run away from Petrograd andturn Moscow into a base of counter-revolution!“We warn the Moscow workers and soldiers to be on their guard.Leaving this Council, we appeal to the manhood and wisdom of theworkers, peasants and soldiers of all Russia. Petrograd is in danger!The Revolution is in danger! The Government has increased thedanger—the ruling classes intensify it. Only the people themselvescan save themselves and the country.“We appeal to the people. Long live immediate, honest, democraticpeace! All power to the Soviets! All land to the people! Long livethe Constituent Assembly!”                                 5.                        THE “NAKAZ” TO SKOBELIEV                                _Resumé_(Passed by the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and given to Skobeliev as an instructionfor the representative of the Russian Revolutionary democracy at theParis Conference.)The peace treaty must be based on the principle, “No annexations, noindemnities, the right of self-determination of peoples.”                _Territorial Problems_(1) Evacuation of German troops from invaded Russia. Full right ofself-determination to Poland, Lithuania and Livonia.(2) For Turkish Armenia autonomy, and later completeself-determination, as soon as local Governments are established.(3) The question of Alsace-Lorraine to be solved by a plebiscite,after the withdrawal of all foreign troops.(4) Belgium to be restored. Compensation for damages from aninternational fund.(5) Serbia and Montenegro to be restored, and aided by aninternational relief fund. Serbia to have an outlet on the Adriatic.Bosnia and Herzegovina to be autonomous.(6) The disputed provinces in the Balkans to have provisionalautonomy, followed by a plebiscite.(7) Rumania to be restored, but forced to give completeself-determination to the Dobrudja…. Rumania must be forced toexecute the clauses of the Berlin Treaty concerning the Jews, andrecognise them as Rumanian citizens.(8) In Italia Irridenta a provisional autonomy, followed by aplebiscite to determine state dependence.(9) The German colonies to be returned.(10) Greece and Persia to be restored.                _Freedom of the Seas_All straits opening into inland seas, as well as the Suez and PanamaCanals, are to be neutralised. Commercial shipping to be free. Theright of privateering to be abolished. The torpedoing of commercialships to be forbidden.                _Indemnities_All combatants to renounce demands for any indemnities, either director indirect—as, for instance, charges for the maintenance ofprisoners. Indemnities and contributions collected during the warmust be refunded.                _Economic Terms_Commercial treaties are not to be a part of the peace terms. Everycountry must be independent in its commercial relations, and must notbe obliged to, or prevented from, concluding an economic treaty, bythe Treaty of Peace. Nevertheless, all nations should bindthemselves, by the Peace Treaty, not to practise an economic blockadeafter the war, nor to form separate tariff agreements. The right ofmost favoured nation must be given to all countries withoutdistinction.                _Guarantees of Peace_Peace is to be concluded at the Peace Conference by delegates electedby the national representative institutions of each country. Thepeace terms are to be confirmed by these parliaments.Secret diplomacy is to be abolished; all parties are to bindthemselves not to conclude any secret treaties. Such treaties aredeclared in contradiction to international law, and void. Alltreaties, until confirmed by the parliaments of the differentnations, are to be considered void.Gradual disarmament both on land and sea, and the establishment of amilitia system. The “League of Nations” advanced by President Wilsonmay become a valuable aid to international law, provided that (a),all nations are to be obliged to participate in it with equal rights,and (b), international politics are to be democratised.                _Ways to Peace_The Allies are to announce immediately that they are willing to openpeace negotiations as soon as the enemy powers declare their consentto the renunciation of all forcible annexations.The Allies must bind themselves not to begin any peace negotiations,nor to conclude peace, except in a general Peace Conference with theparticipation of delegates from all the neutral countries.All obstacles to the Stockholm Socialist Conference are to beremoved, and passports are to be given immediately to all delegatesof parties and organisations who wish to participate.(The Executive Committee of the Peasants’ Soviets also issued a_nakaz,_ which differs little from the above.)                                 6.                        PEACE AT RUSSIA’S EXPENSEThe Ribot revelations of Austria’s peace-offer to France; theso-called “Peace Conference” at Berne, Switzerland, during the summerof 1917, in which delegates participated from all belligerentcountries, representing large financial interests in all thesecountries; and the attempted negotiations of an English agent with aBulgarian church dignitary; all pointed to the fact that there werestrong currents, on both sides, favourable to patching up a peace atthe expense of Russia. In my next book, “Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk,”I intend to treat this matter at some length, publishing severalsecret documents discovered in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs atPetrograd.                                 7.                     RUSSIAN SOLDIERS IN FRANCE_Official Report of the Provisional Government._“From the time the news of the Russian Revolution reached Paris,Russian newspapers of extreme tendencies immediately began to appear;and these newspapers, as well as individuals, freely circulated amongthe soldier masses and began a Bolshevik propaganda, often spreadingfalse news which appeared in the French journals. In the absence ofall official news, and of precise details, this campaign provokeddiscontent among the soldiers. The result was a desire to return toRussia, and a hatred toward the officers.“Finally it all turned into rebellion. In one of their meetings, thesoldiers issued an appeal to refuse to drill, since they had decidedto fight no more. It was decided to isolate the rebels, and GeneralZankievitch ordered all soldiers loyal to the Provisional Governmentto leave the camp of Courtine, and to carry with them all ammunition.On June 25th the order was executed; there remained at the camp onlythe soldiers who said they would submit ‘conditionally’ to theProvisional Government. The soldiers at the camp of Courtine receivedseveral times the visit of the Commander-in-Chief of the RussianArmies abroad, of Rapp, the Commissar of the Ministry of War, and ofseveral distinguished former exiles who wished to influence them, butthese attempts were unsuccessful, and finally Commissar Rapp insistedthat the rebels lay down their arms, and, in sign of submission,march in good order to a place called Clairvaux. The order was onlypartially obeyed; first 500 men went out, of whom 22 were arrested;24 hours later about 6,000 followed…. About 2,000 remained….“It was decided to increase the pressure; their rations werediminished, their pay was cut off, and the roads toward the villageof Courtine were guarded by French soldiers. General Zankievitch,having discovered that a Russian artillery brigade was passingthrough France, decided to form a mixed detachment of infantry andartillery to reduce the rebels. A deputation  was sent to the rebels;the deputation returned several hours later, convinced of thefutility of the negotiations. On September 1st General Zankievitchsent an ultimatum to the rebels demanding that they lay down theirarms, and menacing in case of refusal to open fire with artillery ifthe order was not obeyed by September 3d at 10 o’clock.“The order not being executed, a light fire of artillery was openedon the place at the hour agreed upon. Eighteen shells were fired, andthe rebels were warned that the bombardment would become moreintense. In the night of September 3d 160 men surrendered. September4th the artillery bombardment recommenced, and at 11 o’clock, after36 shells had been fired, the rebels raised two white flags and beganto leave the camp without arms. By evening 8,300 men had surrendered.150 soldiers who remained in the camp opened fire with machine-gunsthat night. The 5th of September, to make an end of the affair, aheavy barrage was laid on the camp, and our soldiers occupied itlittle by little. The rebels kept up a heavy fire with theirmachine-guns. September 6th, at 9 o’clock, the camp was entirelyoccupied…. After the disarmament of the rebels, 81 arrests weremade….”Thus the report. From secret documents discovered in the Ministry ofForeign Affairs, however, we know that the account is not strictlyaccurate. The first trouble arose when the soldiers tried to formCommittees, as their comrades in Russia were doing. They demanded tobe sent back to Russia, which was refused; and then, being considereda dangerous influence in France, they were ordered to Salonika. Theyrefused to go, and the battle followed…. It was discovered that theyhad been left in camp without officers for about two months, andbadly treated, before they became rebellious. All attempts to findout the name of the “Russian artillery brigade” which had fired onthem were futile; the telegrams discovered in the Ministry left it tobe inferred that French artillery was used….After their surrender, more than two hundred of the mutineers wereshot in cold blood.                                 8.                      TERESTCHENKO’S SPEECH_ (Resumé_)“… The questions of foreign policy are closely related to those ofnational defence…. And so, if in questions of national defence youthink it is necessary to hold session in secret, also in our foreignpolicy we are sometimes forced to observe the same secrecy….“German diplomacy attempts to influence public opinion…. Thereforethe declarations of directors of great democratic organisations whotalk loudly of a revolutionary Congress, and the impossibility ofanother winter campaign, are dangerous…. All these declarations costhuman lives….“I wish to speak merely of governmental logic, without touching thequestions of the honour and dignity of the State. From the point ofview of logic, the foreign policy of Russia ought to be based on areal comprehension of the _interests_ of Russia…. These interestsmean that it is impossible that our country remain alone, and thatthe present alignment of forces with us, (the Allies), issatisfactory…. All humanity longs for peace, but in Russia no onewill permit a humiliating peace which would violate the Stateinterests of our fatherland!”The orator pointed out that such a peace would for long years, if notfor centuries, retard the triumph of democratic principles in theworld, and would inevitably cause new wars.“All remember the days of May, when the fraternisation on our Frontthreatened to end the war by a simple cessation of militaryoperations, and lead the country to a shameful separate peace… andwhat efforts it was necessary to use to make the soldier masses atthe front understand that it was not by this method that the RussianState must end the war and guarantee its interest….”He spoke of the miraculous effect of the July offensive, whatstrength it gave to the words of Russian ambassadors abroad, and thedespair in Germany caused by the Russian victories. And also, thedisillusionment in Allied countries which followed the Russiandefeat….“As to the Russian Government, it adhered strictly to the formula ofMay, ‘No annexations and no punitive indemnities.’ We consider itessential not only to proclaim the self-determination of peoples, butalso to renounce imperialist aims….”Germany is continually trying to make peace. The only talk in Germanyis of peace; she knows she cannot win.“I reject the reproaches aimed at the Government which allege thatRussian foreign policy does not speak clearly enough about the aimsof the war….“If the question arises as to what ends the Allies are pursuing, itis indispensable first to demand what aims the Central Powers haveagreed upon….“The desire is often heard that we publish the details of thetreaties which bind the Allies; but people forget that, up to now, wedo not know the treaties which bind the Central Powers….”Germany, he said, evidently wants to separate Russia from the West bya series of weak buffer-states.“This tendency to strike at the vital interests of Russia must bechecked….“And will the Russian democracy, which has inscribed on its bannerthe rights of nations to dispose of themselves, allow calmly thecontinuation of oppression upon the most civilised peoples (inAustria-Hungary)?“Those who fear that the Allies will try to profit by our difficultsituation, to make us support more than our share of the burden ofwar, and to solve the questions of peace at our expense, are entirelymistaken…. Our enemy looks upon Russia as a market for its products.The end of the war will leave us in a feeble condition, and with ourfrontier open the flood of German products can easily hold back foryears our industrial development. Measures must be taken to guardagainst this….“I say openly and frankly: the combination of forces which unites usto the Allies is _favourable to the interests of Russia…._ It istherefore important that our views on the questions of war and peaceshall be in accord with the views of the Allies as clearly andprecisely as possible…. To avoid all misunderstanding, I must sayfrankly that Russia must present at the Paris Conference _one pointof view…._”He did not want to comment on the _nakaz_ to Skobeliev, but hereferred to the Manifesto of the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee, justpublished in Stockholm. This Manifesto declared for the autonomy ofLithuania and Livonia; “but that is clearly impossible,” saidTerestchenko, “for Russia must have free ports on the Baltic all theyear round….“In this question the problems of foreign policy are also closelyrelated to interior politics, for if there existed a strong sentimentof unity of all great Russia, one would not witness the repeatedmanifestations, everywhere, of a desire of peoples to separate fromthe Central Government…. Such separations are contrary to theinterests of Russia, and the Russian delegates cannot raise theissue….”                                 9.                       THE BRITISH FLEET (_etc._)At the time of the naval battle of the Gulf of Riga, not only theBolsheviki, but also the Ministers of the Provisional Government,considered  that the British Fleet had deliberately abandoned theBaltic, as one indication of the attitude so often expressed publiclyby the British press, and semi-publicly by British representatives inRussia, “Russia’s finished! No use bothering about Russia!”See interview with Kerensky (Appendix 13).GENERAL GURKO was a former Chief of Staff of the Russian armies underthe Tsar. He was a prominent figure in the corrupt Imperial Court.After the Revolution, he was one of the very few persons exiled forhis political and personal record. The Russian naval defeat in theGulf of Riga coincided with the public reception, by King George inLondon, of General Gurko, a man whom the Russian ProvisionalGovernment considered dangerously pro-German as well as reactionary!                                10.                     APPEALS AGAINST INSURRECTION                        _To Workers and Soldiers_“Comrades! The Dark Forces are increasingly trying to call forth inPetrograd and other towns DISORDERS AND _Pogroms._ Disorder isnecessary to the Dark Forces, for disorder will give them anopportunity for crushing the revolutionary movement in blood. Underthe pretext of establishing order, and of protecting the inhabitants,they hope to establish the domination of Kornilov, which therevolutionary people succeeded in suppressing not long ago. Woe tothe people if these hopes are realised! The triumphantcounter-revolution will destroy the Soviets and the Army Committees,will disperse the Constituent Assembly, will stop the transfer of theland to the Land Committees, will put an end to all the hopes of thepeople for a speedy peace, and will fill all the prisons withrevolutionary soldiers and workers.“In their calculations, the counter-revolutionists and Black Hundredleaders are counting on the serious discontent of the unenlightenedpart of the people with the disorganisation of the food-supply, thecontinuation of the war, and the general difficulties of life. Theyhope to transform every demonstration of soldiers and workers into a_pogrom,_ which will frighten the peaceful population and throw itinto the arms of the Restorers of Law and Order.“Under such conditions every attempt to organise a demonstration inthese days, although for the most laudable object, would be a crime.All conscious workers and soldiers who are displeased with the policyof the Government will only bring injury to themselves and to theRevolution if they indulge in demonstrations.“THEREFORE THE _Tsay-ee-kah_ ASKS ALL WORKERS NOT TO OBEY ANY CALLSTO DEMONSTRATE.“WORKERS AND SOLDIERS! DO NOT YIELD TO PROVOCATION! REMEMBER YOURDUTY TO YOUR COUNTRY AND TO THE REVOLUTION! DO NOT BREAK THE UNITY OFTHE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT BY DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH ARE BOUND TO BEUNSUCCESSFUL!”_The Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Workers’ andSoldiers’ Deputies (Tsay-ee-kah)__Russian Social Democratic Labour Party_THE DANGER IS NEAR!To All Workers and Soldiers(_Read and Hand to Others_)_Comrades Workers and Soldiers!_“Our country is in danger. On account of this danger our freedom andour Revolution are passing through difficult days. The enemy is atthe gates of Petrograd. The disorganisation is growing with everyhours. It becomes more and more difficult to obtain bread forPetrograd. All, of from the smallest to the greatest, must redoubletheir efforts, must endeavour to arrange things properly…. We mustsave our country, say freedom…. More arms and provisions for theArmy! Bread—for the great cities. Order and organisation in thecountry….“And in these terrible critical days rumours creep about thatSOMEWHERE a demonstration is being prepared, that SOME ONE is callingon the soldiers and workers to destroy revolutionary peace andorder…. _Rabotchi Put,_ the newspaper of the Bolsheviki, is pouringoil on the flames: it flattering, trying to please the unenlightenedpeople, tempting the worker and soldiers, urging them on against theGovernment, promising them mountains of good things…. The confiding,ignorant men believe, they do not reason…. And from the other sidecome also rumours—rumours that the Dark Forces, the friends of theTsar, the German spies, are rubbing their hands with glee. They areready to join the Bolsheviki, and with them fan the disorders intocivil war.“The Bolsheviki and the ignorant soldiers and workers seduced by themcry senselessly: ‘Down with the Government! All power to theSoviets!’ And the Dark servants of the Tsar and the spies of Wilhelmwill egg the on; ‘Beat the Jews, beat the shopkeepers, rob themarkets, devastate the shops, pillage the wine stores! Slay, burn,rob!’“And then will begin a terrible confusion, a war between one part ofthe people and the other. All will become still more disorganised,and perhaps once more blood will be shed on the streets of thecapital. And then what then?“Then, the road to Petrograd will be open to Wilhelm. Then, no breadwill come to Petrograd, the children will die of hunger. Then, theArmy as the front will remain without support, our brothers in thetrenches will be delivered to the fire of the enemy. Then, Russiawill lose all prestige in other countries, our money will lose itsvalue; everything will be so dear as to make life impossible. Then,the long awaited Constituent Assembly will be postponed—it will beimpossible to convene it in time. And then—Death to the Revolution,Death to our Liberty….“Is it this that you want, workers and soldiers? No! If you do notthen go, go to the ignorant people seduced by the betrayers, and tellthem the whole truth, which we have told you!“Let all know that EVERY MAN WHO IN THESE TERRIBLE DAYS CALLS ON YOUTO COME OUT IN THE STREETS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, IS EITHER A SECRETSERVANT OF THE TSAR, A PROVOCATOR, OR AN UNWISE ASSISTANT OF THEENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE, OR A PAID SPY OF WILHELM!“Every conscious worker revolutionist, every conscious peasant, everyrevolutionary soldier, all who understand what harm a demonstrationor a revolt against the Government might cause to the people, mustjoin together and not allow the enemies of the people to destroy ourfreedom.”_The Petrograd Electoral Committee of the Mensheviki-oborontzi._                                11.                    LENIN’s “LETTER TO THE COMRADES”This series of articles appeared in _Rabotchi Put_ several daysrunning, at the end of October and beginning of November, 1917. Igive here only extracts from two instalments:1. Kameniev and Riazanov say that we have not a majority among thepeople, and that without a majority insurrection is hopeless.“Answer: People capable of speaking such things are falsifiers,pedants, or simply don’t want to look the real situation in the face.In the last elections we received in all the country more than fiftyper cent of all thevotes….“The most important thing in Russia to-day is the peasants’revolution. In Tambov Government there has been a real agrarianuprising with wonderful political results…. Even _Dielo Naroda_ hasbeen scared into yelling that the land must be turned over to thepeasants, and not only the Socialist Revolutionaries in the Councilof the Republic, but also the Government itself, has been similarlyaffected. Another valuable result was the bringing of bread which hadbeen hoarded by the _pomieshtchiki_ to the railroad stations in thatprovince. The _Russkaya Volia_ had to admit that the stations werefilled with bread after the peasants’ rising….“2. We are not sufficiently strong to take over the Government, andthe bourgeoisie is not sufficiently strong to prevent the ConstituentAssembly.“Answer: This is nothing but timidity, expressed by pessimism asregards workers and soldiers, and optimism as regards the failure ofthe bourgeoisie. If _yunkers_ and Cossacks say they will fight, youbelieve them; if workmen and soldiers say so, you doubt it. What isthe distinction between such doubts and siding politically with thebourgeoisie?“Kornilov proved that the Soviets were really a power. To believeKerensky and the Council of the Republic, if the bourgeoisie is notstrong enough to break the Soviets, it is not strong enough to breakthe Constituent. But that is wrong. The bourgeoisie will break theConstituent by sabotage, by lock-outs, by giving up Petrograd, byopening the front to the Germans. This has already been done in thecase of Riga….“3. The Soviets must remain a revolver at the head of the Governmentto force the calling of the Constituent Assembly, and to suppress anyfurther Kornilov attempts.“Answer: Refusal of insurrection is refusal of ‘All Power to theSoviets.’ Since September the Bolshevik party has been discussing thequestion of insurrection. Refusing to rise means to trust our hopesin the faith of the good bourgeoisie, who have ‘promised’ to call theConstituent Assembly. When the Soviets have all the power, thecalling of the Constituent is guaranteed, and its success assured.“Refusal of insurrection means surrender to the ‘Lieber-Dans.’ Eitherwe must drop ‘All Power to the Soviets’ or make an insurrection;there is no middle course.”“4. The bourgeoisie cannot give up Petrograd, although the Rodziankoswant it, because it is not the bourgeoisie who are fighting, but ourheroic soldiers and sailors.“Answer: This did not prevent two admirals from running away at theMoonsund battle. The Staff has not changed; it is composed ofKornilovtsi. If the Staff, with Kerensky at its head, wants to giveup Petrograd, it can do it doubly or trebly. It can make arrangementswith the Germans or the British; open the fronts. It can sabotage theArmy’s food supply. At all these doors has it knocked.“We have no right to wait until the bourgeoisie chokes theRevolution. Rodzianko is a man of action, who has faithfully andtruthfully served the bourgeoisie for years…. Half the Lieber-Dansare cowardly compromisers; half of them simple fatalists….”“5. We’re getting stronger every day. We shall be able to enter theConstituent Assembly as a strong opposition. Then why should we playeverything on one card?”“Answer: This is the argument of a sophomore with no practicalexperience, who reads that the Constituent Assembly is being calledand trustfully accepts the legal and constitutional way. Even thevoting of the Constituent Assembly will not do away with hunger, orbeat Wilhelm…. The issue of hunger and of surrendering Petrogradcannot be decided by waiting for the Constituent Assembly. Hunger isnot waiting. The peasants’ Revolution is not waiting. The Admiralswho ran away did not wait.“Blind people are surprised that hungry people, betrayed by admiralsand generals, do not take an interest in voting.“6. If the Kornilovtsi make an attempt, we would show them ourstrength. But why should we risk everything by making an attemptourselves?“Answer: History doesn’t repeat. ‘Perhaps Kornilov will some day makean attempt!’ What a serious base for proletarian action! But supposeKornilov waits for starvation, for the opening of the fronts, whatthen? This attitude means to build the tactics of a revolutionaryparty on one of the bourgeoisie’s former mistakes.“Let us forget everything except that there is no way out but by thedictatorship of the proletariat—either that or the dictatorship ofKornilov.“Let us wait, comrades, for—a miracle!”                                12.                      MILIUKOV’s SPEECH (_Resumé_)“Every one admits, it seems, that the defence of the country is ourprincipal task, and that, to assure it, we must have discipline inthe Army and order in the rear. To achieve this, there must be apower capable of daring, not only by persuasion, but also by force….The germ of all our evils comes from the point of view, original,truly Russian, concerning foreign policy, which passes for theInternationalist point of view.“The noble Lenin only imitates the noble Keroyevsky when he holdsthat from Russia will come the New World which shall resuscitate theaged West, and which will replace the old banner of doctrinarySocialism by the new direct action of starving masses—and that willpush humanity forward and force it to break in the doors of thesocial paradise….”These men sincerely believed that the decomposition of Russia wouldbring about the decomposition of the whole capitalist régime.Starting from that point of view, they were able to commit theunconscious treason, in wartime, of calmly telling the soldiers toabandon the trenches, and instead of fighting the external enemy,creating internal civil war and attacking the proprietors andcapitalists….Here Miliukov was interrupted by furious cries from the Left,demanding what Socialist had ever advised such action….“Martov says that only the revolutionary pressure of the proletariatcan condemn and conquer the evil will of imperialist cliques andbreak down the dictatorship of these cliques…. Not by an accordbetween Governments for a limitation of armaments, but by thedisarming of these Governments and the radical democratisation of themilitary system….”He attacked Martov viciously, and then turned on the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries, whom he accused of entering the Governmentas Ministers with the avowed purpose of carrying on the classstruggle!“The Socialists of Germany and of the Allied countries contemplatedthese gentlemen with ill-concealed contempt, but they decided that itwas for Russia, and sent us some apostles of the UniversalConflagration….“The formula of our democracy is very simple; no foreign policy, noart of diplomacy, an immediate democratic peace, a declaration to theAllies, ‘We want nothing, we haven’t anything to fight with!’ Andthen our adversaries will make the same declaration, and thebrotherhood of peoples will be accomplished!”Miliukov took a fling at the Zimmerwald Manifesto, and declared thateven Kerensky has not been able to escape the influence of “thatunhappy document which will forever be your indictment.” He thenattacked Skobeliev, whose position in foreign assemblies, where hewould appear as a Russian delegate, yet opposed to the foreign policyof his Government, would be so strange that people would say, “What’sthat gentleman carrying, and what shall we talk to him about?” As forthe _nakaz,_ Miliukov said that he himself was a pacifist; that hebelieved in the creation of an International Arbitration Board, andthe necessity for a limitation of armaments, and parliamentarycontrol over secret diplomacy, which did not mean the abolition ofsecret diplomacy.As for the Socialist ideas in the _nakaz,_ which he called “Stockholmideas”—peace without victory, the right of self-determination ofpeoples, and renunciation of the economic war—“The German successes are directly proportionate to the successes ofthose who call themselves the revolutionary democracy. I do not wishto say, ‘to the successes of the Revolution,’ because I believe thatthe defeats of the revolutionary democracy are victories for theRevolution….“The influence of the Soviet leaders abroad is not unimportant. Onehad only to listen to the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairsto be convinced that, in this hall, the influence of therevolutionary democracy on foreign policy is so strong, that theMinister does not dare to speak face to face with it about the honourand dignity of Russia!“We can see, in the _nakaz_ of the Soviets, that the ideas of theStockholm Manifesto have been elaborated in two direction—that ofUtopianism, and that of German interests….Interrupted by the angry cries of the Left, and rebuked by thePresident, Miliukov insisted that the proposition of peace concludedby popular assemblies, not by diplomats, and the proposal toundertake peace negotiations as soon as the enemy had renouncedannexations, were pro-German. Recently Kuhlman said that a personaldeclaration bound only him who made it…. “Anyway, we will imitate theGermans before we will imitate the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’Deputies….”The sections treating of the independence of Lithuania and Livoniawere symptoms of nationalist agitation in different parts of Russia,supported, said Miliukov, by German money…. Amid bedlam from theLeft, he contrasted the clauses of the _nakaz_ concerningAlsace-Lorraine, Rumania, and Serbia, with those treating of thenationalities in Germany and Austria. The _nakaz_ embraced the Germanand Austrian point of view, said Miliukov.Passing to Terestchenko’s speech, he contemptuously accused him ofbeing afraid to speak the thought in his mind, and even afraid tothink in terms of the greatness of Russia. The Dardanelles mustbelong to Russia….“You are continually saying that the soldier does not know why he isfighting, and that when he does know, he’ll fight…. It is true thatthe soldier doesn’t know why he is fighting, but now you have toldhim that there is no reason for him to fight, that we have nonational interests, and that we are fighting for alien ends….”Paying tribute to the Allies, who, he said, with the assistance ofAmerica, “will yet save the cause of humanity,” he ended:“Long live the light of humanity, the advanced democracies of theWest, who for a long time have been travelling the way we now onlybegin to enter, with ill-assured and hesitating steps! Long live ourbrave Allies!”                                13.                        INTERVIEW WITH KERENSKYThe Associated Press man tried his hand. “Mr. Kerensky,” he began,“in England and France people are disappointed with the Revolution——”“Yes, I know,” interrupted Kerensky, quizzically. “Abroad theRevolution is no longer fashionable!”“What is your explanation of why the Russians have stopped fighting?”“That is a foolish question to ask.” Kerensky was annoyed. “Russiaentered the war first of all the Allies, and for a long time she borethe whole brunt of it. Her losses have been inconceivably greaterthan those of all the other nations put together. Russia has now theright to demand of the Allies that they bring greater force of armsto bear.” He stopped for a moment and stared at his interlocutor.“You are asking why the Russians have stopped fighting, and theRussians are asking where is the British fleet—with Germanbattle-ships in the Gulf of Riga?” Again he ceased suddenly, and assuddenly burst out. “The Russian Revolution hasn’t failed and therevolutionary Army hasn’t failed. It is not the Revolution whichcaused disorganisation in the army—that disorganisation wasaccomplished years ago, by the old regime. Why aren’t the Russiansfighting? I will tell you. Because the masses of the people areeconomically exhausted,—and because they are disillusioned with theAllies!”The interview of which this is an excerpt was cabled to the UnitedStates, and in a few days sent back by the American State Department,with a demand that it be “altered.” This Kerensky refused to do; butit was done by his secretary, Dr. David Soskice—and, thus purged ofall offensive references to the Allies, was given to the press of theworld….                      APPENDIX TO CHAPTER III                                 1.                RESOLUTION OF THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES                        _Workers’ Control_1. (See Ppage 43)2. The organisation of Workers’ Control is a manifestation of thesame healthy activity in the sphere of industrial production, as areparty organisations in the sphere of politics, trade unions inemployment, Cooperatives in the domain of consumption, and literaryclubs in the sphere of culture.3. The working-class has much more interest in the proper anduninterrupted operation of factories… than the capitalist class.Workers’ Control is a better security in this respect for theinterests of modern society, of the whole people, than the arbitrarywill of the owners, who are guided only by their selfish desire formaterial profits or political privileges. Therefore Workers’ Controlis demanded by the proletariat not only in their own interest, but inthe interest of the whole country, and should be supported by therevolutionary peasantry as well as the revolutionary Army.4. Considering the hostile attitude of the majority of the capitalistclass toward the Revolution, experience shows that properdistribution of raw materials and fuel, as well as the most efficientmanagement of factories, is impossible without Workers’ Control.5. Only Workers’ Control over capitalist enterprises, cultivating theworkers’ conscious attitude toward work, and making clear its socialmeaning, can create conditions favourable to the development of afirm self-discipline in labour, and the development of all labour’spossible productivity.6. The impending transformation of industry from a war to a peacebasis, and the redistribution of labour all over the country, as wellas among the different factories, can be accomplished without greatdisturbances only by means of the democratic self-government of theworkers themselves…. Therefore the realisation of Workers’ Control isan indispensable preliminary to the demobilisation of industry.7. In accordance with the slogan proclaimed by the Russian SocialDemocratic Labour Party (Bolsheviki), Workers’ Control on a nationalscale, in order to bring results, must extend to all capitalistconcerns, and not be organised accidentally, without system; it mustbe well-planned, and not separated from the industrial life of thecountry as a whole.8. The economic life of the country—agriculture, industry, commerceand transport—must be subjected to one unified plan, constructed soas to satisfy the individual and social requirements of the widemasses of the people; it must be approved by their electedrepresentatives, and carried out under the direction of theserepresentatives by means of national and local organisations.9. That part of the plan which deals with land-labour must be carriedout under supervision of the peasants’ and land-workers’organisations; that relating to industry, trade and transportoperated by wage-earners, by means of Workers’ Control; the naturalorgans of Workers’ Control inside the industrial plant will be theFactory-Shop and similar Committees; and in the labour market, theTrade Unions.10. The collective wage agreements arranged by the Trade Unions forthe majority of workers in any branch of labour, must be binding onall the owners of plants employing this kind of labour in the givendistrict.11. Employment bureaus must be placed under the control andmanagement of the Trade Unions, as class organisations acting withinthe limits of the whole industrial plan, and in accordance with it.12. Trade Unions must have the right, upon their own initiative, tobegin legal action against all employers who violate labour contractsor labour legislation, and also in behalf of any individual worker inany branch of labour.13. On all questions relating to Workers’ Control over production,distribution and employment, the Trade Unions must confer with theworkers of individual establishments through their Factory-ShopCommittees.14. Matters of employment and discharge, vacations, wage scales,refusal of work, degree of productivity and skill, reasons forabrogating agreements, disputes with the administration, and similarproblems of the internal life of the factory, must be settledexclusively according to the findings of the Factory-Shop Committee,which has the right to exclude from participation in the discussionany members of the factory administration.15. The Factory-Shop Committee forms a commission to control thesupplying of the factory with raw materials, fuel, orders, labourpower and technical staff (including equipment), and all othersupplies and arrangements, and also to assure the factory’s adherenceto the general industrial plan. The factory administration is obligedto surrender to the organs of Workers’ Control, for their aid andinformation, all data concerning the business; to make it possible toverify this data, and to produce the books of the company upon demandof the Factory-Shop Committee.16. Any illegal acts on the part of the administration discovered bythe Factory-Shop Committees, or any suspicion of such illegal acts,which cannot be investigated or remedied by the workers alone, shallbe referred to the district central organisation of Factory-ShopCommittees charged with the particular branch of labour involved,which shall discuss the matter with the institutions charged with theexecution of the general industrial plan, and find means to deal withthe matter, even to the extent of confiscating the factory.17. The union of the Factory-Shop Committees of different concernsmust be accomplished on the basis of the different trades, in orderto facilitate control over the whole branch of industry, so as tocome within the general industrial plan; and so as to create aneffective plan of distribution among the different factories oforders, raw materials, fuel, technical and labour power; and also tofacilitate cooperation with the Trade Unions, which are organised bytrades.18. The central city councils of Trade Unions and Factory-ShopCommittees represent the proletariat in the corresponding provincialand  local institutions formed to elaborate and carry out the generalindustrial plan, and to organise economic relations between the townsand the villages (workers and peasants). They also possess finalauthority for the management of Factory-Shop Committees and TradeUnions, so far as Workers’ Control in their district is concerned,and they shall issue obligatory regulations concerning workers’discipline in the routine of production—which regulations, however,must be approved by vote of the workers themselves.                                 2.                THE BOURGEOIS PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI_Russkaya Volia,_ October 28. “The decisive moment approaches…. It isdecisive for the Bolsheviki. Either they will give us… a secondedition of the events of July 16-18, or they will have to admit thatwith their plans and intentions, with their impertinent policy ofwishing to separate themselves from everything consciously national,they have been definitely defeated….“What are the chances of Bolshevik success?“It is difficult to answer that question, for their principal supportis the… ignorance of the popular masses. They speculate on it, theywork upon it by a demagogy which nothing can stop….“The Government must play its part in this affair. Supporting itselfmorally by the Council of the Republic, the Government must take aclearly-defined attitude toward the Bolsheviki….“And if the Bolsheviki provoke an insurrection against the legalpower, and thus facilitate the German invasion, they must be treatedas mutineers and traitors….”_Birzhevya Viedomosti,_ October 28. “Now that the Bolsheviki haveseparated themselves from the rest of the democracy, the struggleagainst them is very much simpler—and it is not reasonable, in orderto fight against Bolshevism, to wait until they make a manifestation.The Government should not even allow the manifestation….“The appeals of the Bolsheviki to insurrection and anarchy are actspunishable by the criminal courts, and in the freest countries, theirauthors would receive severe sentences. For what the Bolsheviki arecarrying on is not a political struggle against the Government, oreven for the power; it is propaganda for anarchy, massacres, andcivil war. This propaganda must be extirpated at its roots; it wouldbe strange to wait, in order to begin action against an agitation for_pogroms,_ until the _pogroms_ actually occurred….”_Novoye Vremya,_ November 1. “hellip; Why is the Government excitedonly about November 2d (date of calling of the Congress of Soviets),and not about September 12th, or October 3d?“This is not the first time that Russia burns and falls in ruins, andthat the smoke of the terrible conflagration makes the eyes of ourAllies smart….“Since it came to power, has there been a single order issued by theGovernment for the purpose of halting anarchy, or has any oneattempted to put out the Russian conflagration?“There were other things to do….“The Government turned its attention to a more immediate problem. Itcrushed an insurrection (the Kornilov attempt) concerning which everyone is now asking, ‘Did it ever exist?”                                 3.                MODERATE SOCIALIST PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI_Dielo Naroda,_ October 28 (Socialist Revolutionary). “The mostfrightful crime of the Bolsheviki against the Revolution is that theyimpute  exclusively to the bad intentions of the revolutionaryGovernment all the calamities which the masses are so cruellysuffering; when as a matter of fact these calamities spring fromobjective causes.“They make golden promises to the masses, knowing in advance thatthey can fulfil none of them; they lead the masses on a false trail,deceiving them as to the source of all their troubles….“The Bolsheviki are the most dangerous enemies of the Revolution….”_Dien,_ October 30 (Menshevik). “Is this really ‘the freedom of thepress’? Every day _Novaya Rus_ and _Rabotchi Put_ openly incite toinsurrection. Every day these two papers commit in their columnsactual crimes. Every day they urge _pogroms_…. Is that ‘the freedomof the press’?…“The Government ought to defend itself and defend us. We have theright to insist that the Government machinery does not remain passivewhile the threat of bloody riots endangers the lives of itscitizens….”                                 4.                            “YEDINSTVO”Plekhanov’s paper, _Yedinstvo,_ suspended publication a few weeksafter the Bolsheviki seized the power. Contrary to popular report,_Yedinstvo_ was not suppressed by the Soviet Government; anannouncement in the last number admitted that it was unable tocontinue _because there were too few subscribers_….                                 5.                WERE THE BOLSHEVIKI CONSPIRATORS?The French newspaper _Entente_ of Petrograd, on November 15th,published an article of which the following is a part:“The Government of Kerensky discusses and hesitates. The Governmentof Lenin and Trotzky attacks and acts.“This last is called a Government of Conspirators, but that is wrong.Government of usurpers, yes, like all revolutionary Governments whichtriumph over their adversaries. Conspirators—no!“No! They did not conspire. On the contrary, openly, audaciously,without mincing words, without dissimulating their intentions, theymultiplied their agitation, intensified their propaganda in thefactories, the barracks, at the Front, in the country, everywhere,even fixing in advance the date of their taking up arms, the date oftheir seizure of the power….“_They_—conspirators? Never….”                                 6.                    APPEAL AGAINST INSURRECTION                _From the Central Army Committee_“… Above everything we insist upon the inflexible execution of theorganised will of the majority of the people, expressed by theProvisional Government in accord with the Council of the Republic andthe _Tsay-ee-kah,_ as organ of the popular power….“Any demonstration to depose this power by violence, at a moment whena Government crisis will infallibly create disorganisation, the ruinof the country, and civil war, will be considered by the Army as acounter-revolutionary act, and repressed by force of arms….“The interests of private groups and classes should be submitted to asingle interest—that of augmenting industrial production, anddistributing the necessities of life with fairness….“All who are capable of sabotage, disorganisation, or disorder, alldeserters, all slackers, all looters, should be forced to doauxiliary service in the rear of the Army….“We invite the Provisional Government to form, out of these violatorsof the people’s will, these enemies of the Revolution, labourdetachments to work in the rear, on the Front, in the trenches underenemy fire….”                                 7.                EVENTS OF THE NIGHT, NOVEMBER 6THToward evening bands of Red Guards began to occupy the printing shopsof the bourgeois press, where they printed _Rabotchi Put, Soldat,_and various proclamations by the hundred thousand. The City Militiawas ordered to clear these places, but found the offices barricaded,and armed men defending them. Soldiers who were ordered to attack theprint-shops refused.About midnight a Colonel with a company of _yunkers_ arrived at theclub “Free Mind,” with a warrant to arrest the editor of _RabotchiPut._ Immediately an enormous mob gathered in the street outside andthreatened to lynch the _yunkers._ The Colonel thereupon begged thathe and the _yunkers_ be arrested and taken to Peter-Paul prison forsafety. This request was granted.At 1 A. M. a detachment of soldiers and sailors from Smolny occupiedthe Telegraph Agency. At 1.35 the Post Office was occupied. Towardmorning the Military Hotel was taken, and at 5 o’clock the TelephoneExchange. At dawn the State Bank was surrounded. And at 10 A. M. acordon of troops was drawn about the Winter Palace.                       APPENDIX TO CHAPTER IV                                 1.                        EVENTS OF NOVEMBER 7THFrom 4 A. M. until dawn Kerensky remained at the Petrograd StaffHeadquarters, sending orders to the Cossacks and to the _yunkers_ inthe Officers’ Schools in and around Petrograd—all of whom answeredthat they were unable to move.Colonel Polkovnikov, Commandant of the City, hurried between theStaff and the Winter Palace, evidently without any plan. Kerenskygave an order to open the bridges; three hours passed without anyaction, and then an officer and five men went out on their owninitiative, and putting to flight a picket of Red Guards, opened theNicolai Bridge. Immediately after they left, however, some sailorsclosed it again.Kerensky ordered the print-shop of _Rabotchi Put_ to be occupied. Theofficer detailed to the work was promised a squad of soldiers; twohours later he was promised some _yunkers;_ then the order wasforgotten.An attempt was made to recapture the Post Office and the TelegraphAgency; a few shots were fired, and the Government troops announcedthat they would no longer oppose the Soviets.To a delegation of _yunkers_ Kerensky said, “As chief of theProvisional Government and as Supreme Commander I know nothing, Icannot advise you; but as a veteran revolutionist, I appeal to you,young revolutionists, to remain at your posts and defend theconquests of the Revolution.”Orders of Kishkin, November 7th:“By decree of the Provisional Government…. I am invested withextraordinary powers for the reestablishment of order in Petrograd,in complete command of all civil and military authorities….”“In accordance with the powers conferred upon me by the ProvisionalGovernment, I herewith relieve from his functions as Commandant ofthe Petrograd Military District Colonel George Polkovnikov….”                        *     *     *     *     *_Appeal to the Population_ signed by Vice-Premier Konovalov, November7th:“Citizens!

A telegram has been sent to the_Stavka;_ and an answer received says that a strong detachment oftroops is being sent….“Let the Army and the People reject the irresponsible attempts of theBolsheviki to create a revolt in the rear….”About 9 A. M. Kerensky left for the Front….Toward evening two soldiers on bicycles presented themselves at theStaff Headquarters, as delegates of the garrison of Peter-PaulFortress. Entering the meeting-room of the Staff, where Kishkin,Rutenburg, Paltchinski, General Bagratouni, Colonel Paradielov andCount Tolstoy were gathered, they demanded the immediate surrender ofthe Staff; threatening, in case of refusal, to bombard headquarters….After two panicky conferences the Staff retreated to the WinterPalace, and the headquarters were occupied by Red Guards….Late in the afternoon several Bolshevik armoured cars cruised aroundthe Palace Square, and Soviet soldiers tried unsuccessfully to parleywith the _yunkers_….Firing on the Palace began about 7 o’clock in the evening….At 10 P. M. began an artillery bombardment from three sides, in whichmost of the shells were blanks, only three small shrapnels strikingthe facade of the Palace….                                 2.                        KERENSKY IN FLIG{HT  -ed.}Leaving Petrograd in the morning of November 7th, Kerensky arrived byautomobile at Gatchina, where he demanded a special train. Towardevening he was in Ostrov, Province of Pskov. The next morning,extraordinary  session of the local Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’Depulies, with participation of Cossack delegates—there being 6,000Cossacks at Ostrov.Kerensky spoke to the assembly, appealing for aid against theBolsheviki, and addressed himself almost exclusively to the Cossacks.The soldier delegates protested.“Why did you come here?” shouted voices. Kerensky answered, “To askthe Cossacks’ assistance in crushing the Bolshevik insurrection!” Atthis there were violent protestations, which increased when hecontinued, “I broke the Kornilov attempt, and I will break theBolsheviki!” The noise became so great that he had to leave theplatform….The soldier deputies and the Ussuri Cossacks decided to arrestKerensky, but the Don Cossacks prevented them, and got him away bytrain…. A Military Revolutionary Committee, set up during the day,tried to inform the garrison of Pskov; but the telephone andtelegraph lines were cut….Kerensky did not arrive at Pskov. Revolutionary soldiers had cut therailway line, to prevent troops being sent against the capital. Onthe night of November 8th he arrived by automobile at Luga, where hewas well received by the Death Battalions stationed there.Next day he took train for the South-West Front, and visited the ArmyCommittee at headquarters. The Fifth Army, however, was wild withenthusiasm over the news of the Bolshevik success, and the ArmyCommittee was unable to promise Kerensky any support.From there he went to the _Stavka,_ at Moghilev, where he ordered tenregiments from different parts of the Front to move againstPetrograd. The soldiers almost unanimously refused; and thoseregiments which did start halted on the way. About five thousandCossacks finally followed him….                                 3.                    LOOTING OF THE WINTER PALACEI do not mean to maintain that there was no looting, in the WinterPalace. Both after and _before_ the Winter Palace fell, there wasconsiderable pilfering. The statement of the Socialist Revolutionarypaper _Narod,_ and of members of the City Duma, to the effect thatprecious objects to the value of 500,000,000 rubles had been stolen,was, however, a gross exaggeration.The most important art treasures of the Palace—paintings, statues,tapestries, rare porcelains and armorie,—had been transferred toMoscow during the month of September; and they were still in goodorder in the basement of the Imperial Palace there ten days after thecapture of the Kremlin by Bolshevik troops. I can personally testifyto this….Individuals, however, especially the general public, which wasallowed to circulate freely through the Winter Palace for severaldays after its capture, made away with table silver, clocks, bedding,mirrors and some odd vases of valuable porcelain and semi-preciousstone, to the value of about $50,000.The Soviet Government immediately created a special commission,composed of artists and archæologists, to recover the stolen objects.On November 1st two proclamations were issued:                        “CITIZENS OF PETROGRAD!“We urgently ask all citizens to exert every effort to find whateverpossible of the objects stolen from the Winter Palace in the night ofNovember 7-8, and to forward them to the Commandant of the WinterPalace.“Receivers of stolen goods, antiquarians, and all who are proved tobe hiding such objects will be held legally responsible and punishedwith all severity.“_Commissars for the Protection of Museums and Artistic Collections,_                                “G.

MANDELBAUM.”About half the loot was recovered, some of it in the baggage offoreigners leaving Russia.A conference of artists and archæologists, held at the suggestion ofSmolny, appointed a commission of make an inventory of the WinterPalace treasures, which was given complete charge of the Palace andof all artistic collections and State museums in Petrograd. OnNovember 16th the Winter Palace was closed to the public while theinventory was being made….During the last week in November a decree was issued by the Councilof People’s Commissars, changing the name of the Winter Palace to“People’s Museum,” entrusting it to the complete charge of theartistic-archæological commission, and declaring that henceforth allGovernmental activities within its wall were prohibited….                                 4.                    RAPE OF THE WOMEN’S BATTALIONImmediately following the taking of the Winter Palace all sorts ofsensational stories were published in the anti-Bolshevik press, andtold in the City Duma, about the fate of the Women’s Battaliondefending the Palace. It was said that some of the girl-soldiers hadbeen thrown from the windows into the street, most of the rest hadbeen violated, and many had committed suicide as a result of thehorrors they had gone through.The City Duma appointed a commission to investigate the matter. OnNovember 16th the commission returned from Levashovo, headquarters ofthe Women’s Battalion. Madame Tyrkova reported that the girls hadbeen at first taken to the barracks of the Pavlovsky Regiment, andthat there some of them had been badly treated; but that at presentmost of them were at Levashovo, and the rest scattered about the cityin private houses. Dr. Mandelbaum, another of the commission,testified drily that _none_ of the women had been thrown out of thewindows of the Winter Palace, that _none_ were wounded, that threehad been violated, and that one had committed suicide, leaving a notewhich said that she had been “disappointed in her ideals.”On November 21st the Military Revolutionary Committee officiallydissolved the Women’s Battalion, at the request of the girlsthemselves, who returned to civilian clothes.In Louise Bryant’s book, “Six Red Months in Russia,” there is aninteresting description of the girl-soldiers during this time.                        APPENDIX TO CHAPTER V                                 1.                        APPEALS AND PROCLAMATIONS_From the Military Revolutionary Committee,_ November 8:“To All Army Committees and All Soviets of Soldiers’ Deputies.“The Petrograd garrison has overturned the Government of Kerensky,which had risen against the Revolution and the People…. In sendingthis news to the Front and the country, the Military RevolutionaryCommittee requests all soldiers to keep vigilant watch on the conductof officers. Officers who do not frankly and openly declare for theRevolution should be immediately arrested as enemies.“The Petrograd Soviet interprets the programme of the new Governmentas: immediate proposals of a general democratic peace, the immediatetransfer of great landed estates to the peasants, and the honestconvocation of the Constituent Assembly. The people’s revolutionaryArmy must not permit troops of doubtful morale to be sent toPetrograd. Act by means of arguments, by means of moral suasion—butif that fails, halt the movement of troops by implacable force.“The present order must be immediately read to all military units ofevery branch of the service. Whoever keeps the knowledge of thisorder from the soldier-masses…. commits a serious crime against theRevolution, and will be punished with all the rigour of revolutionarylaw.“Soldiers!

The presidents of the variouslocal Soviets are invited to enter into direct relations with therevolutionary Government.”                                _Military Revolutionary Committee._                                 2.                PROTEST OF THE MUNICIPAL DUMA“The Central City Duma, elected on the most democratic principles,has undertaken the burden of managing Municipal affairs and foodsupplies at the time of the greatest disorganisation. At the presentmoment the Bolshevik party, three weeks before the elections to theConstituent Assembly, and in spite of the menace of the externalenemy, having removed by armed force the only legal revolutionaryauthority, is making an attempt against the rights and independenceof the Municipal Self-Government, demanding submission to itsCommissars and its illegal authority.“In this terrible and tragic moment the Petrograd City Duma, in theface of its constituents, and of all Russia, declares loudly that itwill not submit to any encroachments on its rights and itsindependence, and will remain at the post of responsibility to whichit has been called by the will of the population of the capital.“The Central City Duma of Petrograd appeals to all Dumas and Zemstvosof the Russian Republic to rally to the defence of one of thegreatest conquests of the Russian Revolution—the independence andinviolability of popular self-government.”                                 3.                LAND DECREE—PEASANTS’ “NAKAZ”The Land question can only be permanently settled by the generalConstituent Assembly.The most equitable solution of the Land question should be as follows:1. The right of private ownership of land is abolished forever; landcannot be sold, nor leased, nor mortgaged, nor alienated in any way.All dominical lands, lands attached to titles, lands belonging to theEmperor’s cabinet, to monasteries, churches, possession lands,entailed lands, private estates, communal lands, peasant free-holds,and others, are confiscated without compensation, and become nationalproperty, and are placed at the disposition of the workers whocultivate them.Those who are damaged because of this social transformation of therights of property are entitled to public aid during the timenecessary for them to adapt themselves to the new conditions ofexistence.2. All the riches beneath the earth—ores, oil, coal, salt, etc.—aswell as forests and waters having a national importance, become theexclusive property of the State. All minor streams, lakes and forestsare placed in the hands of the communities, on condition of beingmanaged by the local organs of government.3. All plots of land scientifically cultivated—gardens, plantations,nurseries, seed-plots, green-houses, and others—shall not be divided,but transformed into model farms, and pass into the hands of theState or of the community, according to their size and importance.Buildings, communal lands and villages with their private gardens andtheir orchards remain in the hands of their present owners; thedimensions of these plots and the rate of taxes for their use shallbe fixed by law.4. All studs, governmental and private cattle-breeding andbird-breeding establishments, and others, are confiscated and becomenational property, and are transferred either to the State or to thecommunity, according to their size and importance.All questions of compensation for the above are within the competenceof the Constituent Assembly.5. All inventoried agricultural property of the confiscated lands,machinery  and live-stock, are transferred without compensation tothe State or the community, according to their quantity andimportance.The confiscation of such machinery or live-stock shall not apply tothe small properties of peasants.6. The right to use the land is granted to all citizens, withoutdistinction of sex, who wish to work the land themselves, with thehelp of their families, or in partnership, and only so long as theyare able to work. No hired labour is permitted.In the event of the incapacity for work of a member of the communefor a period of two years, the commune shall be bound to render himassistance during this time by working his land in common.Farmers who through old age or sickness have permanently lost thecapacity to work the land themselves, shall surrender their land andreceive instead a Government pension.7. The use of the land should be equalised—that is to say, the landshall be divided among the workers according to local conditions, theunit of labour and the needs of the individual.The way in which land is to be used may be individually determinedupon: as homesteads, as farms, by communes, by partnerships, as willbe decided by the villages and settlements.8. All land upon its confiscation is pooled in the general People’sLand Fund. Its distribution among the workers is carried out by thelocal and central organs of administration, beginning with thevillage democratic organisations and ending with the centralprovincial institutions—with the exception of urban and ruralcooperative societies.The Land Fund is subject to periodical redistribution according tothe increase of population and the development of productivity andrural economy.In case of modification of the boundaries of allotments, the originalcentre of the allotment remains intact.The lands of persons retiring from the community return to the LandFund; providing that near relatives of the persons retiring, orfriends designated by them, shall have preference in theredistribution of these lands.When lands are returned to the Land Fund, the money expended formanuring or improving the land, which has not been exhausted, shallbe reimbursed.If in some localities the Land Fund is insufficient to satisfy thelocal population, the surplus population should emigrate.The organisation of the emigration, also the costs thereof, and theproviding of emigrants with the necessary machinery and live-stock,shall be the business of the State.The emigration shall be carried out in the following order: first,the peasants without land who express their wish to emigrate; thenthe undesirable members of the community, deserters, etc., andfinally, by drawing lots on agreement.All which is contained in this _nakaz,_ being the expression of theindisputable will of the great majority of conscious peasants ofRussia, is declared to be a temporary law, and until the convocationof the Constituent Assembly, becomes effective immediately so far asis possible, and in some parts of it gradually, as will be determinedby the District Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies.                                 4.                        THE LAND AND DESERTERSThe Government was not forced to make any decision concerning therights of deserters to the land. The end of the war and thedemobilisation of the army automatically removed the deserterproblem….                                 5.                THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARSThe Council of People’s Commissars was at first composed entirely ofBolsheviki. This was not entirely the fault of the Bolsheviki,however. On November 8th they offered portfolios to members of theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries, who declined. See page 273. {of originalvolume}                       APPENDIX  TO CHAPTER VI                                 1.                        APPEALS AND DENUNCIATIONSAppeal to all Citizens and to the Military Organisations of theSocialist Revolutionary Party.“The senseless attempt of the Bolsheviki is on the eve of completefailure. The garrison is disaffected…. The Ministries are idle, breadis lacking. All factions except a handful of Bolsheviki have left theCongress of Soviets. The Bolsheviki are alone! Abuses of all sorts,acts of vandalism and pillage, the bombardment of the Winter Palace,arbitrary arrests—all these crimes committed by the Bolsheviki havearoused against them the resentment of the majority of the sailorsand soldiers. The _Tsentroflot_ refuses to submit to the orders ofthe Bolsheviki….“We call upon all sane elements to gather around the Committee forSalvation of Country and Revolution; to take serious measures to beready, at the first call of the Central Committee of the Party, toact against the counter-revolutionists, who will doubtless attempt toprofit by these troubles provoked by the Bolshevik adventure, and towatch closely the external enemy, who also would like to takeadvantage of this opportune moment when the Front is weakened….”                _The Military Section of the Central Committee of                        the Socialist Revolutionary Party._                        *     *     *     *     *From _Pravda:_“What is Kerensky?“A usurper, whose place is in Peter-Paul prison, with Kornilov andKishkin.“A criminal and a traitor to the workers, soldiers and peasants, whobelieved in him.“Kerensky? A murderer of soldiers!“Kerensky? A public executioner of peasants!“Kerensky? A strangler of workers!“Such is the second Kornilov who now wants to butcher Liberty!”                      APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VII                                 1.                            TWO DECREES                            _On the Press_In the serious decisive hour of the Revolution and the daysimmediately following it, the Provisional Revolutionary Committee iscompelled to adopt a series of measures against thecounter-revolutionary press of all shades.Immediately on all sides there are cries that the new Socialistauthority is in this violating the essential principles of its ownprogramme by an attempt against the freedom of the press.The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government calls the attention of thepopulation to the fact that in our country, behind this liberalshield, is hidden the opportunity for the wealthier classes to seizethe lion’s share of the whole press, and by this means to poison thepopular mind and bring confusion into the consciousness of the masses.Every one knows that the bourgeois press is one of the most powerfulweapons of the bourgeoisie. Especially in this critical moment, whenthe new authority of the workers and peasants is in process ofconsolidation, it is impossible to leave it in the hands of theenemy, at a time when it is not less dangerous than bombs andmachine-guns. This is why temporary and extraordinary measures havebeen adopted for the purpose of stopping the flow of filth andcalumny in which the yellow and green press would be glad to drownthe young victory of the people.As soon as the new order is consolidated, all administrative measuresagainst the press will be suspended; full liberty will be given itwithin the limits of responsibility before the law, in accordancewith the broadest and most progressive regulations….Bearing in mind, however, the fact that any restrictions of thefreedom of the press, even in critical moments, are admissible onlywithin the bounds of necessity, the Council of People’s Commissarsdecrees as follows:1. The following classes of newspapers shall be subject to closure:(a) Those inciting to open resistance or disobedience to the Workers’and Peasants’ Government; (b) Those creating confusion by obviouslyand deliberately perverting the news; (c) Those inciting to acts of acriminal character punishable by the laws.2. The temporary or permanent closing of any organ of the press shallbe carried out only by virtue of a resolution of the Council ofPeople’s Commissars.3. The present decree is of a temporary nature, and will be revokedby a special _ukaz_ when normal conditions of public life arere-established.                       _President of the Council of People’s Commissars,_                                                VLADIMIR ULIANOV (LENIN).                        *     *     *     *     *                        _On Workers’ Militia_1. All Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies shall form aWorkers’ Militia.2. This Workers’ Militia shall be entirely at the orders of theSoviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.3. Military and civil authorities must render every assistance inarming the workers and in supplying them with technical equipment,even to the extent of requisitioning arms belonging to the WarDepartment of the Government.4. This decree shall be promulgated by telegraph. Petrograd, November10, 1917.                                _People’s Commissar of the Interior_                                                A. I.

THE STRIKE FUNDThe fund for the striking Government employees and bank clerks wassubscribed by banks and business houses of Petrograd and othercities, and also by foreign corporations doing business in Russia.All who consented to strike against the Bolsheviki were paid fullwages, and in some cases their pay was increased. It was therealisation of the strike fund contributors that the Bolsheviki werefirmly in power, followed by their refusal to pay strike benefits,which finally broke the strike.                      APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VIII                                 1.                        KERENSKY’S ADVANCEOn November 9th Kerensky and his Cossacks arrived at Gatchina, wherethe garrison, hopelessly split into two factions, immediatelysurrendered. The members of the Gatchina Soviet were arrested, and atfirst threatened with death; later they were released on goodbehaviour.The Cossack advance-guards, practically unopposed, occupied Pavlovsk,Alexandrovsk and other stations, and reached the outskirts ofTsarskoye Selo next morning—November 10th. At once the garrisondivided into three groups—the officers, loyal to Kerenskly; part ofthe soldiers and non-commissioned officers, who declared themselves“neutral”; and most of the rank and file, who were for theBolsheviki. The Bolshevik soldiers, who were without leaders ororganisation, fell back toward the capital. The local Soviet alsowithdrew to the village of Pulkovo.From Pulkovo six members of the Tsarskoye Selo Soviet went with anautomobile-load of proclamations to Gatchina, to propagandise theCossacks. They spent most of the day going around Gatchina from oneCossack barracks to another, pleading, arguing and explaining. Towardevening some officers discovered their presence and they werearrested and brought before General Krasnov, who said, “You foughtagainst Kornilov; now you are opposing Kerensky. I’ll have you allshot!”After reading aloud to them the order appointing himcommander-in-chief of the Petrograd District, Krasnov asked if theywere Bolsheviki. They replied in the affirmative—upon which Krasnovwent away; a short time later an officer came and set them free,saying that it was by order of General Krasnov….In the meanwhile delegations continued to arrive from Petrograd; fromthe Duma, the Committee for Salvation, and, last of all, from the_Vikzhel._ The Union of Railway Workers insisted that some agreementbe reached to halt the civil war, and demanded that Kerensky treatwith the Bolsheviki, and that he stop the advance on Petrograd. Incase of refusal, the _Vikzhel_ threatened a general strike atmidnight of November 11th.Kerensky asked to be allowed to discuss the matter with the SocialistMinisters and with the Committee for Salvation. He was plainlyundecided.On the 11th Cossack outposts reached Krasnoye Selo, from which thelocal Soviet and the heterogeneous forces of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee precipitately retired, some of themsurrendering…. That night they also touched Pulkovo, where the firstreal resistance was encountered….Cossacks deserters began to dribble into Petrograd, declaring thatKerensky had lied to them, that he had spread broadcast over thefront proclamations which said that Petrograd was burning, that theBolsheviki  had invited the Germans to come in, and that they weremurdering women and children and looting indiscriminately….The Military Revolutionary Committee immediately sent out some dozensof “agitators,” with thousands of printed appeals, to inform theCossacks of the real situation….                                 2.        PROCLAMATIONS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE“To All Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies.“The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ andPeasants’ Deputies charges the local Soviets immediately to take themost energetic measures to oppose all counter-revolutionaryanti-Semitic disturbances, and all _pogroms_ of whatever nature. Thehonour of the workers’, peasants’ and soldiers’ Revolution cannottolerate any disorders….“The Red Guard of Petrograd, the revolutionary garrison and thesailors have maintained complete order in the capital.“Workers, soldiers, and peasants, everywhere you should follow theexample of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd.“Comrades soldiers and Cossacks, on us falls the duty of keeping realrevolutionary order.“All revolutionary Russia and the whole world have their eyes onyou….”“The All-Russian Congress of Soviets decrees:“To abolish capital punishment at the Front, which was reintroducedby Kerensky.“Complete freedom of propaganda is to be re-established in thecountry. All soldiers and revolutionary officers now under arrest forso-called political ‘crimes’ are at once to be set free.”“The ex-Premier Kerensky, overthrown by the people, refuses to submitto the Congress of Soviets and attempts to struggle against the legalGovernment elected by the All-Russian Congress—the Council ofPeople’s Commissars. The Front has refused to aid Kerensky. Moscowhas rallied to the new Government. In many cities (Minsk, Moghilev,Kharkov) the power is in the hands of the Soviets. No infantrydetachment consents to march against the Workers’ and Peasants’Government, which, in accord with the firm will of the Army and thepeople, has begun peace negotiations and has given the land to thepeasants….“We give public warning that if the Cossacks do not halt Kerensky,who has deceived them and is leading them against Petrograd, therevolutionary forces will rise with all their might for the defenceof the precious conquests of the Revolution—Peace and Land.“Citizens of Petrograd! Kerensky fled from the city, abandoning theauthority to Kishkin, who wanted to surrender the capital to theGermans; Rutenburg, of the Black Band, who sabotaged the MunicipalFood Supply; and Paltchinsky, hated by the whole democracy. Kerenskyhas fled, abandoning you to the Germans, to famine, to bloodymassacres. The revolting people have arrested Kerensky’s Ministers,and you have seen how the order and supplying of Petrograd at onceimproved. Kerensky, at the demand of the aristocrat proprietors, thecapitalists, speculators, marches against you for the purpose ofgiving back the land to the land-owners, and continuing the hated andruinous war.“Citizens of Petrograd! We know that the great majority of you are infavour of the people’s revolutionary authority, against theKornilovtsi led by Kerensky. Do not be deceived by the lyingdeclarations of the impotent bourgeois conspirators, who will bepitilessly crushed.“Workers, soldiers, peasants! We call upon you for revolutionarydevotion and discipline.“Millions of peasants and soldiers are with us.“The victory of the people’s Revolution is assured!”                                 3.                ACTS OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARSIn this book I am giving only such decrees as are in my opinionpertinent to the Bolshevik conquest of power. The rest belong to adetailed account of the Structure of the Soviet State, for which Ihave no place in this work. This will be dealt with very fully in thesecond volume, now in preparation, “Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk.”                _Concerning Dwelling-Places_1. The independent Municipal Self-Governments have the right tosequestrate all unoccupied or uninhabited dwelling-places.2. The Municipalities may, according to laws and arrangementsestablished by them, install in all available lodgings citizens whohave no place to live, or who live in congested or unhealthy lodgings.3. The Municipalities may establish a service of inspection ofdwelling-places, organise it and define its powers.4. The Municipalities may issue orders on the institution of HouseCommittees, define their organisation, their powers and give themjuridical authority.5. The Municipalities may create Housing Tribunals, define theirpowers and their authority.6. This decree is promulgated by telegraph.                                _People’s Commissar of the Interior,_                                                A. I.

The Government of the Tsar, the proprietors and thecapitalists, as well as the Government of coalition and conciliation,failed to realise the desires of the workers with regard to SocialInsurance.The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government, relying upon the support ofthe Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, announcesto the working-class of Russia and to the town and village poor, thatit will immediately prepare laws on Social Insurance based on theformulas proposed by the Labour organisations:1. Insurance for all wage-workers without exception, as well as forall urban and rural poor.2. Insurance to cover all categories of loss of working capacity,such as illness, infirmities, old age, childbirth, widowhood,orphanage, and unemployment.3. All the costs of insurance to be charged to employers.4. Compensation of at least full wages in all loss of workingcapacity and unemployment.5. Complete workers’ self-government of all Insurance institutions.In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic,                                _The People’s Commissar of Labour,_                                                ALEXANDER SHLIAPNIKOV.                        *     *     *     *     *                        _On Popular Education_Citizens of Russia!With the insurrection of November 7th the working masses have won forthe first time the real power.The All-Russian Congress of Soviets has temporarily transferred thispower both to its Executive Committee and to the Council of People’sCommissars.By the will of the revolutionary people, I have been appointedPeople’s Commissar of Education.The work of guiding in general the people’s education, inasmuch as itremains with the central government, is, until the ConstituentAssembly meets, entrusted to a Commission on the People’s Education,whose chairman and executive is the People’s Commissar.Upon what fundamental propositions will rest this State Commission?How is its sphere of competence determined?_The General Line of Educational Activity:_ Every genuinelydemocratic power must, in the domain of education, in a country whereilliteracy and ignorance reign supreme, make its first aim thestruggle against this darkness. It must acquire in the shortest time_universal literacy,_ by organising a network of schools answering tothe demands of modern pedagogics; it must introduce universal,obligatory and free tuition for all, and establish at the same time aseries of such teachers’ institutes and seminaries as will in theshortest time furnish a powerful army of people’s teachers sonecessary for the universal instruction of the population of ourboundless Russia._Decentralisation:_ The State Commission on People’s Education is byno means a central power governing the institutions of instructionand education. On the contrary, the entire school work ought to betransferred to the organs of local self-government. The independentwork of the workers, soldiers and peasants, establishing on their owninitiative cultural educational organisations, must be given fullautonomy, both by the State centre and the Municipal centres.The work of the State Commission serves as a link and helpmate toorganise resources of material and moral support to the Municipal andprivate institutions, particularly to those with a class-characterestablished by the workers._The State Committee on People’s Education:_ A whole series ofinvaluable law projects was elaborated from the beginning of theRevolution by the State Committee for People’s Education, a tolerablydemocratic body as to its composition, and rich in experts. The StateCommission sincerely desires the collaboration of this Committee.It has addressed itself to the bureau of the Committee, with therequest at once to convoke an extraordinary session of the Committeefor the fulfilment of the following programme:1. The revision of rules of representation in the Committee, in thesense of greater democratisation.2. The revision of the Committee’s rights in the sense of wideningthem, and of converting the Committee into a fundamental Stateinstitute for the elaboration of law projects calculated toreorganise public instruction and education in Russia upon democraticprinciples.3. The revision, jointly with the new State Commission, of the lawsalready created by the Committee, a revision required by the factthat in editing them the Committee had to take into account thebourgeois spirit of previous Ministries, which obstructed it even inthis its narrowed form.After this revision these laws will be put into effect without anybureau-cratic red tape, in the revolutionary order._The Pedagogues and the Societists:_ The State Commission welcomesthe pedagogues to the bright and honourable work of educating thepeople—the masters of the country.No one measure in the domain of the people’s education ought to beadopted by any power without the attentive deliberation of those whorepresent the pedagogues.On the other hand, a decision cannot by any means be reachedexclusively through the cooperation of specialists. This refers aswell to reforms of the institutes of general education.The cooperation of the pedagogues with the social forces—this is howthe Commission will work both in its own constitution, in the StateCommittee, and in all its activities.As its first task the Commission considers the improvement of theteachers’ status, and first of all of those very poor though almostmost important contributors to the work of culture—the elementaryschool teachers. Their just demands ought to be satisfied at once andat any cost. The proletariat of the schools has in vain demanded anincrease of salary to one hundred rubles per month. It would be adisgrace any longer to keep in poverty the teachers of theoverwhelming majority of the Russian people.But a real democracy cannot stop at mere literacy, at universalelementary instruction. It must endeavour to organise a uniformsecular school of several grades. The ideal is, equal and if possiblehigher education for all the citizens. So long as this idea has notbeen realised for all, the natural transition through all theschooling grades up to the university—a transition to a higherstage—must depend entirely upon the pupil’s aptitude, and not uponthe resources of his family.The problem of a genuinely democratic organisation of instruction isparticularly difficult in a country impoverished by a long, criminal,imperialistic war; but the workers who have taken the power mustremember that education will serve them as the greatest instrument intheir struggle for a better lot and for a spiritual growth. Howeverneedful it may be to curtail other articles of the people’s budget,the expenses on education must stand high. A large educational budgetis the pride and glory of a nation. The free and enfranchised peoplesof Russia will not forget this.The fight against illiteracy and ignorance cannot be confined to athorough establishment of school education for children and youths.Adults, too, will be anxious to save themselves from the debasingposition of a man who cannot read and write. The school for adultsmust occupy a conspicuous place in the general plan of popularinstruction._Instruction and Education:_ One must emphasise the differencebetween instruction and education.Instruction is the transmission of ready knowledge by the teacher tohis pupil. Education is a creative process. The personality of theindividual is being “educated” throughout life, is being formed,grows richer in content, stronger and more perfect.The toiling masses of the people—the workmen, the peasants, thesoldiers—are thirsting for elementary and advanced instruction. Butthey are also thirsting for education. Neither the government nor theintellectuals nor any other power outside of themselves can give itto them. The school, the book, the theatre, the museum, etc., mayhere by only aids. They have their own ideas, formed by their socialposition, so different from the position of those ruling classes andintellectuals who have hitherto created culture. They have their ownideas, their own emotions, their own ways of approaching the problemsof personality and society. The city labourer, according to his ownfashion, the rural toiler according to his, will each build his clearworld-conception permeated with the class-idea  of the workers. Thereis no more superb or beautiful phenomenon than the one of which ournearest descendants will be both witnesses and participants: Thebuilding by collective Labour of its own general, rich and free soul.Instruction will surely be an important but not a decisive element.What is more important here is the criticism, the creativeness of themasses themselves; for science and art have only in some of theirparts a general human importance. They suffer radical changes withevery far-reaching class upheaval.Throughout Russia, particularly among the city labourers, but alsoamong the peasants, a powerful wave of cultural educational movementhas arisen; workers’ and soldiers’ organisations of this kind aremultiplying rapidly. To meet them, to lend them support, to clear theroad before them is the first task of a revolutionary and populargovernment in the domain of democratic education._The Constituent Assembly_ will doubtless soon begin its work. Italone can permanently establish the order of national and social lifein our country, and at the same time the general character of theorganisation of popular education.Now, however, with the passage of power to the Soviets, the reallydemocratic character of the Constituent Assembly is assured. The linewhich the State Commission, relying upon the State Committee, willfollow, will hardly suffer any modification under the influence ofthe Constituent Assembly. Without pre-determining it, the newPeople’s Government considers itself within its rights in enacting inthis domain a series of measures which aim at enriching andenlightening as soon as possible the spiritual life of the country._The Ministry:_ The present work must in the interim proceed throughthe Ministry of the People’s Education. Of all the necessaryalterations in its composition and construction the State Commissionwill have charge, elected by the Executive Committee of the Sovietsand the State Committee. Of course the order of State authority inthe domain of the people’s education will be established by theConstituent Assembly. Until then, the Ministry must play the part ofthe executive apparatus for both the State Committee and the StateCommission for People’s Education.The pledge of the country’s safety lies in the cooperation of all itsvital and genuinely democratic forces.We believe that the energetic effort of the working people and of thehonest enlightened intellectuals will lead the country out of itspainful crisis, and through complete democracy to the reign ofSocialism and the brotherhood of nations.                                _People’s Commissar on Education,_                                        A.

MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE. BULLETIN NO. 2November 12th, in the evening, Kerensky sent a proposition to therevolutionary troops—“to lay down their arms.” Kerensky’s men openedartillery fire. Our artillery answered and compelled the enemy to besilent. The Cossacks assumed the offensive. The deadly fire of thesailors, the Red Guards and the soldiers forced the Cossacks toretreat. Our armoured cars rushed in among the ranks of the enemy.The enemy is fleeing. Our troops are in pursuit. The order has beengiven to arrest Kerensky. Tsarskoye Selo has been taken by therevolutionary troops._The Lettish Riflemen:_ The Military Revolutionary Committee hasreceived precise information that the valiant Lettish Riflemen havearrived from the Front and taken up a position in the rear ofKerensky’s bands._From the Staff of the Military Revolutionary Committee_The seizure of Gatchina and Tsarskoye Selo by Kerensky’s detachmentsis to be explained by the complete absence of artillery andmachine-guns in these places, whereas Kerensky’s cavalry was providedwith artillery from the beginning. The last two days were days ofenforced work for our Staff, to provide the necessary quantity ofguns, machine-guns, field telephones, etc., for the revolutionarytroops. When this work—with the energetic assistance of the DistrictSoviets and the factories (the Putilov Works, Obukhov and others)—wasaccomplished, the issue of the expected encounter left no place fordoubt: on the side of the revolutionary troops there was not only asurplus in quantity and such a powerful material base as Petrograd,but also an enormous moral advantage. All the Petrograd regimentsmoved out to the positions with tremendous enthusiasm. The GarrisonConference elected a Control Commission of five soldiers, thussecuring a complete unity between the commander in chief and thegarrison. At the Garrison Conference it was unanimously decided tobegin decisive action.The artillery fire on the 12th of November developed withextraordinary force by 3 P.M. The Cossacks were completelydemoralised. A parliamentarian came from them to the staff of thedetachment at Krasnoye Selo, and proposed to stop the firing,threatening otherwise to take “decisive” measures. He was answeredthat the firing would cease when Kerensky laid down his arms.In the developing encounter all sections of the troops—the sailors,soldiers and the Red Guards—showed unlimited courage. The sailorscontinued to advance until they had fired all their cartridges. Thenumber of casualties has not been established yet, but it is largeron the part of the counter-revolutionary troops, who experiencedgreat losses through one of our armoured cars.Kerensky’s staff, fearing that they would be surrounded, gave theorder to retreat, which retreat speedily assumed a disorderlycharacter. By 11-12 P.M., Tsarkoye Selo, including the wirelessstation, was entirely occupied by the troops of the Soviets. TheCossacks retreated towards Gatchina and Colpinno.The morale of the troops is beyond all praise. The order has beengiven to pursue the retreating Cossacks. From the Tsarskoye Selostation a radio-telegram was sent immediately to the Front and to alllocal Soviets throughout Russia. Further details will becommunicated….                                 2.                    EVENTS OF THE 13TH IN PETROGRADThree regiments of the Petrograd garrison to take any part in thebattle against Kerensky. On the morning of the 13th they summoned toa joint conference sixty delegates from the Front, in order to findsome way to stop the civil war. This conference appointed a committeeto go and persuade Kerensky’s troops to lay down their arms. Theyproposed to ask the Government soldiers the following questions: (1)Will the soldiers and Cossacks of Kerensky recognise the_Tsay-ee-kah_ as the repository of Governmental power, responsible tothe Congress of Soviets? (2) Will the soldiers and Cossacks acceptthe decrees of the second Congress of Soviets? (3) Will they acceptthe Land and Peace decrees? (4) Will they agree to cease hostilitiesand return to their units? (5) Will they consent to the arrest ofKerensky, Krasnov and Savinkov?At the meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, Zinoviev said, “It would befoolish to think that this committee could finish affair. The enemycan only be broken by force. However, it would be a crime for us notto try every peaceful means to bring the Cossacks over to us…. Whatwe need is a military victory…. The news of an armistice ispremature. Our Staff will be ready to conclude an armistice when theenemy can no longer do any harm….“At present, the influence of our victory is creating new politicalconditions…. To-day the Socialist Revolutionaries are inclined areinclined to admit the Bolsheviki into the new Government…. A decisivevictory is indispensable, so that those who hesitate will have nofurther hesitation….”At the City Duma all attention was concentrated on the formation ofthe new Government. In many factories and barracks alreadyRevolutionary Tribunals were operating, and the Bolsheviki werethreatening to set up more of these, and try Gotz and Avksentievbefore them. Dan proposed that an ultimatum be sent demanding theabolition of these Revolutionary Tribunals, or the other members ofthe Conference would immediately break off all negotiations with theBolsheviki.Shingariov, Cadet, declared that the Municipality ought not to takepart in any agreement with the Bolsheviki…. “Any agreement with themaniacs is impossible until they lay down their arms and recognisethe authority of independent courts of law….”Yartsev, for the _Yedinstvo_ group, declared that any agreement withthe Bolsheviki would be equivalent to a Bolshevik victory….Mayor Schreider, for the Socialist Revolutionaries, stated that hewas opposed to all agreement with the Bolsheviki…. “As for aGovernment, that ought to spring from the popular will; and since thepopular will has been expressed in the municipal elections, thepopular will which can create a Government is actually concentratedin the Duma….”After other speakers, of which only the representative of theMensheviki Internationalists was in favour of considering theadmission of the Bolsheviki into the new Government, the Duma votedto continue its representatives in the _Vikzhel’s_ conference, but toinsist upon the restoration of the Provisional Government beforeeverything, and to exclude the Bolsheviki from the new power….                                 3.        TRUCE. KRASNOV’s ANSWER TO THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION“In answer to your telegram proposing an immediate armistice, theSupreme Commander, not wishing further futile bloodshed, consents toenter into negotiations and to establish relations between the armiesof the Government and the insurrectionists. He proposes to theGeneral Staff of the insurrectionists to recall its regiments toPetrograd, to declare the line Ligovo-Pulkovo-Colpinno neutral, andto allow the advance-guards of the Government cavalry to enterTsarskoye Selo, for the purpose of establishing order. The answer tothis proposal must be placed in the hands of our envoys before eighto’clock to-morrow morning.                                                KRASNOV.”                                 4.                        EVENTS AT TSARSKOYE SELOOn the evening that Kerensky’s troops retreated from Tsarskoye Selo,some priests organised a religious procession through the streets ofthe town, making speeches to the citizens in which they asked thepeople to support the rightful authority, the Provisional Government.When the Cossacks had retreated, and the first Red Guards entered thetown, witnesses reported that the priests had incited the peopleagainst the Soviets, and had said prayers at the grave of Rasputin,which lies behind the Imperial Palace. One of the priests, FatherIvan Kutchurov, was arrested and shot by the infuriated Red Guards….Just as the Red Guards entered the town the electric lights were shutoff, plunging the streets in complete darkness. The director of theelectric light plant, Lubovitch, was arrested by the Soviet troopsand asked why he had shut off the lights. He was found some timelater in the room where he had been imprisoned with a revolver in hishand and a bullet hole in his temple.The Petrograd anti-Bolshevik papers came out next day with headlines,“Plekhanov’s temperature 39 degrees!” Plekhanov lived at TsarskoyeSelo, where he was lying ill in bed. Red Guards arrived at the houseand searched it for arms, questioning the old man.“What class of society do you belong to?” they asked him.“I am a revolutionist,” answered Plekhanov, “who for forty years hasdevoted his life to the struggle for liberty!”“Anyway,” said a workman, “you have now sold yourself to thebourgeoisie!”The workers no longer knew Plekhanov, pioneer of the Russian SocialDemocracy!                                 5.                    APPEAL OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT“The detachments at Gatchina, deceived by Kerensky, have laid downtheir arms and decided to arrest Kerensky. That chief of thecounter-revolutionary campaign has fled. The Army, by an enormousmajority, has pronounced in favour of the second All-Russian Congressof Soviets, and of the Government which it has created. Scores ofdelegates from the Front have hastened to Petrograd to assure theSoviet Government of the Army’s fidelity. No twisting of the facts,no calumny against the revolutionary workers, soldiers, and peasants,has been able to defeat the People. The Workers’ and Soldiers’Revolution is victorious….“The _Tsay-ee-kah_ appeals to the troops which march under the flagof the counter-revolution, and invites them immediately to lay downtheir arms—to shed no longer the blood of their brothers in theinterests of a handful of land-owners and capitalists. The Workers’,Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Revolution curses those who remain even for amoment under the flag of the People’s enemies….“Cossacks! Come over to the rank of the victorious People!Railwaymen, postmen, telegraphers—all, all support the new Governmentof the People!”                        APPENDIX TO CHAPTER X                                 1.                        DAMAGE TO THE KREMLINI myself verified the damage to the Kremlin, which I visitedimmediately after the bombardment. The Little Nicolai Palace, abuilding of no particular importance, which was occupied occasionallyby receptions of one of the Grand Duchesses, had served as barracksfor the _yunkers._ It was not only bombarded, but pretty well sacked;fortunately there was nothing in it of particular historical value.Usspensky Cathedral had a shell-hole in one of the cupolas, butexcept for a few feet of mosaic in the ceiling, was undamaged. Thefrescoes on the porch of Blagovestchensky Cathedral were badlydamaged by a shell. Another shell hit the corner of Ivan Veliki.Tchudovsky Monastery was hit about thirty times, but only one shellwent through a window into the interior, the others breaking thebrick window-moulding and the roof cornices.The clock over the Spasskaya Gate was smashed. Troitsky Gate wasbattered, but easily reparable. One of the lower towers had lost itsbrick spire.The church of St. Basil was untouched, as was the great ImperialPalace, with all the treasures of Moscow and Petrograd in its cellar,and the crown jewels in the Treasury. These places were not evenentered.                                 2.                        LUNATCHARSKY’s DECLARATION“Comrades! You are the young masters of the country, and although nowyou have much to do and think about, you must know how to defend yourartistic and scientific treasures.“Comrades! That which is happening at Moscow is a horrible,irreparable misfortune…. The People in its struggle for the power hasmutilated our glorious capital.“It is particularly terrible in these days of violent struggle, ofdestructive warfare, to be Commissar of Public Education. Only thehope of the victory of Socialism, the source of a new and superiorculture, brings me comfort. On me weighs the responsibility ofprotecting the artistic wealth of the people…. Not being able toremain at my post, where I had no influence, I resigned. My comrades,the other Commissars, considered this resignation inadmissible. Ishall therefore remain at my post…. And moreover, I understand thatthe damage done to the Kremlin is not as serious as has beenreported….“But I beg you, comrades, to give me your support…. Preserve foryourselves and your descendants the beauty of our land; be theguardians of the property of the People.“Soon, very soon, even the most ignorant, who have been held inignorance so long, will awake and understand what a source of joy,strength and wisdom is art….”                                 3.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS CHAPTERThis chapter extends over a period of two months, more or less. Itcovers the time of negotiations with the Allies, the negotiations andarmistice with the Germans, and the beginning of the Peacenegotiations at Brest-Litovsk, as well as the period in which werelaid the foundations of the Soviet State.However, it is no part of my purpose in this book to describe andinterpret these very important historical events, which require morespace. They are therefore reserved for another volume, "Kornilov toBrest-Litovsk."In this chapter, then, I have confined myself to the SovietGovernment's attempts to consolidate its political power at home, andsketched its successive conquests of hostile domestic elements—whichprocess was temporarily interrupted by the disastrous Peace ofBrest-Litovsk.                                 2.        PREAMBLE—DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIAThe October Revolution of the workers and peasants began under thecommon banner of Emancipation.The peasants are being emancipated from the power of the landowners,for there is no longer the landowner's property right in the land—ithas been abolished. The soldiers and sailors are being emancipatedfrom the power of autocratic generals, for generals will henceforthbe elective and subject to recall. The workingmen are beingemancipated from the whims and arbitrary will of the capitalists, forhenceforth there will be established the control of the workers overmills and factories. Everything living and capable of life is beingemancipated from the hateful shackles.There remain only the peoples of Russia, who have suffered and aresuffering oppression and arbitrariness, and whose emancipation mustimmediately be begun, whose liberation must be effected resolutelyand definitely.During the period of Tsarism the peoples of Russia weresystematically incited against one another. The result of such apolicy are known: massacres and _pogroms_ on the one hand, slavery ofpeoples on the other.There can be and there must be no return to this disgraceful policy.Henceforth the policy of a voluntary and honest union of the peoplesof Russia must be substituted.In the period of imperialism, after the March revolution, when thepower was transferred into the hands of the Cadet bourgeoisie, thenaked policy of provocation gave way to one of cowardly distrust ofthe peoples of Russia, to a policy of fault-finding, of meaningless"freedom" and "equality" of peoples. The results of such a policy areknown: the growth of national enmity, the impairment of mutualconfidence.An end must be put to this unworthy policy of falsehood and distrust,of fault-finding and provocation. Henceforth it must be replaced byan open and honest policy leading to the complete mutual confidenceof the peoples of Russia. Only as the result of such a trust canthere be formed an honest and lasting union of the peoples of Russia.Only as the result of such a union can the workers and peasants ofthe peoples of Russia be cemented into one revolutionary force ableto resist all attempts on the part of the imperialist-annexationistbourgeoisie.                                 3.                              DECREES                _On the Nationalisation of the Banks_In the interest of the regular organisation of the national economy,of the thorough eradication of bank speculation and the completeemancipation of the workers, peasants, and the whole labouringpopulation from the exploitation of banking capital, and with a viewto the establishment of a single national bank of the RussianRepublic which shall serve the real interests of the people and thepoorer classes, the Central Executive Committee _(Tsay-ee-kah)_resolves:1. The banking business is declared a state monopoly.2. All existing private joint-stock banks and banking offices aremerged in the State Bank.3. The assets and liabilities of the liquidated establishments aretaken over by the State Bank.4. The order of the merger of private banks in the State Bank is tobe determined by a special decree.5. The temporary administration of the affairs of the private banksis entrusted to the board of the State Bank.6. The interests of the small depositors will be safeguarded.                        *   *   *   *   *                _On the Equality of Rank of All Military Men_In realisation of the will of the revolutionary people regarding theprompt and decisive abolition of all remnants of former inequality inthe Army, the Council of People's Commissars decrees:1. All ranks and grades in the Army, beginning with the rank ofCorporal and ending with the rank of General, are abolished. The Armyof the Russian Republic consists now of free and equal citizens,bearing the honourable title of Soldiers of the Revolutionary Army.2. All privileges connected with the former ranks and grades, alsoall outward marks of distinction, are abolished.3. All addressing by titles is abolished.4. All decorations, orders, and other marks of distinction areabolished.5. With the abolition of the rank of officer, all separate officers'organisations are abolished.Note.—Orderlies are left only for headquarters, chanceries,Committees and other Army organisations.                _President of the Council of People's Commissars,_                                        VL.

The army serving the will of the toiling people is subject to itssupreme representative—the Council of People's Commissars.2. Full authority within the limits of military units andcombinations is vested in the respective Soldiers' Committees andSoviets.3. Those phases of the life and activity of the troops which arealready under the jurisdiction of the Committees are now formallyplaced in their direct control. Over such branches of activity whichthe Committees cannot assume, the control of the Soldiers' Soviets isestablished.4. The election of commanding Staff and officers is introduced. Allcommanders up to the commanders of regiments, inclusive, are electedby general suffrage of squads, platoons, companies, squadrons,batteries, divisions (artillery, 2-3 batteries), and regiments. Allcommanders higher than the commander of a regiment, and up to theSupreme Commander, inclusive, are elected by congresses orconferences of Committees.Note.—By the term "conference" must be understood a meeting of therespective Committees together with delegates of committees onedegree lower in rank. (Such as a "conference" of RegimentalCommittees with delegates from Company Committees.—Author.)5.

RIDICULE OF THE NEW RÉGIME        From _Drug Naroda_ (Menshevik), November 18th:"The story of the 'immediate peace' of the Bolsheviki reminds us of ajoyous moving-picture film…. Neratov runs—Trotzky pursues; Neratovclimbs a wall, Trotzky too; Neratov dives into the water—Trotzkyfollows; Neratov climbs onto the roof—Trotzky right behind him;Neratov hides under the bed—and Trotzky has him! He has him!Naturally, peace is immediately signed…."All is empty and silent at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thecouriers are respectful, but their faces wear a caustic expression…."How about arresting an ambassador and signing an armistice or aPeace Treaty with him? But they are strange folk, these ambassadors.They keep silent just as if they had heard nothing. Hola, hola,England, France, Germany! We have signed an armistice with you! Is itpossible that you know nothing about it? Nevertheless, it has beenpublished in all the papers and posted on all the walls. On aBolshevik's word of honour, Peace has been signed. We're not askingmuch of you; you just have to write two words…."The ambassadors remain silent. The Powers remain silent. All isempty and silent in the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs."'Listen,' says Robespierre-Trotzky to his assistant Marat-Uritzky,'run over to the British Ambassador's, tell him we're proposingpeace!'"'Go yourself,' says Marat-Uritzky. 'He's not receiving.'"'Telephone him, then.'"'I've tried. The receiver's off the hook.'"'Send him a telegram.'"'I did.'"'Well, with what result?'"Marat-Uritzky sighs and does not answer. Robespierre-Trotzky spitsfuriously into the corner…."'Listen, Marat,' recommences Trotzky, after a moment. 'We mustabsolutely show that we're conducting an active foreign policy. Howcan we do that?'"'Launch another decree about arresting Neratov,' answers Uritzky,with a profound air."'Marat, you're a blockhead!' cries Trotzky. All of a sudden hearises, terrible and majestic, looking at this moment likeRobespierre."'Write, Uritzky!' he says with severity. 'Write a letter to theBritish ambassador, a registered letter with receipt demanded. Write!I also will write! The peoples of the world await an immediate peace!'"In the enormous and empty Ministry of Foreign Affairs are to beheard only the sound of two typewriters. With his own hands Trotzkyis conducting an active foreign policy…."                                 6.                ON THE QUESTION OF AN AGREEMENTTo the Attention of All Workers and All Soldiers.November 11th, in the club of the Preobrazhensky Regiment, was heldan extraordinary meeting of representatives of all the units of thePetrograd garrison.The meeting was called upon the initiative of the Preobrazhensky andSemionovsky Regiments, for the discussion of the question as to whichSocialist parties are for the power of the Soviets, which areagainst, which are for the people, which against, and if an agreementbetween them is possible.The representatives of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ of the Municipal Duma, ofthe Avksentiev Peasants' Soviets, and of all the political partiesfrom the Bolsheviki to the Populist Socialists, were invited to themeeting.After long deliberation, having heard the declarations of all partiesand organisations, the meeting by a tremendous majority of votesagreed that only the Bolsheviki and the Left SocialistRevolutionaries are for the people, and that all the other partiesare only attempting, under cover of seeking an agreement, to deprivethe people of the conquests won in the days of the great Workers' andPeasants' Revolution of November.Here is the text of the resolution carried at this meeting of thePetrograd garrison, by 61 votes against 11, and 12 not voting:"The garrison conference, summoned at the initiative of theSemionovsky and Preobrazhensky Regiments, on hearing therepresentatives of all the Socialist parties and popularorganisations on the question of an agreement between the differentpolitical parties finds that:"1. The representatives of the _Tasy-ee-kah,_ the representatives ofthe Bolshevik party and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, declareddefinitely that they stand for a Government of the Soviets, for thedecrees on Land, Peace and Workers' Control of Industry, and thatupon this platform they are willing to agree with all the Socialistparties."2. At the same time the representatives of the other parties(Mensheviki, Socialist Revolutionaries) either gave no answer at all,or declared simply that they were opposed to the power of the Sovietsand against the decrees on Land, Peace and Workers' Control."In view of this the meeting resolves:"'1. To express severe censure of all parties which, under cover ofan agreement, wish practically to annul the popular conquests of theRevolution of November."2. To express full confidence in the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and the Councilof People's Commissars, and to promise them complete support.'"At the same time the meeting deems it necessary that the comradesLeft Socialist Revolutionaries should enter the People's Government."                                 7.                           WINE "POGROMS"It was afterward discovered that there was a regular organisation,maintained by the Cadets, for provoking rioting among the soldiers.There would be telephone messages to the different barracks,announcing that wine was being given away at such and such anaddress, and when the soldiers arrived at the spot an individualwould point out the location of the cellar….The Council of People's Commissars appointed a Commissar for theFight Against Drunkenness, who, besides mercilessly putting down thewine riots, destroyed hundreds of thousands of bottles of liquor. TheWinter Palace cellars, containing rare vintages valued at more thanfive million dollars, were at first flooded, and then the liquor wasremoved to Cronstadt and destroyed.In this work the Cronstadt sailors, "flower and pride of therevolutionary forces," as Trotzky called them, acquitted themselveswith iron selfdicipline….                                 8.

The city is cut off fromthe outside world and is entirely in the power of the Bolsheviki….People are arrested in the streets, thrown into the Neva, drowned andimprisoned without any charge. Even Burtzev is shut up in Peter-Paulfortress, under strict guard."The organisation at whose head I am is working without rest to uniteall the officers and what is left of the _yunker_ schools, and to armthem. The situation cannot be saved except by creating regiments ofofficers and _yunkers._ Attacking with these regiments, and havinggained a first success, we could later gain the aid of the garrisontroops; but without that first success it is impossible to count on asingle soldier, because thousands of them are divided and terrorisedby the scum which exists in every regiment. Most of the Cossacks aretainted by Bolshevik propaganda, thanks to the strange policy ofGeneral Dutov, who allowed to pass the moment when by decisive actionsomething could have been obtained. The policy of negotiations andconcessions has borne its fruits; all that is respectable ispersecuted, and it is the _plebe_ and the criminals who dominate—andnothing can be done except by shooting and hanging them."We are awaiting you here, General, and at the moment of yourarrival, we shall advance with all the forces at our disposal. Butfor that we must establish some communication with you, and beforeall, clear up the following points:"(1) Do you know that in your name all officers who could take partin the fight are being invited to leave Petrograd on the pretext ofjoining you?"(2) About when can we count on your arrival at Petrograd? We shouldlike to know in order to coordinate our actions."In spite of the criminal inaction of the conscious people here,which allowed the yoke of Bolshevism to be laid upon us—in spite ofthe extraordinary pig—headedness of the majority of officers, sodifficult to organise— we believe in spite of all that Truth is onour side, and that we shall conquer the vicious and criminal forceswho say that they are acting for motives of love of country and inorder to save it. Whatever comes, we shall not permit ourselves to bestruck down, and shall remain firm until the end."Purishkevitch, being brought to trial before the RevolutionaryTribunal, was given a short prison term….                                10.

Every conscious worker understandsperfectly that we cannot avoid this hostility, because the highofficials have set themselves against the People and do not wish toabandon their posts without resistance.

We have justice on our side. Ourultimate victory is certain."The resistance of the capitalists and high officials will be broken.No one will be deprived of his property without a special law on thenationalisation of banks and financial syndicates. This law is inpreparation. Not a worker will lose a single kopek; on the contrary,he will be assisted.

Remember that you yourselves direct theGovernment. No one will help you unless you organise yourselves andtake into your own hands the affairs of the State. Your Soviets arenow the organs of governmental power…. Strengthen them, establish asevere revolutionary control, pitilessly crush the attempts atanarchy on the part of drunkards, brigands, counter-revolutionary_yunkers_ and Kornilovists."Establish a strict control over production and the accounting forproducts. Arrest and turn over to the Revolutionary Tribunal of thePeople every one who injures the property of the People, by sabotagein production, by concealment of grain-reserves, reserves of otherproducts, by retarding the shipments of grain, by bringing confusioninto the railroads, the posts and the telegraphs, or in generalopposing the great work of bringing Peace and transferring the Landto the peasants…."Comrades workers, soldiers, peasants—all toilers!"Take immediately all local power into your hands…. Little by little,with the consent of the majority of peasants, we shall march firmlyand unhesitatingly toward the victory of Socialism, which willfortify the advance-guards of the working-class of the most civilisedCountries, and give to the peoples an enduring peace, and free themfrom every slavery and every exploitation."                                13._"To All Workers of Petrograd!_"Comrades! The Revolution is winning—the revolution has won. All thepower has passed over to our Soviets. The first weeks are the mostdifficult ones.

FROM THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARS TO THE TOILING COSSACKS_“Brothers-Cossacks._“You are being deceived. You are being incited against the People.You are told that the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’Deputies are your enemies, that they want to take away your Cossackland, your Cossack ‘liberty’. Don’t believe it, Cossacks…. Your ownGenerals and landowners are deceiving you, in order to keep you indarkness and slavery.  We, the Council of People’s Commissars,address ourselves to you, Cossacks, with these words. Read themattentively and judge yourselves which is the truth and which iscruel deceit. The life and service of a Cossack were always bondageand penal servitude. At the first call of the authorities a Cossackalways had to saddle his horse and ride out on campaign. All hismilitary equipment a Cossack had to provide with his own hardlyearned means. A Cossack is on service, his farm is going to rack andruin. Is such a condition fair? No, it must be altered for ever. THECOSSACKS MUST BE FREED FROM BONDAGE. The new People’s Soviet power iswilling to come to the assistance of the toiling Cossacks. It is onlynecessary that the Cossacks themselves should resolve to abolish theold order, that they should refuse submission to their slave-driverofficers, land-owners, rich men, that they should throw off thecursed yoke from their necks. Arise, Cossacks! Unite! The Council ofPeople’s Commissars calls upon you to enter a new, fresh, more happylife.“In November and December in Petrograd there were All-RussianCongresses of Soviets of Soldiers’, Workers’, and Peasants’ Deputies.These Congresses transferred all the authority in the differentlocalities into the hands of the Soviets, i.e., into the hands of menelected by the People. From now on there must be in Russia no rulersor functionaries who command the People from above and drive them.The People create the authority themselves. A General has no morerights than a soldier. All are equal. Consider, Cossacks, is thiswrong or right? We are calling upon you, Cossacks, to join this neworder and to create your own Soviets of Cossacks’ Deputies. To suchSoviets all the power must belong in the different localities. Not to_hetmans_ with the rank of General, but to the electedrepresentatives of the toiling Cossacks, to your own trustworthyreliable men.“The All-Russian Congresses of Soldiers’, Workers’, and Peasants’Deputies have passed a resolution to transfer all landowners’ landinto the possession of the toiling people. Is not that fair,Cossacks? The Kornilovs, Kaledins, Dutovs, Karaulovs, Bardizhes, alldefend with their whole souls the interests of the rich men, and theyare ready to drown Russia in blood if only the lands remain in thehands of the landowners. But you, the toiling Cossacks, do not yousuffer yourselves from poverty, oppression and lack of land? How manyCossacks are there who have more than 4-5 _dessiatins_ per head? Butthe landowners, who have thousands of _dessiatins_ of their own land,wish besides to get into their hands the lands of the Cossack Army.According to the new Soviet laws, the lands of Cossack landownersmust pass without compensation into the hands of the Cossack workers,the poorer Cossacks. You are being told that the Soviets wish to takeaway your lands from you. Who is frightening you? The rich Cossacks,who know that the Soviet AUTHORITY WISHES TO transfer the landowners’lands to you. Choose then, Cossacks, for whom will you stand: for theKornilovs and Kaledins, for the Generals and rich men, or for theSoviets of Peasants’, Soldiers’, Workers’ and Cossacks’ Deputies.“THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARS elected by the All-RussianCongress HAS PROPOSED TO ALL NATIONS AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE AND ANHONOURABLE DEMOCRATIC PEACE WITHOUT LOSS OR DETRIMENT TO ANY NATION.All the capitalists, landowners, Generals-Kornilovists have risenagainst the peaceful policy of the Soviets. The war was bringing themprofits, power, distinctions. And to you, Cossack privates? You wereperishing without reason, without purpose, like yourbrothers-soldiers and sailors. It will soon be three years and a halfthat this accursed war has gone on, a war devised by the capitalistsand landowners of all countries for their own profit, their worldrobberies. To the toiling Cossacks the war has only brought ruin anddeath. The war has drained all the resources from Cossack farm life.The only salvation for the whole of our country and for the Cossacksin  particular is a prompt and honest peace. The Council of People’sCommissars has declared to all Governments and peoples: We do notwant other people’s property, and we do not wish to give away ourown. Peace without annexations and without indemnities. Every nationmust decide its own fate. There must be no oppressing of one nationby another. Such is the honest, democratic, People’s peace which theCouncil of People’s Commissars is proposing to all Governments, toall peoples, allies and enemies. And the results are visible: ON THERUSSIAN FRONT AN ARMISTICE HAS BEEN CONCLUDED.“The soldier’s and the Cossack’s blood is not flowing there any more.Now, Cossacks, decide: do you wish to continue this ruinous,senseless, criminal slaughter? Then support the Cadets, the enemiesof the people, support Tchernov, Tseretelli, Skobeliev, who drove youinto the offensive of July 1st; support Kornilov, who introducedcapital punishment for soldiers and Cossacks at the front. BUT IF YOUWISH A PROMPT AND HONEST PEACE, THEN ENTER THE RANKS OF THE SOVIETSAND SUPPORT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARS.“Your fate, Cossacks, lies in your own hands. Our common foes, thelandowners, capitalists, officers-Kornilovists, bourgeois newspapers,are deceiving you and driving you along the road to ruin. InOrenburg, Dutov has arrested the Soviet and disarmed the garrison.Kaledin is threatening the Soviets in the province of the Don. He hasdeclared the province to be in a state of war and is assembling histroops. Karaulov is shooting the local tribes in the Caucasus. TheCadet bourgeoisie is supplying them with its millions. Their commonaim is to suppress the People’s Soviets, to crush the workers andpeasants, to introduce again the discipline of the whip in the army,and to eternalise the bondage of the toiling Cossacks.“Our revolutionary troops are moving to the Don and the Ural in orderto put an end to this criminal revolt against the people. Thecommanders of the revolutionary troops have received orders not toenter into any negotiations with the mutinous Generals, to actdecisively and mercilessly.“Cossacks! On you depends now whether your brothers’ blood is to flowstill. We are holding out our hand to you. Join the whole peopleagainst its enemies. Declare Kaledin, Kornilov, Dutov, Karaulov andall their aiders and abettors to be the enemies of the people,traitors and betrayers. Arrest them with your own forces and turnthem over into the hands of the Soviet authority, which will judgethem in open and public Revolutionary Tribunal. Cossacks! FormSoviets of Cossacks’ Deputies. Take into your toil-worn hands themanagement of all the affairs of the Cossacks. Take away the lands ofyour own wealthy landowners. Take over their grain, their inventoriedproperty and live-stock for the cultivation of the lands of thetoiling Cossacks, who are ruined by the war.“Forward, Cossacks, to the fight for the common cause of the people!“Long live the toiling Cossacks!“Long live the union of the Cossacks, the soldiers, peasants andworkers!“Long live the power of the Soviets of Cossacks’, Soldiers’, Workers’and Peasants’ Deputies.“Down with the war! Down with the landowners and theKornilovist-Generals!“Long live Peace and the Brotherhood of peoples!”                                _Council of People’s Commissars._                                17.    FROM THE COMMISSION ON PUBLIC EDUCATION ATTACHED TO THE CENTRAL                            CITY DUMA“Comrades Workingmen and Workingwomen!“A few days before the holidays, a strike has been declared by theteachers of the public schools. The teachers side with thebourgeoisie against the Workers’ and Peasants’ Government.“Comrades, organise parents’ committees and pass resolutions againstthe strike of the teachers. Propose to the Ward Soviets of Workers’and Soldiers’ Deputies, the Trade Unions, the Factory-Shop and PartyCommittees, to organise protest meetings. Arrange with your ownresources Christmas trees and entertainments for the children, anddemand the opening of the schools, after the holidays, at the datewhich will be set by the Duma.“Comrades, strengthen your position in matters of public education,insist on the control of the proletarian organisations over theschools.”      _Commission on Public Education attached to the Central City Duma._                                18.        DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENTThe notes issued by Trotzky to the Allies and to the neutral powers,as well as the note of the Allied military Attachés to GeneralDukhonin, are too voluminous to give here. Moreover they belong toanother phase of the history of the Soviet Republic, with which thisbook has nothing to do—the foreign relations of the SovietGovernment. This I treat at length in the next volume, “Kornilov toBrest-Litovsk.”                                19.                APPEALS TO THE FRONT AGAINST DUKHONIN“… The struggle for peace has met with the resistance of thebourgeoisie and the counter-revolutionary Generals…. From theaccounts in the newspapers, at the _Stavka_ of former SupremeCommander Dukhonin are gathering the agents and allies of thebourgeoisie, Verkhovski, Avksentiev, Tchernov, Gotz, Tseretelli, etc.It seems even that they want to form a new power against the Soviets.“Comrades soldiers! All the persons we have mentioned have beenMinisters already. They have acted in accord with Kerensky and thebourgeoisie. They are responsible for the offensive of July 1st andfor the prolongation of the war. They promised the land to thepeasants and then arrested the Land Committees. They reestablishedcapital punishment for soldiers. They obey the orders of French,English and American financiers….“General Dukhonin, for having refused to obey orders of the Councilof People’s Commissars, has been dismissed from his position asSupreme Commander…. For answer he is circulating among the troops thenote from the Military Attachés of the Allied imperialist Powers, andattempting to provoke a counter-revolution….“Do not obey Dukhonin! Pay no attention to his provocation! Watch himand his group of counter-revolutionary Generals carefully….”                                20.                            FROM KRYLENKO                           _Order Number Two_“… The ex-Supreme Commander, General Dukhonin, for having opposedresistance to the execution of orders, for criminal actionsusceptible of provoking a new civil war, is declared enemy of thePeople. All persons who support Dukhonin will be arrested, withoutrespect to their social or political position or their past. Personsequipped with special authority will operate these arrests. I chargeGeneral Manikhovsky with the execution of the above-mentioneddispositions….”                     APPENDIX TO CHAPTER XII                                 1.                     INSTRUCTION TO PEASANTSIn answer to the numerous enquiries coming from peasants, it ishereby explained that the whole power in the country is from now onheld by the Soviets of the Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’Deputies. The Workers’ Revolution, after having conquered inPetrograd and in Moscow, is now conquering in all other centres ofRussia. The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government safeguards theinterests of the masses of peasantry, the poorest of them; it is withthe majority of peasants and workers against the landowners, andagainst the capitalists.Hence the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, and before all the DistrictSoviets, and subsequently those of the Provinces, are from now on anduntil the Constituent Assembly meets, full-powered bodies of Stateauthority in their localities. All landlords’ titles to the land arecancelled by the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets. A decreeregarding the land has already been issued by the present ProvisionalWorkers’ and Peasants’ Government. On the basis of the above decreeall lands hitherto belonging to landlords now pass entirely andwholly into the hands of the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies. The_Volost_ (a group of several villages forms a _Volost_) LandCommittees are immediately to take over all land from the landlords,and to keep a strict account over it, watching that order bemaintained, and that the whole estate be well guarded, seeing thatfrom now on all private estates become public property and musttherefore be protected by the people themselves.All orders given by the _Volost_ Land Committees, adopted with theassent of the District Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, in fulfilmentof the decrees issued by the revolutionary power, are absolutelylegal and are to be forthwith and irrefutably brought into execution.The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government appointed by the secondAll-Russian Congress of Soviets has received the name of the Councilof People’s Commissars.The Council of People’s Commissars summons the Peasants to take thewhole power into their hands in every locality.The workers will in every way absolutely and entirely support thepeasants, arrange for them all that is required in connection withmachines and tools, and in return they request the peasants to helpwith the transport of grain.                  _President of the Council of People’s Commissars,_                                       V. ULIANOV (LENIN).Petrograd, November 18th, 1917.                                 2.The full-powered Congress of Peasants’ Soviets met about a weeklater, and continued for several weeks. Its history is merely anexpanded version of the history of the “Extraordinary Conference.” Atfirst the great majority of the delegates were hostile to the SovietGovernment, and supported the reactionary wing. Several days laterthe assembly was supporting the moderates with Tchernov. And severaldays after that the vast majority of the Congress were voting for thefaction of Maria Spiridonova, and sending their representatives intothe _Tsay-ee-kah_ at Smolny…. The Right Wing then walked out of theCongress and called a Congress of its own, which went on, dwindlingfrom day to day, until it finally dissolved….THE JUNIOR CLASSICSSELECTED AND ARRANGED BYWILLIAM PATTEN, MANAGING EDITOR OF THE HARVARD CLASSICSINTRODUCTION BY CHARLES W. ELIOT, LL.D., PRESIDENT EMERITUS OF HARVARDUNIVERSITYWITH A READING GUIDE BY WILLIAM ALLAN NEILSON, Ph. D., PROFESSOR OFENGLISH, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, PRESIDENT SMITH COLLEGE, NORTHAMPTON,MASS., SINCE 1917VOLUME ONEFairy and Wonder TalesINTRODUCTIONThe purpose of The Junior Classics is to provide, in ten volumescontaining about five thousand pages, a classified collection of tales,stories, and poems, both ancient and modern, suitable for boys andgirls of from six to sixteen years of age.  Thoughtful parents andteachers, who realize the evils of indiscriminate reading on the partof children, will appreciate the educational value of such acollection.  A child's taste in reading is formed, as a rule, in thefirst ten or twelve years of its life, and experience has shown thatthe childish mind will prefer good literature to any other, if accessto it is made easy, and will develop far better on literature of provedmerit than on trivial or transitory material.The boy or girl who becomes familiar with the charming tales and poemsin this collection will have gained a knowledge of literature andhistory that will be of high value in other school and home work.  Hereare the real elements of imaginative narration, poetry, and ethics,which should enter into the education of every English-speaking child.This collection, carefully used by parents and teachers with duereference to individual tastes and needs, will make many children enjoygood literature.  It will inspire them with a love of good reading,which is the best possible result of any elementary education.  Thechild himself should be encouraged to make his own selections from thislarge and varied collection, the child's enjoyment being the object inview.  A real and lasting interest in literature or in scholarship isonly to be developed through the individual's enjoyment of his mentaloccupations.The most important change which has been made in American schools andcolleges within my memory is the substitution of leading for driving,of inspiration for drill, of personal interest and love of work forcompulsion and fear.  The schools are learning to use methods andmaterials which interest and attract the children themselves.  TheJunior Classics will put into the home the means of using this happymethod.Committing to memory beautiful pieces of literature, either prose orpoetry, for recitation before a friendly audience, acting charades orplays, and reading aloud with vivacity and sympathetic emotion, aregood means of instruction at home or at school This collection containsnumerous admirable pieces of literature for such use.  In teachingEnglish and English literature we should place more reliance uponprocesses and acts which awaken emotion, stimulate interest, prove tobe enjoyable for the actors, and result in giving children the power ofentertaining people, of blessing others with noble pleasures which thechildren create and share.>From the home training during childhood there should result in thechild a taste for interesting and improving reading which will directand inspire its subsequent intellectual life.  The training whichresults in this taste for good reading, however unsystematic oreccentric it may have been, has achieved one principal aim ofeducation; and any school or home training which does not result inimplanting this permanent taste has failed in a very important respect.Guided and animated by this impulse to acquire knowledge and exercisethe imagination through good reading, the adult will continue toeducate him all through life.The story of the human race through all its slow development should begradually conveyed to the child's mind from the time he begins to read,or to listen to his mother reading; and with description of facts andactual events should be mingled charming and uplifting products of theimagination.  To try to feed the minds of children upon facts alone isundesirable and unwise.  The immense product of the imagination in artand literature is a concrete fact with which every educated human beingshould be made somewhat familiar, that product being a very real partof every individual's actual environment.The right selection of reading matter for children is obviously of highimportance.  Some of the mythologies, Old Testament stories, fairytales, and historical romances, on which earlier generations wereaccustomed to feed the childish mind, contain a great deal that isbarbarous, perverse, or cruel; and to this infiltration into children'sminds, generation after generation, of immoral, cruel, or foolish ideasis probably to be attributed in part the slow ethical progress of therace.  The commonest justification of this thoughtless practice is thatchildren do not apprehend the evil in the bad mental pictures withwhich we foolishly supply them; but what should we think of a motherwho gave her children dirty milk or porridge, on the theory that thechildren would not assimilate the dirt?  Should we be less carefulabout mental and moral food materials?  The Junior Classics have beenselected with this principle in mind, without losing sight of the factthat every developing human being needs to have a vision of the roughand thorny road over which the human race has been slowly advancingduring thousands of years.Whoever has committed to memory in childhood such Bible extracts asGenesis i, the Ten Commandments, Psalm xxiii, Matthew v, 8-12, TheLord's Prayer, and I Corinthians xiii, such English prose as Lincoln'sGettysburg speech, Bacon's "Essay on Truth," and such poems as Bryant's"Waterfowl," Addison's "Divine Ode," Milton's Sonnet on his Blindness,Wotton's "How happy is he born or taught," Emerson's "Rhodora,"Holmes's "Chambered Nautilus," and Gray's Elegy, and has stamped themon his brain by frequent repetition, will have set up in his mind highstandards of noble thought and feeling, true patriotism, and purereligion.  He will also have laid in an invaluable store of goodEnglish.While the majority of the tales and poems are intended for children whohave begun to do their own reading, there will be found in every volumeselections fit for reading aloud to younger children.  Throughout thecollection the authors tell the stories in their own words; so that thesalt which gave them savor is preserved.  There are some condensationshowever, such as any good teller of borrowed stories would make; but asa rule condensation has been applied only in the case of long workswhich otherwise could not have been included.  The notes which precedethe condensations supply explanations, and answer questions whichexperience has shown boys and girls are apt to ask about the workscondensed or their authors.The Junior Classics constitute a set of books whose contents willdelight children and at the same time satisfy the legitimate ethicalrequirements of those who have the children's best interests at heart.Charles W.

There must have been fairy tales (or fables, or folktales, or myths, or whatever name we choose to give them) ever sincethe world began.  They are not exclusively French, German, Greek,Russian, Indian or Chinese, but are the common property of the wholehuman family and are as universal as human speech.All the world over, fairy tales are found to be pretty much the same.The story of Cinderella is found in all countries.  Japan has a Rip VanWinkle, China has a Beauty and the Beast, Egypt has a Puss in Boots,and Persia has a Jack and the Beanstalk.Those wise people who have made a careful study of literature, andespecially of what we call folk tales or fairy tales or fables ormyths, tell us that they all typify in some way the constant strugglethat is going on in every department of life.  It may be the struggleof Summer against Winter, the bright Day against dark Night, Innocenceagainst Cruelty, of Knowledge against Ignorance.  We are not obliged tothink of these delightful stories as each having a meaning.  Ourenjoyment of them will not be less if we overlook that side, but it mayhelp us to understand and appreciate good books if we remember that theliterature of the world is the story of man's struggle against nature;that the beginnings of literature came out of the mouths of story-tellers, and that the stories they told were fairy tales-imaginativestories based on truth.There is one important fact to remember in connection with the oldfairy tales, and that is that they were repeated aloud from memory, notread from a book or manuscript.The printing of books from type may be said to date from the year 1470,when Caxton introduced printing into England.  It is said that thefirst book printed in English which had the pages numbered was a bookof tales, "Aesop's Fables."As late as 1600 printed books were still so rare that only rich mencould own them.  There was one other way of printing a story-onsheepskin (split and made into parchment) with a pen-but that was along and laborious art that could only be practiced by educated men whohad been taught to write.  The monks were about the only men who hadthe necessary education and time, and they cared more for making copiesof the Bible and Lives of the Saints than they did of fairy tales.  Thecommon people, and even kings and queens, were therefore obliged todepend upon the professional story-teller.Fairy tales were very popular in the Middle Ages.  In the long wintermonths fields could not be cultivated, traveling had to be abandoned,and all were kept within doors by the cold and snow.  We know what theknight's house looked like in those days.  The large beamed hail orliving room was the principal room.  At one end of it, on a lowplatform, was a table for the knight, his family, and any visitingknights and ladies.  At the other tables on the main floor were thearmed men, like squires and retainers, who helped defend the castlefrom attack, and the maids of the household.The story-teller, who was sometimes called a bard or skald or minstrel,had his place of honor in the center of the room, and when the meal wasover he was called upon for a story.  These story-tellers became veryexpert in the practice of their art, and some of them could arousetheir audiences to a great pitch of excitement.  In the note thatprecedes the story "The Treason of Ganelon," in the volume "Heroes andHeroines of Chivalry," you can see how one of these story-tellers, orminstrels, sang aloud a story to the soldiers of William the Conquerorto encourage them as he led them into battle.The fairy tales collected by the Brothers Grimm were first published in1812.  They spent thirteen years collecting them, writing them down asthey were told by the peasants in Hesse, a mountainous province ofGermany lying far removed from the great main roads.Their friends helped them, but their best friend was the wife of acowherd, a strong, intelligent woman of fifty, who had a perfect geniusfor storytelling.  She knew she told the stories well, and that notmany had her gift.  The Grimms said that though she repeated a storyfor them three times, the variations were so slight as to be hardlyapparent.The American Indian stories of Manabozho the Mischief-Maker and hisadventures with the Wolf and the Woodpeckers and the Ducks werecollected in very much the same way by Henry R. Schoolcraft (1793-1864), the explorer and traveler, who lived among the Indian tribes forthirty years.Mrs. Steel has told us how she collected her Hindu stories, oftenlistening over and over to poor story-tellers who would spoil a storyin trying to tell it, until one day her patience would be rewarded byhearing it from the lips of the best storyteller in the village, whowas generally a boy.As all nations have their fairy tales, you will find in this collectionexamples of English, Irish, French, German, Scandinavian, Icelandic,Russian, Polish, Serbian, Spanish, Arabian, Hindu, Chinese, andJapanese fairy tales, as well as those recited around the lodge firesat night by American Indians for the entertainment of the red childrenof the West.I hope the work may prove for many a boy and girl (of any age up to ahundred) the Golden Bridge over which they can plunge into thatmarvelous world of fairies, elves, goblins, kobolds, trolls, afreets,jinns, ogres, and giants that fascinates us all, lost to this worldtill some one wakes us up to say "Bedtime!"Such excursions fill the mind with beautiful fancies and help todevelop that most precious of our faculties, the imagination.WILLIAM PATTEN.MANABOZHO, THE MISCHIEF-MAKERAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftTHERE was never in the whole world a more mischievous busybody thanthat notorious giant Manabozho.  He was everywhere, in season and outof season, running about, and putting his hand in whatever was goingforward.To carry on his game he could take almost any shape he pleased.  Hecould be very foolish or very wise, very weak or very strong, very richor very poor-just as happened to suit his humor best.  Whatever anyoneelse could do, he would attempt without a moment's reflection.  He wasa match for any man he met, and there were few manitoes*  (*goodspirits or evil spirits) that could get the better of him.  By turns hewould be very kind or very cruel, an animal or a bird, a man or aspirit, and yet, in spite of all these gifts, Manabozho was alwaysgetting himself involved in all sorts of troubles.  More than once, inthe course of his adventures, was this great maker of mischief drivento his wits' ends to come off with his life.To begin at the beginning, Manabozho, while yet a youngster, was livingwith his grandmother near the edge of a great prairie.  It was on thisprairie that he first saw animals and birds of every kind; he alsothere made first acquaintance with thunder and lightning.  He would sitby the hour watching the clouds as they rolled by, musing on the shadesof light and darkness as the day rose and fell.For a stripling, Manabozho was uncommonly wide-awake.  Every sight hebeheld in the heavens was a subject of remark, every new animal or birdan object of deep interest, and every sound was like a new lesson whichhe was expected to learn.  He often trembled at what he heard and saw.The first sound he heard was that of the owl, at which he was greatlyterrified, and, quickly descending the tree he had climbed, he ran withalarm to the lodge.  "Noko! noko! grandmother!" he cried.  "I haveheard a monedo."She laughed at his fears, and asked him what kind of a noise it made.He answered.  "It makes a noise like this: ko-ko-ko-ho!"His grandmother told him he was young and foolish; that what he heardwas only a bird which derived its name from the peculiar noise it made.He returned to the prairie and continued his watch.  As he stood therelooking at the clouds he thought to himself, "It is singular that I amso simple and my grandmother so wise; and that I have neither fathernor mother.  I have never heard a word about them.  I must ask and findout."He went home and sat down, silent and dejected.  Finding that this didnot attract the notice of his grandmother, he began a loud lamentation,which he kept increasing, louder and louder, till it shook the lodgeand nearly deafened the old grandmother."Manabozho, what is the matter with you?" she said, "you are making agreat deal of noise."Manabozho started off again with his doleful hubbub, but succeeded injerking out between his big sobs, "I haven't got any father nor mother,I haven't."Knowing that he was of a wicked and revengeful nature, his grandmotherdreaded to tell him the story of his parentage, as she knew he wouldmake trouble of it.Manabozho renewed his cries and managed to throw out for a third orfourth time, his sorrowful lament that he was a poor unfortunate whohad no parents or relatives.At last she said to him, to quiet him, "Yes, you have a father andthree brothers living.  Your mother is dead.  She was taken for a wifeby your father, the West, without the consent of her parents.  Yourbrothers are the North, East, and South; and being older than you yourfather has given them great power with the winds, according to theirnames.  You are the youngest of his children.  I have nursed you fromyour infancy, for your mother died when you were born.""I am glad my father is living," said Manabozho, "I shall set out inthe morning to visit him."His grandmother would have discouraged him, saying it was a longdistance to the place where his father, Ningabinn, or the West, lived.This information seemed rather to please than to discourage Manabozho,for by this time he had grown to such a size and strength that he hadbeen compelled to leave the narrow shelter of his grandmother's lodgeand live out of doors.  He was so tall that, if he had been sodisposed, he could have snapped off the heads of the birds roosting onthe topmost branches of the highest trees, as he stood up, withoutbeing at the trouble to climb.  And if he had at any time taken a fancyto one of the same trees for a walking stick, he would have had no moreto do than to pluck it up with his thumb and finger and strip down theleaves and twigs with the palm of his hand.Bidding good-by to his old grandmother, who pulled a very long faceover his departure, Manabozho set out at a great pace, for he was ableto stride from one side of a prairie to the other at a single step.He found his father on a high mountain far in the west.  His fatherespied his approach at a great distance, and bounded down themountainside several miles to give him welcome.  Apparently delightedwith each other, they reached in two or three of their giant paces thelodge of the West which stood high up near the clouds.They spent some days in talking with each other-for these two greatpersons did nothing on a small scale, and a whole day to deliver asingle sentence, such was the immensity of their discourse, was quitean ordinary affair.One evening Manabozho asked his father what he was most afraid of onearth.He replied-"Nothing.""But is there nothing you dread here-nothing that would hurt you if youtook too much of it?  Come, tell me."Manabozho was very urgent, so at last his father said: "Yes, there is ablack stone to be found a couple of hundred miles from here, over thatway," pointing as he spoke.  "It is the only thing on earth I am afraidof, for if it should happen to hit me on any part of my body it wouldhurt me very much."  The West made this important circumstance known toManabozho in the strictest confidence."Now you will not tell anyone, Manabozho, that the black stone is badmedicine for your father, will you?"  he added.  "You are a good son,and I know you will keep it to yourself.  Now tell me, my darling boy,is there not something that you don't like?"Manabozho answered promptly-"Nothing."His father, who was of a steady and persevering nature, put the samequestion to him seventeen times, and each time Manabozho made the sameanswer-' 'Nothing."But the West insisted-"There must be something you are afraid of.""Well, I will tell you," said Manabozho, "what it is."He made an effort to speak, but it seemed to be too much for him."Out with it," said the West, fetching Manabozho such a blow on theback as shook the mountain with its echo."Je-ee, je-ee-it is," said Manabozho, apparently in great pain.  "Yes,yes!  I cannot name it, I tremble so."The West told him to banish his fears, and to speak up; no one wouldhurt him.  Manabozho began again, and he would have gone over the samemake-believe of pain, had not his father, whose strength he knew wasmore than a match for his own, threatened to pitch him into a riverabout five miles off.  At last he cried out:"Father, since you will know, it is the root of the bulrush."  He whocould with perfect ease spin a sentence a whole day long, seemed to beexhausted by the effort of pronouncing that one word, "bulrush."Some time after Manabozho observed: "I will get some of the black rock,merely to see how it looks.""Well," said the father, "I will also get a little of the bulrush root,to learn how it tastes."They were both double-dealing with each other, and in their heartsgetting ready for some desperate work.  They had no sooner separatedfor the evening than Manabozho was striding off the couple of hundredmiles necessary to bring him to the place where the black rock was tobe procured, while down the other side of the mountain hurriedNingabinn, the West.At the break of day they each appeared at the great level on themountain-top, Manabozho with twenty loads, at least, of the blackstone, on one side, and on the other the West, with a whole meadow ofbulrush in his arms.Manabozho was the first to strike-hurling a great piece of the blackrock, which struck the West directly between the eyes, and he returnedthe favor with a blow of bulrush that rung over the shoulders ofManabozho, far and wide, like the long lash of the lightning among theclouds.First one and then the other, Manabozho poured in a tempest of blackrock, while the West discharged a shower of bulrush.  Blow upon blow,thwack upon thwack-they fought hand to hand until black rock andbulrush were all gone.  Then they betook themselves to hurling crags ateach other, cudgeling with huge oak trees, and defying each other fromone mountain top to another; while at times they shot enormous bouldersof granite across at each other's heads, as though they had been merejackstones.  The battle, which had commenced on the mountains, hadextended far west.  The West was forced to give ground.  Manabozhopressing on, drove him across rivers and mountains, ridges and lakes,till at last he got him to the very brink of the world."Hold!" cried the West.  "My son, you know my power, and although Iallow I am now fairly out of breath, it is impossible to kill me.  Stopwhere you are, and I will also portion you out with as much power asyour brothers.  The four quarters of the globe are already occupied,but you can go and do a great deal of good to the people of the earth,which is beset with serpents, beasts and monsters, who make great havocof human life.  Go and do good, and if you put forth half the strengthyou have to-day, you will acquire a name that will last forever.  Whenyou have finished your work I will have a place provided for you.  Youwill then go and sit with your brother, Kabinocca, in the north."Manabozho gave his father his hand upon this agreement.  And partingfrom.  him, he returned to his own grounds, where he lay for some timesore of his wounds.WHY THE WOODPECKER HAS RED HEAD FEATHERSAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftWHEN his wounds had all been cured by his grandmother's skill inmedicine, Manabozho, as big and sturdy as ever, was ripe for newadventures.  He set his thoughts immediately upon a war excursionagainst the Pearl Feather, a wicked old manito, living on the otherside of the great lake, who had killed his grandfather.He began his preparations by making huge bows and arrows withoutnumber, but he had no arrow heads.  At last his grandmother, Noko, toldhim that an old man who lived at some distance could furnish him withsome, and he sent her to get them.  Though she returned with herwrapper full, he told her that he had not enough and sent her again formore.In the meanwhile he thought to himself, "I must find out the way ofmaking these heads."Instead of directly asking how it was done, he preferred-just likeManabozho-to deceive his grandmother, in order to learn what he wantedby a trick.  "Noko," said he, "while I take my drum and rattle, andsing my war songs, do you go and try to get me some larger heads, forthese you have brought me are all of the same size.  Go and see whetherthe old man is not willing to make some a little larger."He followed her at a distance as she went, having left his drum at thelodge, with a great bird tied at the top, whose fluttering wings shouldkeep up the drumbeat, the same as if he were standing there beating thedrum himself.  He saw the old workman busy, and learned how he preparedthe heads; he also beheld the old man's daughter, who was verybeautiful.  Manabozho discovered for the first time that he had a heartof his own, and the sigh he heaved passed through the arrow maker'slodge like a young gale of wind."My how it blows!" said the old man."It must be from the south, though," said the daughter, "it is sofragrant."Manabozho slipped away, and in two strides he was at home, shoutingforth his songs as though he had never left the lodge.  He had justtime to untie the bird which had been beating the drum when hisgrandmother came in and gave him the big arrowheads.In the evening the grandmother said, "My son, you ought to fast beforeyou go to war, as your brothers do, to find out whether you will besuccessful or not."He said he had no objection.  Having privately stored away in a shadyplace in the forest two or three dozen juicy bears, a moose, and twentystrings of the tenderest birds, he would retire from the lodge so faras to be entirely out of view of his grandmother and fall to and enjoyhimself heartily.  At nightfall, having dispatched a dozen birds andhalf a bear or so, he would return, tottering and forlorn, as if quitefamished, so as to make his grandmother feel sorry for him.When he had finished his term of fasting, in the course of which heslyly dispatched twenty fat bears, six dozen birds, and two fine moose,Manabozho sung his war song and embarked in his canoe, fully preparedfor war.Besides his weapons he took along a large supply of oil.He traveled rapidly night and day, for he had only to will or speak,and the canoe went.  At length he arrived in sight of the fieryserpents, and stopped to study them.  He noticed that they were ofenormous length and of a bright color, that they were some distanceapart, and that the flames which poured forth from the mouths reachedacross the pass, so he said good morning and began talking with them ina very friendly way.  They were not to be deceived, however."We know you, Manabozho," they said, "you cannot pass."Turning his canoe as if about to go back, he suddenly cried out with aloud and terrified voice:  "WHAT IS THAT BEHIND YOU?"The serpents thrown off their guard, instantly turned their heads, andin a moment Manabozho glided silently past them."Well," said he, softly, after he had got by, "how about it?"He then took up his bow and arrows, and with deliberate aim shot everyone of them easily, for the serpents were fixed to one spot and couldnot even turn around.Having thus escaped the sentinel serpents, Manabozho pushed on in hiscanoe until he came to a part of the lake called Pitch-Water, aswhatever touched it was sure to stick fast.But Manabozho was prepared with his oil and, rubbing his canoe freelywith it, from end to end, he slipped through with ease-and he was thefirst person who had ever succeeded in passing through the Pitch-Water."Nothing like a little oil," said Manabozho to himself.Having by this time come in view of land, he could see the lodge of theShining Manito, high upon a distant hill.  At the dawn of day he puthis clubs and arrows in order and began his attack, yelling andshouting and beating his drum, and calling out so as to make it appearthat he had many followers:"Surround him! surround him! run up! run up!"He stalked bravely forward, shouting aloud, "It was you that killed mygrandfather," and shot off a whole forest of arrows.The Pearl Feather appeared on the height, blazing like the sun, andpaid back Manabozho with a tempest of bolts which rattled like hail.All day long the fight was kept up, and Manabozho had fired all of hisarrows but three without effect, for the Shining Manito was clothed inpure wampum.  It was only by immense leaps to right and left thatManabozho could save his head from the sturdy blows which fell abouthim on every side, like pine.trees, from the hands of the Manito.  Hewas badly bruised, and at his very wits' end, when a large Woodpeckerflew past and lit on a tree.  It was a bird he had known on theprairie, near his grandmother's lodge."Manabozho," called out the Woodpecker, "your enemy has a weak point;shoot at the lock of hair on the crown of his head."The first arrow he shot only drew a few drops of blood.  The Manitomade one or two unsteady steps, but recovered himself.  He began toparley, but Manabozho, now that he had discovered a way to reach him,was in no humor to trifle, and he let slip another arrow which broughtthe Shining Manito to his knees.  Having the crown of his head withingood range Manabozho shot his third arrow, and the Manito fell forwardupon the ground, dead.Manabozho called the Woodpecker to come and receive a reward for thetimely hint he had given him, and he rubbed the blood of the ShiningManito on the Woodpecker's head, the feathers of which are red to thisday.Full of his victory, Manabozho returned home, beating his war drumfuriously and shouting aloud his song of triumph.  His grandmother wason the shore to welcome him with the war dance, which she performedwith wonderful skill for one so far advanced in years.WHY THE DIVER DUCK HAS SO FEW TAIL FEATHERSAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftHAVING overcome the powerful Pearl Feather, killed his serpents andescaped all is wiles and charms, the heart of Manabozho welled withinhim.  An unconquerable desire for further adventures seized upon him.He had won in a great fight on land, so he determined -his next successshould come to him from the water.He tried his luck as a fisherman and with such success that he capturedan enormous fish, a fish so -rich in fat that with the oil Manabozhowas able to -form a small lake.  Wishing to be generous, and at thesame time having a cunning plan of his own, he invited all the birdsand beasts of his acquaintance to come and feast upon the oil, tellingthem that the order in which they partook of the banquet -would decidehow fat each was to be for all time to -come.As fast as they arrived he told them to plunge in and help themselves.The first to make his appearance was the bear, -who took a long andsteady draft; then came the deer, the opossum, and such others of thefamily as are noted for their comfortable covering.  The moose and thebuffalo were late in arriving on the scene, and the partridge, alwayslean in flesh, looked on till the supply was nearly gone.  There wasnot -a drop left by the time the hare and the marten appeared on theshore of the lake, and they are, in consequence, the slenderest of allcreatures.When this ceremony was over Manabozho suggested to his friends, theassembled birds and animals, that the occasion was proper for a littlemerrymaking; and taking up his drum he cried out:"New songs from the South! Come, brothers, dance!"They all fell in and commenced their rounds.  Whenever Manabozho, as hestood in the circle, saw a fat fowl which he fancied pass him, headroitly wrung its neck and slipped it under his belt, at the same timebeating his drum and singing at the top of his lungs to drown the noiseof the fluttering, crying out in a tone of admiration:"That's the way, my brothers; that's the way."  At last a small duck ofthe diver family, thinking there was something wrong, opened one eyeand saw what Manabozho was doing.  Giving a spring, and crying: "Ha-ha-a! Manabozho is killing us!" he made a dash for the water.Manabozho was so angry that the creature should have played the spythat he gave chase, and just as the Diver Duck was getting into thewater he gave him a kick, which is the reason that the diver's tailfeathers are few, his back flattened, and his legs straightened out, sothat when he is seen walking on land he makes a sorry looking figure.The other birds, having no ambition to be thrust in Manabozho's belt,flew off, and the animals scampered into the woods.MANAIBOZHO IS CHANGED INTO AWOLFAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftONE evening, as Manabozho was walking along the shore of a great lake,weary and hungry, he met a great magician in the form of an Old Wolf,with six young ones, coming toward him.The Wolf no Sooner caught sight of him than he told his whelps, whowere close beside him, to keep out of the way of Manabozho, "For Iknow," he said, "that it is that mischievous fellow whom we seeyonder."The young wolves were in the act of running off when Manabozho criedout, "My grandchildren, where are you going?  Stop and I will go withyou.  I wish to have a little chat with your excellent father."Saying which, he advanced and greeted the Old Wolf, expressing himselfas delighted at seeing him looking so well.  "Whither do you journey?"he asked."We are looking for a good hunting-ground to pass the winter," the OldWolf answered.  "What brings you here?"'I was looking for you," said Manabozho.  "For I have a passion for thechase, brother.  I always admired your family; are you willing tochange me into a wolf?"The Wolf gave him a favorable answer, and he was forthwith changed intoa wolf."Well, that will do," said Manabozho.  "But," he said, looking at histail, "could you oblige me by making my tail a little longer and morebushy, just a little more bushy?""Certainly," said the Old Wolf; and he straightway gave Manabozho sucha length and spread of tail that it was continually getting between hislegs, and it was so heavy that it was as much as he could do to carryit.  But, having asked for it, he was ashamed to say a word, and theyall started off in company, dashing up the ravine.After getting into the woods for some distance they ran across thetracks of moose.  The young ones scampered off in pursuit, the Old Wolfand Manabozho following at their leisure."Well," said the Old Wolf, by way of starting the conversation, "who doyou think is the fastest of the boys?  Can you tell by the jumps theytake?""Why," he replied, "that one that takes such 'long jumps, he is surelythe fastest.""Ha! ha! you are mistaken," said the Old Wolf.  "He makes a good start,but he will be the first to tire out; this one who appears to be behindwill be the one to kill the game."By this time they had come to the spot where the boys had started inchase.  One had dropped what seemed to be a small medicine-sack, whichhe carried for the use of the hunting party."Take that, Manabozho," said the Old Wolf."Why, what will I do with a dirty dog skin?"The Old Wolf took it up; it was a beautiful robe."Oh, I will carry it now," cried Manabozho."Oh, no," said the Wolf, who had used his magical powers, "it is a robeof pearls.  Come along!" And away he sped at a great rate of speed."Not so fast," called Manabozho after him; and then he added to himselfas he panted after, "Oh, this tail!"Coming to a place where the moose had lain down, they saw that theyoung wolves had made a fresh start after their prey.  "'Why," said theOld Wolf, "this moose is thin.  I know by the tracks.  I can alwaystell whether they are fat or not."  A little farther on, one of theyoung wolves, in dashing at the moose, had broken a tooth on a tree."Manabozho," said the Old Wolf, "one of your grandchildren has shot atthe game.  Take his arrow; there it is.""No," replied Manabozho, "what will I do with a dirty dog's tooth?"The Old Wolf took it up, and behold it was a beautiful silver arrow.When they at last overtook them, they found that the youngsters hadkilled a very fat moose.  Manabozho was very hungry, but the Old Wolfjust then again exerted his magical powers, and Manabozho saw nothingbut the bones picked quite clean.  He thought to himself, "Just as Iexpected; dirty, greedy fellows.  If it had not been for this log at myback I should have been in time to have got a mouthful"; and he cursedthe bushy tail which he carried to the bottom of his heart.The Old Wolf finally called out to one of the young ones, "Give somemeat to your grandfather."One of them obeyed, and coming near to Manabozho he presented him theend of his own bushy tail, which was now nicely seasoned with bursgathered in the course of the hunt.  Manabozho jumped up and calledout: "You dog, do you think I am going to eat you?" And he walked offin anger."Come back brother," cried the Wolf.  "You are losing your eyes.  Youdo the child injustice.  Look there I" and behold a heap of fresh meatwas lying on the spot, all prepared.Manabozho turned back, and at the sight of so much good food put on asmiling face.  "Wonderful!" he said, "how fine the meat is !""Yes," replied the Old Wolf, "it is always so with us; we know our workand always get the best.  It is not a long tail that makes the hunter."Manabozho bit his lip.MANABOZHO IS ROBBED BY THE WOLVESAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftSHORTLY after this the Old Wolf suggested to Manabozho that he shouldgo out and try his luck in hunting by himself.  When he chose to puthis mind to it he was quite expert, and this time he succeeded inkilling a fine fat moose which he thought he would take aside slyly anddevour alone.He was very hungry and he sat down to eat, but as he never could go towork in a straightforward way, he immediately fell into great doubts asto the proper point at which to begin."Well," said he, "I do not know where to commence.  At the head?  No,people will laugh, and say, 'He ate him backward.'"He went to the side.  "No," said he, "they will say I ate himsideways."He then went to the hind quarter.  "No, that will not do, either; theywill say I ate him forward.  I will begin here, say what they will."He took a delicate piece from the small of the back, and was just onthe point of putting it to his mouth when a tree close by made acreaking noise.  He seemed vexed at the sound.  He raised the morsel tohis mouth the second time, when the tree creaked again."Why," he exclaimed, "I cannot eat when I hear such a noise. "Stop,stop! " he cried to the tree.  He put down the morsel of meat,exclaiming.  "I CANNOT eat with such a noise," and starting away heclimbed the tree and was actually pulling at the limb which hadbothered him, when his forepaw was caught between the branches so thathe could not free himself.While thus held fast he saw a pack of wolves advancing through the woodin the direction of his meat.  He suspected them to be the Old Wolf andhis cubs, but night was coming on and he could not make them out.  "Gothe other way, go the other Way!" he cried out; "what do you expect toget here?"The Wolves stopped for a while and talked among themselves, and said:"Manabozho must have something there, or he would not tell us to goanother way. ""I begin to know know him," said the Old Wolf, "and all his tricks.Let us go forward and see." They came on and, finding the moose soonmade away with it.Manabozho looked wistfully on while they ate until they were fullysatisfied, when off they scampered in high spirits.  A heavy blast ofwind opened the branches finally, and released him.  The wolves hadleft nothing but bare bones.  He made for home.When he related his mishap, the Old Wolf, taking him by the forepaw,condoled with him deeply on his ill luck.  A tear even started to hiseye as he added: "My brother, this should teach us not to meddle withpoints of ceremony when we have good meat to eat."MANABOZHO AND THE WOODPECKERSAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftMANABOZHO lost the greater part of his magical power through lettinghis young wolf grandson fall through the thin ice and drown.  No oneknew where his grandmother had gone to.  He married the arrow maker'sdaughter, and became the father of several children, but he was verypoor and scarcely able to procure a living.  His lodge was pitched in adistant part of the country, where he could get no game, and it waswinter time.  One day he said to his wife, "I will go out walking andsee if I can find some lodges."After walking some time he finally discovered a lodge at a distance.There were children playing at the door, and when they saw himapproaching they ran in and told their parents Manabozho was coming.It was the home of the large Red-Headed Woodpecker.  He came to thedoor and asked Manabozho to enter, and the invitation was promptlyaccepted.  After some time the Woodpecker, who was a magician, said tohis wife: "Have you nothing to give Manabozho?  he must be hungry."She answered, "No.""He ought not to go without his supper," said the Woodpecker.  "I willsee what I can do."In the center of the lodge stood a large tamarack tree.  Upon this theWoodpecker flew, and commenced going up, turning his head on each sideof the tree, and every now and then driving in his bill.  At last hepulled something out of the tree and threw it down, when, behold, afine fat raccoon lay on the ground.  He drew out six or seven more, andthen came down and told his wife to prepare them."Manabozho," he said, "this is the only thing we eat; what else can wegive you?""It is very good," replied Manabozho.They smoked their pipes and conversed, and after a while Manabozho gotready to go home, so the Woodpecker said to his wife, "Give him theOther raccoons to take home for his children."In the act of leaving the lodge Manabozho on purpose dropped one of hismittens, which was soon after observed upon the ground.  "Run," saidthe Woodpecker to his eldest son, "and give it to him; but mind thatyou do not give it into his hand; throw it at him, for there is noknowing what he may do, he acts so curiously."The boy did as he was directed.  "Grandfather," he said, as he came upto him, "you have left one of your mittens, and here it is.""Yes," he said, making believe he did not know he had dropped it, "so Idid; but don't throw it, you will get it wet on the snow."The lad, however, threw it, and was about to return when Manabozhocried out, "Bakah! Bakah! Stop, stop; is that all you eat?  Do you eatnothing else with your raccoon?  Tell me!""Yes, that is all, answered the Young Woodpecker; "we have nothingelse.""Tell your father," continued Manabozho, "to come and visit me, and lethim bring a sack.  I will give him what he shall eat with his raccoonmeat."When the young one returned and reported this message to his father theOld Woodpecker turned up his nose at the invitation.  "I wonder," hesaid "what he thinks he has got, poor fellow!" He was bound, however,to answer the offer of hospitality, and he went accordingly, takingalong a cedar-sack, to pay a visit to Manabozho.Manabozho received the Old Red-Headed Woodpecker with great ceremony.He had stood at the door awaiting his arrival, and as soon as he camein sight Manabozho commenced, while he was yet far off, bowing andopening wide his arms, in token of welcome; all of which the Woodpeckerreturned in due form, by ducking his bill and hopping to right andleft, extending his wings to their full length and fluttering them backto his breast.When the Woodpecker at last reached the lodge Manabozho made severalremarks upon the weather, the appearance of the country, and especiallyspoke of the scarcity of game.  "But we," he added-"we always haveenough.  Come in, and you shall not go away hungry, my noble birds!"Manabozho had always prided himself on being able to give as good as hehad received; and to be up with the Woodpecker he had shifted his lodgeso as to inclose a large dry tamarack tree."What can I give you?" said he to the Woodpecker; "as we eat so shallyou eat."With this he hopped forward and, jumping on the tamarack tree, heattempted to climb it just as he had seen the Woodpecker do in his ownlodge.  He turned his head first on one side and then on the other, asthe Woodpecker does, striving to go up the tree, but as often slippingdown.  Every now and then he would strike the tree with his nose, as ifit was a bell, and draw back as if to pull something out of the tree,but he pulled out no raccoons.  He dashed his nose so often against thetrunk that at last the blood began to flow, and he tumbled downsenseless on the ground.The Woodpecker started up with his drum and rattle to restore him, andby beating them violently he succeeded in bringing him to.As soon as he came to his senses, Manabozho began to lay the blame ofhis failure upon his wife, saying to his guest: "Nemesho, it is thiswoman relation of yours-she is the cause of my not succeeding.  She hasmade me a worthless fellow.  Before I married her I also could getraccoons.The Woodpecker said nothing, but flying on the tree he drew out severalfine raccoons.  "Here," said he, "this is the way we do" and left himin disdain, carrying his bill high in the air, and stepping over thedoorsill as if it were not worthy to be touched by his toes.THE BOY AND THE WOLVESRetold by Andrew LangONCE upon a time an Indian hunter built himself a house in the middleof a great forest, far away from all his tribe; for his heart wasgentle and kind and he was weary of the treachery and cruel deeds ofthose who had been his friends.  So he left them and took his wife andthree children, and they journeyed on until they found a spot near to aclear stream, where they began to cut down trees and to make readytheir wigwam.  For many years they lived peacefully and happily in thissheltered place, never leaving it except to hunt the wild animals,which served them both for food and clothes.  At last, however, thestrong man fell sick, and before long lie knew he must die.  So hegathered his family round him and said his last words to them."You, my wife, the companion of my days, will follow me ere many moonshave waned to the island of the blessed.  But for you, 0 my children,whose lives are but newly begun, the wickedness, unkindness, andingratitude from which I fled are before you.  Yet I shall go hence inpeace, my children, if you will promise always to love each other andnever to forsake your youngest brother.""Never!" they replied, holding out their hands.  And the hunter diedcontent.Scarcely eight moons had passed when, just as he had said, the wifewent forth and followed her husband; but before leaving her childrenshe bade the two elder ones think of their promise never to forsake theyounger, for he was a child and weak.  And while the snow lay thickupon the ground they tended him and cherished him; but when the earthshowed green again the heart of the young man stirred within him, andhe longed to see the wigwams of the village where his father's youthwas spent.Therefore he opened all his heart to his sister, who answered: "Mybrother, I understand your longing for our fellow-men, whom here wecannot see.  But remember our father's words.  Shall we not seek ourown pleasures and forget the little one?"But he would not listen, and, making no reply, he took his bow andarrows and left the hut.  The snows fell and melted, yet he neverreturned, and at last the heart of the girl grew cold and hard and herlittle boy became a burden in her eyes, till one day she spoke thus tohim: "See, there is food for many days to come.  Stay here within theshelter of the hut.  I go to seek our brother, and when I have foundhim I shall return hither."But when, after hard journeying, she reached the village where herbrother dwelt and saw that he had a wife and was happy, and when she,too, was sought by a young brave, then she also forgot the boy alone inthe forest and thought only of her husband.Now as soon as the little boy had eaten all the food which his sisterhad left him, he went out into the woods and gathered berries and dugup roots, and while the sun shone he was contented and had his fill.But when the snows began and the wind howled, then his stomach feltempty and his limbs cold, and he hid in trees all the night and onlycrept out to eat what the wolves had left behind.  And by and by,having no other friends, he sought their company, and sat by while theydevoured their prey, and they grew to know him and gave him food.  Andwithout them he would have died in the snow.  But at last the snowsmelted and the ice upon the great lake, and as the wolves went down tothe shore the boy went after them.  And it happened one day that hisbig brother was fishing in his canoe near the shore, and he heard thevoice of a child singing in the Indian tone:	"My brother, my brother!	I am becoming a wolf,	I am becoming a wolf!"And when he had so sung he howled as wolves howl.  Then the heart ofthe elder sank and he hastened toward him, crying: "Brother, littlebrother, come to me;" but he, being half a wolf, only continued hissong.  And the louder the elder called him, "Brother, little brother,come to me," the swifter he fled after his brothers the wolves and theheavier grew his skin, till, with a long howl, he vanished into thedepths of the forest.So, with shame and anguish in his soul, the elder brother went back tohis village, and with his sister mourned the little boy and the brokenpromise till the end of his life.THE INDIAN WHO LOST HIS WIFERetold by Andrew LangONCE upon a time there was a man and his wife who lived in the forestfar from the rest of the tribe.  Very often they spent the day inhunting together, but after awhile the wife found that she had so manythings to do that she was obliged to stay at home; so he went alone,though he found that when his wife was not with him he never had anyluck.  One day, when he was away hunting, the woman fell ill, and in afew days she died.  Her husband grieved bitterly and buried her in thehouse where she had passed her life; but as the time went on he felt solonely without her that he made a wooden doll about her height amidsize for company and dressed it in her clothes.  He seated it in frontof the fire and tried to think he had his wife back again.  The nextday he went out to hunt, and when he came home the first thing he didwas to go up to the doll and brush off some of the ashes from the firewhich had fallen on its face.  But he was very busy now, for he had tocook and mend, besides getting food, for there was no one to help him.And so a whole year passed away.At the end of that time he came back from hunting one night and foundsome wood by the door and a fire within.  The next night there was notonly wood and fire, but a piece of meat in the kettle, nearly ready foreating.  He searched all about to see who could have done this, butcould find no one.  The next time he went to hunt he took care not togo far and came in quite early.  And while he was still a long way offhe saw a woman going into the house with wood on her shoulders.  So hemade haste and opened the door quickly, and instead of the wooden dollhis wife sat in front of the fire.  Then she spoke to him and said:"The Great Spirit felt sorry for you because you would not becomforted, so he let me come back to you, but you must not stretch outyour hand to touch me till we have seen the rest of our people.  If youdo I shall die."So the man listened to her words, and the woman dwelt there and broughtthe wood and kindled the fire, till one day her husband said to her:"It is now two years since you died.  Let us now go back to our tribe.Then you will be well and I can touch you."And with that he prepared food for the journey, a string of deer'sflesh for her to carry and one for himself; and so they started.  Now,the camp of the tribe was distant six days' journey, and when they wereyet one day's journey off it began to snow, and they felt weary andlonged for rest.  Therefore they made a fire, cooked some food, andspread out their skins to sleep.Then the heart of the man was greatly stirred and he stretched out hisarms to his wife, but she waved her hands and said:"We have seen no one yet.  It is too soon."But he would not listen to her and caught her to him, and behold! hewas clasping the wooden doll.  And when he saw it was the doll hepushed it from him in his misery and rushed away to the camp and toldthem all his story.  And some doubted, and they went back with him tothe place where he and his wife had stopped to rest, and there lay thedoll, and besides, they saw in time snow the steps of two people, andthe foot of one was like the foot of the doll.  And the man grievedsore all the days of his life.PUNCHKINBy E. FrereONCE upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was moreclever than the rest.  The Raja's wife died when they were quite littlechildren, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother totake care of them.The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinnerevery day, while he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on theaffairs of the nation.About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; andevery day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their father'sdinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg for alittle fire from the hearth.  Then Balna used to say to her sisters,"Send that woman away; send her away.  Let her get the fire at her ownhouse.  What does she want with ours?  If we allow her to come here, weshall suffer for it some day."But the other sisters would answer, "Be quiet, Balna; why must youalways be quarreling with this poor woman?  Let her take some fire ifshe likes."  Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and takea few sticks from it; and while no one was looking, she would quicklythrow some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being preparedfor the Raja's dinner.Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters.  Ever since their mother'sdeath they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order toavoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies.  So, when hefound the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise fromtheir carelessness, as it did not seem likely that anyone should haveput mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like toreprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeatedmany days.At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughterscooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room,and watched them through a hole in the wall.There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice andpreparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by thefire ready to be cooked.  Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come tothe door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinnerwith.  Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, "Why don't you keep fuelin your own house, and not come here every day and take ours?  Sisters,don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself."Then the eldest sister answered, "Balna, let the poor woman take thewood and the fire; she does us no harm."  But Balna replied, "If youlet her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make ussorry for it, some day."The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all hisdinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw alittle mud into each of the dishes.At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized andbrought before him.  But when the widow came, she told him that she hadplayed this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; andshe spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words,that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her hisRanee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace.Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to getthem, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter mighthave all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in theirplace; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her,she did all she could to make them miserable.  She gave them nothingbut bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water todrink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomedto have everything comfortable about them, and good food and goodclothes all their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and theyused to go out every day and sit by their dead mother's tomb and cry-and say:"O mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy weare, and how we are starved by our cruel stepmother?"One day, while they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! abeautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh,ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating someof the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat thebad dinner their stepmother provided for them, they used to go out totheir mother's grave and eat the pommels which grew there on thebeautiful tree.Then the Ranee said to her daughter, "I cannot tell how it is, everyday those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eatany; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better thanyou do.  I cannot tell how it is."   And she bade her watch the sevenPrincesses, and see if anyone gave them anything to eat.So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and wereeating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them,and saw them gathering the fruit.Then Balna said to her sisters, "Do you not see that girl watching us?Let us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tellher mother all about it, and that will be bad for us."But the other sisters said, "Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna.  The girlwould never be so cruel as to tell her mother.  Let us rather inviteher to come and have some of the fruit."  And calling her to them, theygave her one of the pomeloes.No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan's daughter wenthome and said to her mother, "I do not wonder the seven Princesses willnot eat the dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother's gravethere grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day andeat the pomeloes.  I ate one, and it was the nicest I have evertasted."The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day shestayed in her room, and told the Raja that she had a very bad headache.The Raja was deeply grieved, and said to his wife, "What can I do foryou?"   She answered, "There is only one thing that will make myheadache well.  By your dead wife's tomb there grows a fine pomelotree; you must bring that here, and boil it, root and branch, and put alittle of the water in which it has been boiled on my forehead, andthat will cure my headache."   So the Raja sent his servants, and hadthe beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Raneedesired; and when some of the water, in which it had been boiled, wasput on her forehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quitewell.Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of theirmother, the pomelo tree had disappeared.  Then they all began to cryvery bitterly.Now there was by the Ranee's tomb a small tank, and as they were cryingthey saw the tank was filled with a rich cream-like substance, whichquickly hardened into a thick white cake.  At seeing this all thePrincesses were very glad, and they ate some of the cake, and liked it;and next day the same thing happened, and so it went on for many days.Every morning the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and foundthe little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like cake.  Then thecruel stepmother said to her daughter: "I cannot tell how it is, I havehad the pomelo tree which used to grow by the Ranee's grave destroyed,and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor look more sad, though theynever eat the dinner I give them.  I cannot tell how it is!"And her daughter said, "I will watch."Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who shouldcome by but their stepmother's daughter.  Balna saw her first, andsaid, "See, sisters, there comes that girl again.  Let us sit round theedge of the tank and not allow her to see it, for if we give her someof our cake, she will go and tell her mother; and that will be veryunfortunate for us."The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious, andinstead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan's daughter someof the cake, and she went home and told her mother all about it.The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedinglyangry, and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee's tomb, andfill the little tank with the ruins.  And not content with this, shenext day pretended to be very, very ill-in fact, at the point of death-and when the Raja was much grieved, and asked her whether it was in hispower to procure her any remedy, she said to him: "Only one thing cansave my life, but I know you will not do it."  He replied, "Yes,whatever it is, I will do it."  She then said, "To save my life, youmust kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of theirblood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their death willbe my life."  At these words the Raja was very sorrowful; but becausehe feared to break his word, he went out with a heavy heart to find hisdaughters.He found them crying by the ruins of their mother's grave.Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Raja spoke kindly to them,and told them to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made afire and cooked some rice, and gave it to them.  But in the afternoon,it being very hot, the seven Princesses all fell asleep, and when hesaw they were fast asleep, the Raja, their father, stole away and leftthem (for he feared his wife), saying to himself: "It is better my poordaughters should die here, than be killed by their stepmother."He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some of its blood on theforehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he hadreally killed the Princesses, and said she felt quite well.Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves allalone in the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to callout as loud as they could, in hopes of making their father hear; but hewas by that time far away, and would not have been able to hear themeven had their voices been as loud as thunder.It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a neighboringRaja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as they werereturning home, after the day's sport was over, the youngest Princesaid to his brothers: "Stop, I think I hear some one crying and callingout.  Do you not hear voices?  Let us go in the direction of the sound,and find out what it is."So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the placewhere the seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands.  At thesight of them the young Princes were very much astonished, and stillmore so on learning their story; and they settled that each should takeone of these poor forlorn ladies home with him, and marry her.So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him,and married her.And the second took the second; and third took the third; and thefourth took the fourth; and the fifth took the fifth; and the sixthtook the sixth; and the seventh, and the handsomest of all, took thebeautiful Balna.And when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicingthroughout the kingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes toseven such beautiful Princesses.About a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles andaunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathersand seven mothers.  None of the other Princes and Princesses had anychildren, so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was acknowledgedtheir heir by all the rest.They had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day theseventh Prince (Balna's husband) said he would go out hunting, and awayhe went; and they waited long for him, but he never came back.Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become ofhim; and they went away, but they also did not return.And the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they feared that theirkind husbands must have been killed.One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna was rocking herbaby's cradle, and while her sisters were working in the room below,there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress, who saidthat he was a Fakir, and came to beg.  The servant said to him, "Youcannot go into the palace-the Raja's sons have all gone away; we thinkthey must be dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by yourbegging."  But he said, "I am a holy man, you must let me in.  Then thestupid servants let him walk through the palace, but they did not knowthat this was no Fakir, but a wicked Magician named Punchkin.Punchkin Fakir wandered through the palace, and saw many beautifulthings there, till at last he reached the room where Balna sat singingbeside her little boy's cradle.  The Magician thought her morebeautiful than all the other beautiful things he had seen, insomuchthat he asked her to go home with him and to marry him.  But she said,"My husband, I fear, is dead, but my little boy is still quite young; Iwill stay here and teach him to grow up a clever man, and when he isgrown up he shall go out into the world, and try and learn tidings ofhis father.  Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him, or marry yon."At these words the Magician was very angry, and turned her into alittle black dog, and led her away; saying, "Since yon will not comewith me of your own free will, I will make you."  So the poor Princesswas dragged away, without any power of effecting an escape, or ofletting her sisters know what had become of her.  As Punchkin passedthrough the palace gate the servants said to him, "Where did yon getthat pretty little dog?"  And he answered, "One of the Princesses gaveit to me as a present."  At hearing which they let him go withoutfurther questioning.Soon after this, the six elder Princesses heard the little baby, theirnephew, begin to cry, and when they went upstairs they were muchsurprised to find him all alone, and Balna nowhere to be seen.  Thenthey questioned the servants, and when they heard of the Fakir and thelittle black dog, they guessed what had happened, and sent in everydirection seeking them, but neither the Fakir nor the dog were to befound.  What could six poor women do?  They gave up all hopes of everseeing their kind husbands, and their sister, and her husband again,and devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care oftheir little nephew.Thus time went on, till Balna's son was fourteen years old.  Then, oneday, his aunts told him the history of the family; and no sooner did hehear it, than be was seized with a great desire to go in search of hisfather and mother and uncles, and if he could find them alive to bringthem home again.  His aunts, on learning his determination, were muchalarmed and tried to dissuade him, saying, "We have lost our husbands,and our sister and her husband, and you are now our sole hope; if yougo away, what shall we do?"  But he replied, "I pray you not to bediscouraged; I will return soon, and if it is possible bring my fatherand mother and uncles with me."  So he set out on his travels; but forsome months he could learn nothing to help him in his search.At last, after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles, andbecome almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his parents,he one day came to a country that seemed full of stones, and rocks, andtrees, and there he saw a large palace with a tower; hard by was aMalee's little house.As he was looking about, the Malee's wife saw him, and ran out of thehouse and said, "My dear boy, who are you that dare venture to thisdangerous place?"  He answered, "I am a Raja's son, and I come insearch of my father, and my uncles, and my mother whom a wickedenchanter bewitched."Then the Malee's wife said, "This country and this palace belong to agreat enchanter; he is all powerful, and if anyone displeases him, hecan turn them into stones and trees.  All the rocks and trees you seehere were living people once, and the Magician turned them to what theynow are.  Some time ago a Raja's son came here, and shortly afterwardcame his six brothers, and they were all turned into stones and trees;and these are not the only unfortunate ones, for up in that tower livesa beautiful Princess, whom the Magician has kept prisoner there fortwelve years, because she hates him and will not marry him."Then the little Prince thought, "These must be my parents and myuncles.  I have found what I seek at last."  So he told his story tothe Malee's wife, and begged her to help him to remain in that placeawhile and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she mentioned;and she promised to befriend him, and advised his disguising himselflest the Magician should see him, and turn him likewise into stone.  Tothis the Prince agreed.  So the Malee's wife dressed him up in a saree,and pretended that he was her daughter.One day, not long after this, as the Magician was walking in his gardenhe saw the little girl (as he thought) playing about, and asked her whoshe was.  She told him she was the Malee's daughter, and the Magiciansaid, "You are a pretty little girl, and to-morrow you shall take apresent of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in thetower."The young Prince was much delighted at hearing this, and wentimmediately to inform the Malee's wife; after consultation with whom hedetermined that it would be more safe for him to retain his disguise,and trust to the chance of a favorable opportunity for establishingsome communication with his mother, if it were indeed she.Now it happened that at Balna's marriage her husband had given her asmall gold ring on which her name was engraved, and she had put it onher little son's finger when he was a baby, and afterward when he wasolder his aunts had had it enlarged for him, so that he was still ableto wear it.  The Malee's wife advised him to fasten the well-knowntreasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother, and trustto her recognizing it.  This was not to be done without difficulty, assuch a strict watch was kept over the poor Princess (for fear of herever establishing communication with her friends), that though thesupposed Malee's daughter was permitted to take her flowers every day,the Magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the time.At last one day, however, opportunity favored him, and when no one waslooking the boy tied the ring to a nosegay, and threw it at Balna'sfeet.  It fell with a clang on the floor, and Balna, looking to seewhat made the strange sound, found the little ring tied to the flowers.On recognizing it, she at once believed the story her son told her ofhis long search, and begged him to advise her as to what she had betterdo; at the same time entreating him on no account to endanger his lifeby trying to rescue her.  She told him that for twelve long years theMagician had kept her shut up in the tower because she refused to marryhim, and she was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of release.Now Balna's son was a bright, clever boy, so he said, "Do not fear,dear mother; the first thing to do is to discover how far theMagician's power extends, in order that we may be able to liberate myfather and uncles, whom he has imprisoned in the form of the rocks andtrees.  You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years; nowrather speak kindly.  Tell him you have given up all hopes of againseeing the husband you have so long mourned, and say you are willing toharry him.  Then endeavor to find out what his power consists in, andwhether he is immortal, or can be put to death."Balna determined to take her son's advice; and the next day sent forPunchkin, and spoke to him as had been suggested.The Magician greatly delighted, begged her to allow the wedding to takeplace as soon as possible.But she told him that before she married him he must allow her a littlemore time, in which she might make his acquaintance, and that, afterbeing enemies so long, their friendship could but strengthen bydegrees.  "And do tell me," she said, "are you quite immortal?  Candeath never touch you?  And are you too great an enchanter ever to feelhuman suffering?""Why do you ask?" said he."Because," she replied.  "if I am to be your wife, I would fain knowall about you, in order, if any calamity threatens you, to overcome, orif possible to avert it.""It is true," he added, "that I am not as others.  Far, far away,hundreds of thousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate countrycovered with thick jungle.  In the midst of the jungle grows a circleof palm trees, and in the center of the circle stand six chattees fullof water, piled one above another: below the sixth chattee is a smallcage which contains a little green parrot; on the life of the parrotdepends my life; and if the parrot is killed I must die.  It is.however," he added, "impossible that the parrot should sustain anyinjury, both on account of the inaccessibility of the country, andbecause, by my appointment, many thousand genii surround the palmtrees, and kill all who approach the place."Balna told her son what Punchkin had said; but at the same timeimplored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot.The Prince, however, replied, "Mother, unless I can get hold of thatparrot, you, and my father, and uncles, cannot be liberated: be notafraid, I will shortly return.  Do you, meantime, keep the Magician ingood humor-still putting off your marriage with him on variouspretexts; and before he finds out the cause of delay, I will be here."So saying, he went away.Many, many weary miles did he travel, till at last he came to a thickjungle; and, being very tired, sat down under a tree and fell asleep.He was awakened by a soft rustling sound, and looking about him, saw alarge serpent which was making its way to an eagle's nest built in thetree under which he lay, and in the nest were two young eagles.  ThePrince seeing the danger of the young birds, drew his sword, and killedthe serpent; at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in the air,and the two old eagles, who had been out hunting for food for theiryoung ones, returned.  They quickly saw the dead serpent and the youngPrince standing over it; and the old mother eagle said to him, "Dearboy, for many' years all our young ones have been devoured by thatcruel serpent; you have now saved the lives of our children; wheneveryou are in need therefore, send to us and we will help you; and as forthese little eagles, take them, and let them be your servants."At this the Prince was very glad, and the two eaglets crossed theirwings, on which he mounted; and they carried him far, far away over thethick, jungles, until he came to the place where grew the circle ofpalm trees, in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of water.It was the middle of the day, and the heat was very great.  All roundthe trees were the genii fast asleep; nevertheless, there were suchcountless thousands of them, that it would have been quite impossiblefor anyone to walk through their ranks to the place; down swooped thestrong-winged eaglets-down jumped the Prince; in an instant he hadoverthrown the six chattees full of water, and seized the little greenparrot, which he rolled up in his cloak; while, as he mounted againinto the air, all the genii below awoke, and finding their treasuregone, set up a wild and melancholy howl.Away, away flew the little eagles, till they came to their home in thegreat tree; then the Prince said to the old eagles, "Take back yourlittle ones; they have done me good service; if ever again I stand inneed of help, I will not fail to come to you."  He then continued hisjourney on foot till he arrived once more at the Magician's palace,where he sat down at the door and began playing with the Parrot.Punchkin saw him, and came to him quickly, and said, "My boy, where didyon get that parrot?  Give it to me, I pray you."But the Prince answered, "Oh no, I cannot give away my parrot, it is agreat pet of mine; I have had it many years."Then the Magician said, "If it is an old favorite, I can understandyour not caring to give it away; but come, what will you sell it for?""Sir," said the Prince, "I will not sell my parrot."Then Punchkin got frightened, and said, "Anything, anything; name whatprice you will, and it shall be yours."  The Prince answered, "Let theseven Raja's sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantlyliberated.""It is done as you desire," said the Magician, "only give me myparrot."  And With that, by a stroke of his wand, Balna's husband andhis brothers resumed their natural shapes.  "Now, give me my parrot,"repeated Punchkin."Not so fast, my master," rejoined the Prince; "I must first beg thatyou will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned."The Magician immediately waved his wand again; and whilst he cried, inan imploring voice, "Give me my parrot!' the whole garden becamesuddenly alive: where rocks, and stones, and trees had been before,stood Rajas, and Punts, and Sirdars, and mighty men on prancing horses,and jeweled pages, and troops of armed attendants."Give me my parrot!" cried Punchkin.  Then the boy took hold of theparrot, and tore off one of its wings; and as he did so the Magician'sright arm fell off.Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, "Give me my parrot!"The Prince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the Magician's leftarm tumbled off."Give me my parrot!" cried he, and fell on his knees.  The Princepulled off the parrot's right leg, and the Magician's right leg felloff: the Prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell theMagician's left.Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but stillhe rolled his eyes, and cried "Give me my parrot!"  "Take your parrot,then, cried the boy, and with that.  he wrung the bird's neck, andthrew it at the magician; and as he did so, Punchkin's head twistedround and, with a fearful groan, he died!Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the sevenPrinces went to their own country, and lived very happily everafterward.  And as to the rest of the world, everyone went to his ownhouse.HOW SUN, MOON AND WIND WENT OUT TO DINNERBy E. FrereONE day Sun, Moon, and Wind went out to dine with their uncle and auntThunder and Lightning.  Their mother (one of the most distant Stars yousee far up in the sky) waited alone for her children's return.Now both Sun and Wind were greedy and selfish.  They enjoyed the greatfeast that had been prepared for them, without a thought of saving anyof it to take home to their mother-but the gentle Moon did not forgether.  Of every dainty dish that was brought round, she placed a smallportion under one of her beautiful long fingernails, that Star mightalso have a share in the treat.On their return, their mother, Who had kept watch for them all nightlong with her little bright eye, said, "Well, children, what have yonbrought home for me?"  Then Sun (who was eldest) said, "I have broughtnothing home for you.  I went out to enjoy myself with my friends-notto fetch dinner for my mother!"  And Wind said, "Neither have I broughtanything home for you, mother.  You could hardly expect me to bring acollection of good things for you, when I merely went out for my ownpleasure."  But Moon said, "Mother, fetch a plate, see what I havebrought you."  And shaking her hands she showered down such a choicedinner as never was seen before.Then Star turned to Sun and spoke thus, "Because you went out to amuseyourself with your friends, and feasted and enjoyed yourself, withoutany thought of our mother at home-you shall be cursed.  Henceforth,your rays shall ever be hot and scorching, and shall burn all that theytouch.  And men shall hate you, and cover their heads when you appear.(And that is why the Sun is so hot to this day.)Then she turned to Wind and said, "You also who forgot your mother inthe midst of your selfish pleasures-hear your doom.  You shall alwaysblow in the hot, dry weather, and shall parch and shrivel all livingthings.  And men shall detest and avoid you from this very time."(And that is why the Wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable.)But to Moon she said, "Daughter, because you remembered your mother,and kept for her a share in your own enjoyment, from henceforth youshall be ever cool, and calm and bright.  No noxious glare shallaccompany your pure rays, and men shall always call you 'blessed."(And that is why the Moon's light is so soft, and cool, and beautifuleven to this day.)WHY THE FISH LAUGHEDBy Joseph JacobsAs a certain fisherwoman passed by a palace crying her fish, the queenappeared at one of the windows and beckoned her to come near and showwhat she had.  At that moment a very big fish jumped about in thebottom of the basket."Is it a he or a she?"  inquired the queen.  "I wish to purchase a shefish."On hearing this the fish laughed aloud."It's a he," replied the fisherwoman, and proceeded on her rounds.The queen returned to her room in a great rage; and on coming to seeher in the evening, the king noticed that something had disturbed her."Are you indisposed?"  he said."No; but I am very much annoyed at the strange behavior of a fish.  Awoman brought me one to-day, and on my inquiring whether it was a maleor female, the fish laughed most rudely.""A fish laugh! Impossible! You must be dreaming.""I am not a fool.  I speak of what I have seen with my own eyes andheard with my own ears.""Passing strange! Be it so.  I will inquire concerning it."On the morrow the king repeated to his vizier what his wife had toldhim, and bade him investigate the matter, and be ready with asatisfactory answer within six mouths, on pain of death.  The vizierpromised to do his best, though he felt almost certain of failure.  Forlive months he labored indefatigably to find a reason for the laughterof the fish.  He sought everywhere and from everyone.  The wise andlearned, and they who were skilled in magic and in all manner oftrickery, were consulted.  Nobody, however, could explain the matter;and so he returned broken-hearted to his house, and began to arrangehis affairs in prospect of certain death, for he had had sufficientexperience of the king to know that His Majesty would not go back fromhis threat.  Amongst other things, he advised his son to travel for atime, until the king's anger should have somewhat cooled.The young fellow, who was both clever and handsome, started offwhithersoever Kismet might lead him.  He had been gone some days, whenhe fell in with an old farmer, who also was on a journey to a certainvillage.  Finding the old man very pleasant, he asked him if he mightaccompany him, professing to be on a visit to the same place.  The oldfarmer agreed, and they walked along together.  The day was hot, andthe way was long and weary."Don't yon think it would be pleasanter if you and I sometimes gave oneanother a lift?"  said the youth."What a fool the man is!" thought the old farmer.Presently they passed through a field of corn ready for the sickle, andlooking' like a sea of gold as it waved to and fro in the breeze."Is this eaten or not?"  said the young man.Not understanding his meaning, the old man replied, "I don't know."After a little while the two travelers arrived at a big village, wherethe young man gave his companion a clasp knife, and said, "Take this,friend, and get two horses with it; but mind and bring it back, for itis very precious."The old man, looking half amused and half angry, pushed back the knife,muttering something to the effect that his friend was either a foolhimself or else tying to play the fool with him.  The young manpretended not to notice his reply, and remained almost silent till theyreached the city, a short distance outside which was the old farmer'shouse.They walked about the bazaar and went to the mosque, but nobody salutedthem or invited them to come in and rest."What a large cemetery!" exclaimed the young man."What does the man mean," thought the old farmer, "calling this largelypopulated city a cemetery?"On leaving the city their way led through a cemetery where a few peoplewere praying beside a grave and distributing chupatties and kulchas toPassers-by, in the name of their beloved dead.  They beckoned to thetwo travelers and gave them as much as they would."What a splendid city this is!" said the young man."Now, the man must surely be demented!"  thought the old farmer.  "Iwonder what he will do next?  He will be calling the land water, andthe water land; and be speaking of light where there is darkness, andof darkness where it is light."  However, he kept his thoughts tohimself.Presently they had to wade through a stream that ran along the edge ofthe cemetery.  The water was rather deep, so the old farmer took offhis shoes and pajamas and crossed over; but the young man waded throughit with his shoes and pajamas on."Well!  I never did see such a perfect fool, both in word and in deed,said the old man to himself.However, he liked the fellow; and thinking that he would amuse his wifeand daughter, he invited him to come and stay at his house as long ashe had occasion to remain in the village."Thank you very much," the young man replied; "but let me firstinquire, if you please, whether the beam of your house is strong. "The old farmer left him in despair, and entered his house laughing."There is a man in yonder field," he said, after returning theirgreetings.  "He 'has come the greater part of the way with me, and Iwanted him to put up here as long as he had to stay in this village.But the fellow is such a fool that I cannot make anything out of him.He wants to know if the beam of this house is all right.  The man mustbe mad!" and saying this he burst into a fit of laughter."Father," said the farmer's daughter, who was a very sharp and wisegirl, "this man, whosoever he is, is no fool, as you deem him.  He onlywishes to know if you can afford to entertain him.""Oh! of course," replied the farmer.  "I see.  Well perhaps you canhelp me to solve some of his other mysteries.  While we were walkingtogether he asked whether he should carry me or I should carry him, ashe thought that would be a pleasanter mode of proceeding.""Most assuredly," said the girl.  "He meant that one of you should tella story to beguile the time.""Oh, yes.  Well, we were passing through a cornfield, when he asked mewhether it was eaten or not.""And didn't you know the meaning of this, father?  He simply wished toknow if the man was in debt or not; because if the owner of the fieldwas in debt, then the produce of the field was as good as eaten to him;that is, it would have to go to his creditors.""Yes, yes, yes; of course!  Then, on entering a certain village, hebade me take his clasp knife and get two horses with it, and bring backthe knife again to him.""Are not two stout sticks as good as two horses for helping one alongon the road?  He only asked you to cut a couple of sticks and becareful not to lose his knife.""I see," said time farmer.  "While we were walking over the city we didnot see anybody that we knew, and not a soul gave us a scrap ofanything to eat, till we were passing the cemetery; but there somepeople called to us and put into our hands some chupatties and kulchas;so my companion called the city a cemetery, and the cemetery a city.""This also is to be understood, father, if one thinks of the city asthe place where everything is to be obtained, and of inhospitablepeople as worse than the dead.  The city, though crowded with people,was as if dead, as far as you were concerned; while, in the cemetery,which is crowded with time dead, you were saluted by kind friends andprovided with bread.""True, true!" said the astonished farmer.  "Then, just now, when wewere crossing the stream, he waded through it without taking off hisshoes and pajamas.''"I admire his wisdom," replied time girl.  "I have often thought howstupid people were to venture into that swiftly flowing stream and overthose sharp stones with bare feet.  The slightest stumble and theywould fall, and be wetted from head to foot.  This friend of yours is amost wise man.  I should like to see him and speak to him.""Very well," said time farmer; "I will go and find him, and bring himin.""Tell him, father, that our beams are strong enough, and then he willcome in.  I'll send on ahead a present to the man, to show him that wecan afford to have him for our guest."Accordingly she called a servant and sent him to the young man with apresent of a basin of ghee, twelve chupatties, and a jar of milk, andthe following message: "O friend, time moon is full; twelve months makea year, and the sea is overflowing with water."Half-way the bearer of this present and message met his little son,who, seeing what was in the basket, begged his father to give him someof the food.  His father foolishly complied.  Presently he saw theyoung man, and gave him the rest of the present and the message."Give your mistress my salaam," he replied, "and tell her that the moonis new, and that I can only find eleven mouths in the year, and the seais by no means full."Not understanding the meaning of these words, the servant repeated themword for word, as he had heard them, to his mistress; and thus histheft was discovered, and he was severely punished.  After a littlewhile the young man appeared with the old farmer.  Great attention wasshown to him, and he was treated in every way as it he were the son ofa great man, although his humble host knew nothing of his origin.  Atlength be told them everything-about the laughing of the fish, hisfather's threatened execution, and his own banishment-and asked theiradvice as to what he should do."The laughing of the fish,'' said the girl "which seems to have beenthe cause of all this trouble, indicates that there is a man in thepalace who is plotting against the king's life.""Joy, joy!" exclaimed the vizier's son.  "There is yet time for me toreturn and save my father from an ignominious and unjust death, and theking from danger."The following day he hastened back to his own country, taking with himthe farmer's daughter.  Immediately on arrival he ran to the palace andinformed his father of what he had heard.  The poor vizier, now almostdead from the expectation of death, was at once carried to the king, towhom he repeated the news that his son had just brought."Never!" said the king."But it must be so, Your Majesty," replied the vizier; "and in order toprove the truth of what I have heard, I pray you call together all themaids in your palace, and order them to jump over a pit, which must bedug.  We'll soon find out whether there is any man there."The king had time pit dug, and commanded all the maids belonging to thepalace to try to jump it.  All of them tried, but only one succeeded.That one was found to be a man!Thus was the queen satisfied, and the faithful old vizier saved.Afterward, as soon as could be, the vizier's son married the oldfarmer's daughter; and a most happy marriage it was.THE FARMER AND THE MONEY LENDERBy Joseph JacobsTHERE was ounce a farmer who suffered much at time hands of the moneylender.  Good harvests, or bad, the farmer was always poor, the moneylender rich.  At the last, when he hadn't a farthing left, the farmerwent to the money lender's house, and said, "You can't squeeze waterfrom a stone, and as you have nothing to get by me now, you might tellme the secret of becoming rich.""My friend," returned the money lender, piously, "riches come from Ram-ask him.""Thank you, I will!" replied the simple farmer; so he prepared threegriddle cakes to last him on the journey, and set out to find Ram.First he met a Brahman, and to him he gave a cake asking him to pointout the road to Ram; but the Brahman only took the cake and went on hisway without a word.  Next the farmer met a Jogi or devotee, and to himhe gave a cake, without receiving any help in return.  At last, he cameupon a poor man sitting under a tree, and finding out he was hungry,the kindly farmer gave him his last cake, and sitting clown to restbeside him, entered into conversation."And where are you going?"  asked the poor man, at length."Oh, I have a long journey before me, for I am going to find Ram!"replied the farmer.  "I don't suppose you could tell me which way togo?""Perhaps I can," said the poor man, smiling, "for I am Ram! What do youwant of me?"Then the farmer told the whole story, and Rain, taking pity on him,gave him a conch shell, and showed him how to blow it in a particularway, saying, "Remember! whatever you wish for, you have only to blowthe conch that way, and your wish will be fulfilled.  Only have a careof that money lender, for even magic is not proof against their wiles!"The farmer went back to his village rejoicing.  In fact the moneylender noticed his high spirits at once, and said to himself, "Somegood fortune must have befallen the stupid fellow, to make him hold hishead so jauntily."  Therefore he went over to the simple farmer'shouse, and congratulated him on his good fortune, in such cunningwords, pretending to have heard all about it, that before long thefarmer found himself telling the whole story-all except the secret ofblowing the conch, for, with all his simplicity, the farmer was notquite such a fool as to tell that.Nevertheless, the money lender determined to have the conch by hook orby crook, and as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles, hewaited for a favorable opportunity and stole the conch.But, after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in everyconceivable way, he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad job.However, being determined to succeed he went back to the farmer andsaid, coolly, "Look here; I've got your conch, but I can't use it; youhaven't got it, So it's clear you can't use it either.  Business is ata standstill unless we make a bargain.  Now, I promise to give you backyour conch, and never to interfere with your using it, on onecondition, which is this-Whatever you get from it, I am to get double.""Never!" cried the farmer; "that would be the old business all overagain!""Not at all!" replied time wily money lender; "you will have yourshare!  Now, don't be a dog in the manger, for if you get all you want,what can it matter to you if I am rich or poor?"At last, though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefitto a money lender, the farmer was forced to yield, and from that time,no matter what he gained by the power of the couch, time money lendergained double.  And the knowledge that this was so preyed upon thefarmer's mind day and night, so that he had no satisfaction out ofanything.At last, there came a very dry season-so dry that the farmer's cropswithered for want of rain.  Then he blew his conch, and wished for awell to water them, and lo! there was the well, but the money lenderhad two!-two beautiful new wells!  This was too much for any farmer tostand: and our friend brooded over it, and brooded over it, till atlast a bright idea came into his head.  He seized the conch, blew itloudly, and cried out, "Oh Ram!  I wish to be blind of one eye!"  Andso he was in a twinkling, but the money lender of course was blind ofboth, and in trying to steer his way between the two new wells, he fellinto one and was drowned.Now this true story shows that a farmer once got time better of a moneylender-but only by losing one of his eyes.PRIDE GOETH BEFORE A FALLBy Joseph JacobsIN a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants who always wentabout together.  Once upon a time they had traveled far afield, andwere returning home with a great deal of money which they had obtainedby selling their wares.  Now there happened to be a dense forest neartheir village, and this they reached early one morning.  In it therelived three notorious robbers, of whose existence the traders had neverheard, and while they were still in the middle of it the robbers stoodbefore them, with swords and cudgels in their hands, and ordered themto lay down all they had.  The traders had no weapons with them, andso, though they were many more in number, they had to submit themselvesto the robbers, who took away everything from them, even the veryclothes they wore, and gave to each only a small loin cloth a span inbreadth and a cubit in length.The idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all theirproperty now took possession of the robbers' minds.  They seatedthemselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered, andordered them to dance to them before returning home.  The merchants nowmourned their fate.They had lost all they had, except their loin cloth, and still therobbers were not satisfied, but ordered them to dance.There was, among the ten merchants, one who was very clever.  Hepondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends, thedance they would have to perform, and the magnificent manner in whichthe three robbers had seated themselves on the grass.  At the same timehe observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground, inthe assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders, who were nowcommencing to dance.  So he took the lead in the dance, and, as a songis always sung by the leader on such occasions, to which the rest keeptime with hands and feet, he thus began to sing:	We are enty men,	They are erith men:	If each erith man	Surround eno men,	Eno man remains.	Ta, tai, tom, tadingana.The robbers were all uneducated, and thought that the leader was merelysinging a song as usual.  So it was in one sense: for the leadercommenced from a distance, and had sung the song over twice before heand his companions commenced to approach the robbers.  They hadunderstood his meaning, because they had been trained in trade.When two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of apurchaser, they use a riddling sort of language."What is the price of this cloth?"  one trader will ask another."Enty rupees," another will reply, meaning "ten rupees."Thus, there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meantunless he be acquainted with trade language.  By the rules of thissecret language erith means "three," enty means "ten," and eno means"one."  So the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellow-tradersthat they were ten men, the robbers only three, that if three pouncedupon each of the robbers, nine of them could hold them down, while theremaining one bound the robbers' hands and feet.The three thieves, glorying in their victory, and little understandingthe meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers, were proudlyseated chewing betel and tobacco.  Meanwhile the song was sung a thirdtime.  Ta, tai, tom had left the lips of the singer; and, beforetadingana was out of them, the traders separated into parties of three,and each party pounced upon a thief.  The remaining one-the leaderhimself-tore up into long narrow strips a large piece of cloth, sixcubits long, and tied the hands and feet of the robbers.  These wereentirely humbled now, and rolled on the ground like three bags of rice!The ten traders now took back all their property, and armed themselveswith the swords and cudgels of their enemies; and when they reachedtheir village, they often amused their friends and relatives byrelating their adventure.HOW THE WICKED SONS WERE DUPEDBy Joseph JacobsA VERY wealthy old man, imagining that he was on the point of death,sent for his sons and divided his property among them.  However, he didnot die for several years afterward, and miserable years many of themwere.  Besides the weariness of old age, the old fellow had to bearwith much abuse and cruelty from his sons.  Wretched, selfish ingrates!Previously they vied with one another in trying to please their father,hoping thus to receive more money, but now they had received theirpatrimony, they cared not how soon he left them-nay, the sooner thebetter, because he was only a needless trouble and expense.  And theylet the poor old man know what they felt.One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles.  Thefriend sympathized very much with him, and promised to think over thematter, and call in a little while and tell him what to do.  He did so;in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full ofstones and gravel before him."Look here, friend," said he.  "Your sons will get to know of my cominghere to-day, and will inquire about it.  You must pretend that I cameto discharge a long-standing debt with you, and that you are severalthousands of rupees richer than you thought you were.  Keep these bagsin your own hands, and on no account let your sons get to them as longas you are alive.  You will soon find them change their conduct towardyou.  Salaam, I will come again soon to see how you are getting on."When the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth theybegan to be more attentive and pleasing to their father than everbefore.  And thus they continued to the day of the old man's demise,when the bags were greedily opened, and found to contain only stonesand gravel!THE TIGER, THE BRAHMAN, AND THE JACKALBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time a Tiger was caught in a trap.  He tried in vain to getout through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when hefailed.By chance a poor Brahman came by."Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!" cried the Tiger."Nay, my friend," replied the Brahman mildly, you would probably eat meif I did.""Not at all!" swore the Tiger with many oaths; "on the contrary, Ishould be forever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"Now when the Tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the piousBrahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door ofthe cage.  Out popped the Tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried,"What a fool you are!  What is to prevent my eating you now, for afterbeing cooped up so long I am terribly hungry!"In vain the Brahman Pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was apromise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose toquestion as to the justice of the Tiger's action.So the Brahman first asked a Pipal Tree what it thought of the matter,but the Pipal Tree replied coldly, "What have you to complain about?Don't I give shade and shelter to everyone who passes by, and don'tthey in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle?  Don'twhimper-be a. man! "Then the Brahman sad at heart, went farther afield till he saw aBuffalo turning a well wheel; but he fared no better from it, for itanswered, "You are a fool to expect gratitude!  Look at me!  While Igave milk they fed me on cottonseed and oil cake, but now I am dry theyyoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!"The Brahman, still more sad, asked the Road to give him its opinion."My dear sir,'' said the Road, "how foolish you are to expect anythingelse!  Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, greatand small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but theashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!"On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met aJackal, who called out, "Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman?  You lookas miserable as a fish out of water!"The Brahman told him all that had occurred."How very confusing!" said the Jackal, when the recital was ended;"would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixedup?"The Brahman told it all over again, but the Jackal shook his head in adistracted sort of way, and still could not understand."It's very odd," said he, sadly, "but it all seems to go in at one earand out at the other!  I will go to the place where it all happened,and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment. "So they returned to the cage, by which the Tiger was waiting for theBrahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws."You've been away a long time!" growled the savage beast, "but now letus begin our dinner.""Our dinner!" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knockedtogether with fright; "what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!""Give mime five minutes, my lord!" he pleaded, "in order that I mayexplain matters to the Jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."The Tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again,not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible.''Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!" cried the Jackal, wringing itspaws.  "Let me see! how did it all begin?  You were in the cage, andthe Tiger came walking by-""Pooh!" interrupted the Tiger, "what a fool you are!  I was in thecage.""Of course!" cried the Jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; "yesI was in the cage-no I wasn't-dear! dear, where are my wits?  Let mesee-the Tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by-no,that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, forI shall never understand!""Yes, you shall!" returned the Tiger, in a rage at the Jackal'sstupidity; "I'll make you understand!  Look here-I am the Tiger-""Yes, my lord!""And that is the Brahman-""Yes, my lord!""And that is the cage-""Yes, my lord!""And I was in the cage-do you understand?""Yes-no- Please, my lord-""Well?"  cried the Tiger impatiently."Please, my lord !-how did you get in?""How?-why, in the usual way, of course! ""Oh, dear me!-My head is beginning to whirl again! Please don't getangry, my lord, but what is the usual way?"At this the Tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried,"This way!  Now do you understand how it was?""Perfectly!" grinned the Jackal, as he dexterously shut the door.  "Andif you will permit me to say so, I think matters will remain as theywere!"THE LAMBIKINBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about onhis little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly.Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy tothink of all the good things he should get from her, when who should hemeet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said:"Lambikin!  Lambikin!  I'll EAT YOU!"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:	"To Granny's house I go,	Where I shall fatter grow,	Then you can eat me so."The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.By and by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at thetender morsel before him, said: "Lambikin!  Lambikin!  I'll EAT YOU!"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:	"To Granny's house I go,	Where I shall fatter grow,	Then you can eat me so."The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.And by and by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, arid anEagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:"Lambikin!  Lambikin!  I'll EAT YOU!"But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:	"To Granny's house I go,	Where I shall fatter grow,	Then you can eat me so.At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry,"Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought tokeep their promises, please put me into the corn bin at once."So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn bin,and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate,and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny saidhe was fat enough for anything, and must go home.  But cunning littleLambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eathim on the way back, he was so plump and tender."I'll tell you what you must do," said Master Lambikin, "you must makea little drumikin out of the skin of' my little brother who died, andthen I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as adrum myself."So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin,with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm inthe middle, and trundled away gayly.  Soon lie met with the Eagle, whocalled out:	"Drumikin!  Drumikin!	Have you seen Lambikin?"And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:	"Fallen into the fire, and so will you	On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!""How very annoying!" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of thetender morsel he had let slip.Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:	"Tum-pa, tum-too;	Tum-pa, tum-too!"Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:	"Drumikin!  Drumikin!	Have you seen Lambikin?"And to each of them the little slyboots replied:	"Fallen into the fire, and so will you	On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum-too;	Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!"Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had letslip.At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharpas a needle, and he too called out-	"Drumikin!  Drumikin!	Have you seen Lambikin?"And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gayly:	"Fallen into the fire, and so will you	On little Drumikin!  Tum-pa-"But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognized his voice atonce, arid cried: "Hullo!  you've turned yourself inside out, have you?Just you come out of that!"Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.THE RAT'S WEDDINGBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time a fat, sleek Rat was caught in a shower of rain, andbeing far from shelter he set to work and soon dug a nice hole in theground, in which he sat as dry as a bone while the raindrops splashedoutside, making little puddles on the road.Now in the course of digging, he came upon a fine bit of root, quitedry and fit for fuel, which he set aside carefully-for the Rat is aneconomical creature--in order to take it home with him.  So when theshower was over, he set off with the dry root in his mouth.  As he wentalong, daintily picking his way through the puddles, he Saw a Poor Manvainly trying to light a fire, while a little circle of children stoodby, and cried piteously."Goodness gracious!" exclaimed the Rat, who was both soft-hearted andcurious, "What a dreadful noise to make!  What is the matter?""The children are hungry," answered the Man; "they are crying for theirbreakfast, but the sticks are damp, the fire won't burn, and so I can'tbake the cakes.""If that is all your trouble, perhaps I can help you," said the good-natured Rat, "you are welcome to this dry root and I'll warrant it willsoon make a fine blaze."The Poor Man, with a thousand thanks, took the dry root, and in histurn presented the Rat with a morsel of dough, as a reward for hiskindness and generosity."What a remarkably lucky fellow I am!" thought the Rat, as he trottedoff gayly with his prize, "and clever, too!  Fancy making a bargainlike that-food enough to last me five days in return for a rotten oldstick!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  What it is to have brains!"Going along, hugging his good fortune in this way, he came presently toa Potter's yard, where the Potter, leaving his wheel to spin round byitself, was trying to pacify his three little children, who werescreaming arid crying as if they would burst."My gracious!" cried the Rat, stopping his ears, "what a noise!  dotell me what it is all about.""I suppose they are hungry," replied the Potter ruefully; "their motherhas gone to get flour in the bazaar, for there is none in the house.In the meantime I can neither work nor rest because of them.""Is that all?" answered the officious Rat; then I can help you.  Takethis dough, cook it quickly, and stop their mouths with food."The Potter overwhelmed the Rat with thanks for his obliging kindness,and choosing out a nice well-burned pipkin, insisted on his acceptingit as a remembrance.The Rat was delighted at the exchange, and though the pipkin was just atrifle awkward for him to manage, he succeeded, after infinite trouble,in balancing it on his head and went away gingerly, tink-a-tink, tin k-a-tink, down the road, with his tail over his arm for fear he shouldtrip on it.  And all the time he kept saying to himself, "What a luckyfellow I am!  and clever, too!  Such a hand at a bargain!"By and by he came to where some cowherds were herding their cattle.One of them was milking a buffalo, and having no pail, he used hisshoes instead."Oh fie!  oh fie!" cried the cleanly Rat, quite shocked at the sight."What a nasty, dirty trick!  Why don't you use a pail?""For the best of all reasons-we haven't got one!" growled the Cowherd,who did not see why the Rat should put his finger in the pie."If that is all," replied the dainty Rat, "oblige me by using thispipkin, for I cannot bear dirt!"The Cowherd, nothing loath, took the pipkin and milked away until itwas brimming over; then turning to the Rat, who stood looking on, said,"Here, little fellow, You may have a drink, in payment."But if the Rat was good-natured he was also shrewd.  "No, no, myfriend," said he, "that will not do!  As if I could drink the worth ofany pipkin at a draft!  My dear sir, I couldn't hold it!  Besides, Inever make a bad bargain, so I expect you, at least to give me thebuffalo that gave the milk.""Nonsense!" cried the Cowherd; "a buffalo for a pipkin!  Whoever heardof such a price?  And what on earth could you do with a buffalo whenyou got it?  Why, the pipkin was about as much as you could manage."At this the Rat drew himself up with dignity, for he did not likeallusions to his size.  "That is my affair, not yours," he retorted;"your business is to hand over the buffalo."So just for the fun of the thing, and to amuse themselves at the Rat'sexpense, the cowherds loosened the buffalo's halter and began to tie itto the little animal's tail."No!  no!' he called, in a great hurry.  "If the beast pulled, the skinof my tail would come off, and then where should I be?  Tie it aroundmy neck, if you please."So with much laughter the cowherds tied the halter round the Rat'sneck, and he, after a polite leave-taking, set off gayly toward homewith his prize; that is to say, he set off with the rope, for no soonerdid he come to the end of the tether than be was brought up with around turn; the buffalo, nose down, grazing away, would not budge untilit had finished its tuft of grass, and then seeing another in adifferent direction marched off toward it, while the Rat, to avoidbeing dragged, had to trot humbly behind, willy-nilly.  He was tooproud to confess the truth, of course, and, nodding his head knowinglyto the cowherds, said: "Ta-ta, good people!  I am going home this way.It may be a little longer, but it's much shadier."And when the cowherds roared with laughter he took no notice, buttrotted on, looking as dignified as possible.  "After all," he reasonedto himself, "when one keeps a buffalo one has to look after itsgrazing.  A beast must get a good bellyful of grass if it is to giveany milk, and I have plenty of time at my disposal."  So all day longhe trotted about after the buffalo, making believe; but by evening hewas dead tired, and felt truly thankful when the great big beast,having eaten enough, lay down under a tree to chew the cud.Just then a bridal party came by.  The Bridegroom and his friends hadevidently gone on to the next village, leaving the Bride's palanquin tofollow; so the palanquin bearers, being lazy fellows and seeing a niceshady tree, put down their burden, and began to cook some food."What detestable meanness!" grumbled one; "a grand wedding, and nothingbut plain rice to eat!  Not a scrap of meat in it, neither sweet norsalt!  It would serve the skinflints right if we upset the Bride into aditch!""Dear me!" cried the Rat at once, seeing a way out of his difficulty,"that is a shame!  I sympathize with your feelings so entirely that ifyou will allow me, I'll give you my buffalo.  You can kill it, and cookit.""Your buffalo!" returned the discontented bearers.  "What rubbish!Whoever heard of a rat owning a buffalo?""Not often, I admit," replied the Rat with conscious pride; "but lookfor yourselves.  Can you not see that I am leading the beast by astring?""Oh, never mind the string!" cried a great big hungry bearer; master orno master, I mean to have meat for my dinner!"  Whereupon they killedthe buffalo, and cooking its flesh, ate their dinner with a relish;then, offering the remains to the Rat, said carelessly, "Here, littleRat-skin, that is for you!""Now look here!" cried the Rat hotly; "I'll have none of your pottage,or your sauce, either.  You don't suppose I am going to give my bestbuffalo, that gave quarts and quarts of milk-the buffalo I have beenfeeding all day-for a wee bit of rice?  No!  I got a loaf for a bit ofstick; I got a pipkin for a little loaf; I got a buffalo for a pipkin;and now I'll have the Bride for my buffalo-the Bride, and nothingelse!"By this time the servants, having satisfied their hunger, began toreflect on what they had done, and becoming alarmed at theconsequences, arrived at the conclusion it would be wisest to maketheir escape while they could.  So, leaving the Bride in her palanquin,they took to their heels in various directions.The Rat, being as it were left in possession, advanced to thepalanquin, and drawing aside the curtain, with the sweetest of voicesand best of bows begged the Bride to descend.  She hardly knew whetherto laugh or to cry, but as any company, even a Rat's, was better thanbeing quite alone in the wilderness, she did what she was bidden, andfollowed the lead of her guide, who set off as fast as be could for hishole.As he trotted along beside the lovely young Bride, who, by her richdress and glittering jewels, seemed to be some king's daughter, he keptsaying to himself, "How clever I am!  What bargains I do make, to besure!"When they arrived at his hole, the Rat stepped forward with thegreatest politeness, and said, "Welcome, madam, to my humble abode!Pray step in, or if you will allow me, and as the passage is somewhatdark, I will show you the way."Whereupon he ran in first, but after a time, finding the Bride did notfollow, he put his nose out again, saying testily, "Well, madam, whydon't you follow?  Don't you know it's rude to keep your husbandwaiting?""My good sir," laughed the handsome young Bride, "I can't squeeze intothat little hole!"The Rat coughed; then after a moment's thought he replied, "There issome truth in your remark- you are overgrown, and I suppose I shallhave to build you a thatch somewhere, For to-night you can rest underthat wild plum tree.""But I am so hungry!" said the Bride ruefully."Dear, dear!  everybody seems hungry to-day!" returned the Ratpettishly; "however, that's easily settled-I'll fetch you Some supperin a trice."So he ran into his hole, returning immediately with an ear of milletand a dry pea.  "There!" said he, triumphantly, "isn't that a finemeal?""I can't eat that!" whimpered the Bride; "it isn't a mouthful; and Iwant rice pottage, and cakes, and sweet eggs, and sugar drops.  I shalldie if I don't get them!""Oh, dear me!" cried the Rat in a rage, "what a nuisance a bride is, tobe sure!  Why don't you eat the wild plums?""I can't live on wild plums!" retorted the weeping Bride; "nobodycould; besides, they are only half ripe, and I can't reach them.""Rubbish!" cried the Rat; "ripe or unripe, they must do you for to-night, and to-morrow you can gather a basketful, sell them in the city,and buy sugar drops and sweet eggs to your heart's content!"So the next morning the Rat climbed up into the plum tree, and nibbledaway at the stalks till the fruit fell down into the Bride's veil.Then, unripe as they were, she carried them into the city, calling outthrough the streets-	"Green plums I sell!  green plums I sell!	Princess am I, Rat's bride as well!"As she passed by the palace, her mother, the Queen, heard her voice,and running out, recognized her daughter.  Great were the rejoicings,for everyone thought the poor Bride had been eaten by wild beasts.In the midst of the feasting and merriment, the Rat, who had followedthe Princess at a distance, and had become alarmed at her long absence,arrived at the door, against which he beat with a big knobby stick,calling out fiercely, "Give me my wife!  Give me my wife!  She is mineby a fair bargain.  I gave a stick and I got a loaf; I gave a loaf andI got a pipkin; I gave a pipkin and I got a buffalo; I gave a buffaloand I got a bride.  Give me my wife!  Give me my wife!""La!  son-in-law!  What a fuss you do make," said the wily old Queenthrough the door, "and all about nothing!  Who wants to run away withyour wife?  On the contrary, we are proud to see you, and I only keepyou waiting at the door till we can spread the carpets, and receive youin style."Hearing this, the Rat was mollified, and waited patiently outside whilethe cunning old Queen prepared for his reception, which she did bycutting a hole in the very middle of a stool, putting a red hot stoneunderneath, covering it over with a stew-pan lid, and then spreading abeautiful embroidered cloth over all.  Then she went to the door, andreceiving the Rat with the greatest respect, led him to the stool,praying him to be seated."Dear!  dear!  how clever I am!  What bargains I do make, to be sure!"said he to himself as he climbed on to the stool.  "Here I am, son-in-law to a real live Queen!  What will the neighbors say?"At first he sat down on the edge of the stool, but even there it waswarm, and after a while he began to fidget, saying, "Dear me, mother-in-law, how hot your house is!  Everything I touch seems burning!""You are out of the wind there, my son," replied the cunning old Queen;"sit more in the middle of the stool, and then you will feel the breezeand get cooler."But he didn't!  for the stewpan lid by this time had become so hot thatthe Rat fairly frizzled when he sat down on it; and it was not until hehad left all his tail, half his hair, and a large piece of his skinbehind him, that he managed to escape, howling with pain, and vowingthat never, never, never again would he make a bargain!THE JACKAL AND THE PARTRIDGEBy Flora Annie SteelA JACKAL and a partridge swore eternal friendship; but the Jackal wasvery exacting and jealous.  "You don't do half as much for me as I dofor you," he used to say, "and yet you talk a great deal of yourfriendship.  Now my idea of a friend is one who is able to make melaugh or cry, give me a good meal, or save my life if need be.  Youcouldn't do that!""Let us see," answered the Partridge; "follow me at a little distance,and if I don't make you laugh soon you may eat me!"So she flew on till she met two travelers trudging along, one behindthe other.  They were both foot-sore and weary, and the first carriedhis bundle on a stick over his shoulder, while the second had his shoesin his hand.Lightly as a feather the Partridge settled on the first traveler'sstick.  He, none the wiser, trudged on, but the second traveler, seeingthe bird sitting so tamely just in front of his nose, said to himself,"What a chance for a supper!" and immediately flung his shoes at it,they being ready to hand.  Whereupon the Partridge flew away, and theshoes knocked off the first traveler's turban."What a plague do you mean?" cried he, angrily turning on hiscompanion.  "Why did you throw your shoes at my head?""Brother," replied the other mildly, "do not be vexed.  I didn't throwthem at you, but at a Partridge that was sitting on your stick.""On my stick!  Do you take me for a fool?" shouted the injured man, ina great rage.  "Don't tell me such cock-and-bull stories.  First youinsult me, and then you lie like a coward; but I'll teach you manners!"Then he fell upon his fellow traveler without more ado, and they foughtuntil they could not see out of their eyes, till their noses werebleeding, their clothes in rags, and the Jackal had nearly died oflaughing."Are you satisfied?" asked the Partridge of her friend."Well," answered the Jackal, "you have certainly made nine laugh, but Idoubt if you could make me cry.  It is easy enough to be a buffoon; itis more difficult to excite the highest emotions.""Let us see," retorted the Partridge, somewhat piqued; "there is ahuntsman with his dogs coming along the road.  Just creep into thathollow tree and watch me; if you don't weep scalding tears, you musthave no feeling in you!"The Jackal did as he was bid, and watched the Partridge, who beganfluttering about the bushes till the dogs caught sight of her, when sheflew to the hollow tree where the Jackal was hidden.  Of course thedogs smelt him at once, and set up such a yelping and scratching thatthe huntsman came up, and seeing what it was, dragged the Jackal out bythe tail.  Whereupon the dogs worried him to their heart's content, andfinally left him for dead.By and by he opened his eyes-for he was only foxing-and saw thePartridge sitting on a branch above him."Did you cry?" she asked anxiously.  "Did I rouse your high emo---""Be quiet, will you!" snarled the Jackal; half dead with fear!"So there the Jackal lay for some time, getting the better of hisbruises, and meanwhile he became hungry."Now is the time for friendship!" said he to the Partridge.  "Get me agood dinner, and I will acknowledge you a true friend.""Very well!" replied the Partridge; "only watch me, and help yourselfwhen the time comes."Just then a troop of women came by, carrying their husbands dinners tothe harvest field.  The Partridge gave a little plaintive cry, andbegan fluttering along from bush to bush as if she were wounded."A wounded bird!  a wounded bird!" cried the women; "we can easilycatch it."  Whereupon they set off in pursuit, but the cunningPartridge played a thousand tricks, till they became so excited overthe chase that they put their bundles on the ground in order to pursueit more nimbly.  The Jackal, meanwhile, seizing his opportunity, creptup, and made off with a good dinner."Are you satisfied now?" asked the Partridge."Well," returned the Jackal, "I confess you have given me a very gooddinner; you have also made me laugh-and cry-ahem!  But, after all, thegreat test of friendship is beyond you-you couldn't save my life!""Perhaps not," acquiesced the Partridge mournfully, "I am so small andweak.  But it grows late-we should be getting home; and as it is a longway round by the ford, let us go across the river.  My friend theCrocodile will carry us over."Accordingly they set off for the river, and the Crocodile kindlyconsented to carry them across, so they sat on his broad back and heferried them over.  But just as they were in the middle of the streamthe Partridge remarked.  "I believe the Crocodile intends to play us atrick.  How awkward if he were to drop you into the water!""Awkward for you, too!" replied the Jackal, turning pale."Not at all!  not at all!  I have wings, you haven't."On this the Jackal shivered and shook with fear, and when theCrocodile, in a gruesome growl, remarked that he was hungry and wanteda good meal, the wretched creature hadn't a word to say."Pooh!" cried the Partridge airily, "don't try tricks on us-I shouldfly away, and as for my friend, the Jackal, you couldn't hurt him.  Heis not such a fool as to take his life with him on these littleexcursions; he leaves it at home, locked up in the cupboard.""Is that a fact?" asked the Crocodile, surprised. "Certainly!" retortedthe Partridge.  Try to eat him if you like, but you will only tireyourself to no purpose."Dear me!  how very odd!" gasped time Crocodile; and he was so takenaback that he carried the Jackal safe to shore."Well, are you satisfied now?" asked the Partridge."My dear madam!" quoth the Jackal, "you have made me laugh, you havemade me cry, you have given me a good dinner, and you have saved mylife; but, upon my honor, I think you are too clever for a friend sogood-by!"And the Jackal never went near the Partridge again.THE JACKAL AND THE CROCODILEBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time Mr. Jackal was trotting along gayly, when lie caughtsight of a wild plum tree laden with fruit on the other side of abroad, deep stream.  I could not get across anyhow, so he just sat downon the bank and looked at the ripe, luscious fruit until his mouthwatered with desire.Now it so happened that, just then, Miss Crocodile came floating downstream with her nose in the air."Good morning, my dear!" said Mr. Jackal politely; "how beautiful youlook to-day, and how charmingly you swim!  Now, if I could only swimtoo, what a fine feast of plums we two friends might have over theretogether!"  And Mr. Jackal laid his paw on his heart, and sighed.Now Miss Crocodile had a very inflammable heart, and when Mr. Jackallooked at her so admiringly, and spoke so sentimentally, she simperedand blushed, saying, "Oh!  Mr. Jackal!  how can you talk so?  I couldnever dream of going out to dinner with you, unless-unless-""Unless what?" asked the Jackal persuasively."Unless we were going to be married!" simpered Miss Crocodile."And why shouldn't we be married, my charmer?" returned the Jackaleagerly.  "I would go and fetch the barber to begin the betrothal atonce, but I am so faint with hunger just at present that I should neverreach the village.  Now, if the most adorable of her sex would onlytake pity on her slave, and carry me over the stream, I might refreshmyself with those plums, and so gain strength to accomplish the ardentdesire of my heart!"Here the Jackal sighed so piteously, and cast such sheep's eyes at MissCrocodile, that she was unable to withstand him.  So she carried himacross to the plum tree, and then sat on the water's edge to think overher wedding dress, while Mr. Jackal feasted on the plums and enjoyedhimself."Now for the barber, my beauty!" cried the gay Jackal, when he hadeaten as much as he could.  Then the blushing Miss Crocodile carriedhim back again, and bade him be quick about his business, like a deargood creature, for really she felt so flustered at the very idea thatshe didn't know what might happen."Now don't distress yourself, my dear!" quoth the deceitful Mr. Jackal,springing to the bank, "because it's not impossible that I may not findthe barber, and then, you know, you may have to wait some time, aconsiderable time in fact, before I return.  So don't injure yourhealth for my sake, if you please."  With that he blew her a kiss, andtrotted away with his tail up.Of course he never came back, though trusting Miss Crocodile waitedpatiently for him; at last she understood what a gay, deceitful fellowhe was, and determined to have her revenge on him one way or another.So she hid herself in the water, under the roots of a tree, close to aford where the Jackal always came to drink.  By and by,  sure enough,he came lilting along in a self-satisfied way, and went right into thewater for a good long draft.  Whereupon Miss Crocodile seized him bythe right legs and held on.  He guessed at once what had happened, andcalled out, "Oh!  my heart's adored!  I'm drowning!  I'm drowning!  Ifyou love me, leave hold of that old root and get a good grip of my leg-it is just next door!"Hearing this, Miss Crocodile thought she must have made a mistake, and,letting go the Jackal's leg in a hurry, seized an old root close by,and held on.  Whereupon Mr. Jackal jumped nimbly to shore, and ran offwith his tail up, calling out, "Have a little patience, my beauty!  Thebarber will come some day!"But this time Miss Crocodile knew better than to wait, and being nowdreadfully angry, she crawled away to the Jackal's hole, and, slippinginside, lay quiet.By and by Mr. Jackal came lilting along with his tail up.  "Ho!  ho!That is your game, is it?" said he to himself, when he saw the trail ofthe Crocodile in the sandy soil.  So he stood outside, and said aloud,"Bless my stars!  What has happened?  I don't half like to go in, forwhenever I come home my wife always calls out,	'Oh, dearest hubby hub!	What have you brought for grub	to me and the darling cub?'and to-day she doesn't say anything!"Hearing this, Miss Crocodile sang out from inside,	"Oh, dearest hubby hub!	What have you brought for grub	To me and the darling cub?"The Jackal winked a very big wink, and, stealing in softly, stood atthe doorway.  Meanwhile Miss Crocodile, hearing him coming, held herbreath, and lay, shamming dead, like a big log."Bless my stars!" cried Mr. Jackal, taking out his pocket handkerchief,"how very sad!  Here's poor Miss Crocodile stone dead, and all for loveof me!  Dear!  dear!  Yet it is very odd, and I don't think she can bequite dead, you know-for dead folks always wag their tails!"On this, Miss Crocodile began to wag her tail very gently, and Mr.Jackal ran off, roaring with laughter, and saying.  "Oho!  oho!  sodead folks always wag their tails!"THE JACKAL AND THE IGUANABy Flora Annie SteelONE moonlight night a miserable, half-starved Jackal, skulking throughthe village, found a worn-out pair of shoes in the gutter.  They weretoo tough for him to eat, so, determined to make some use of them, hestrung them to his ears like earrings, and, going down to the edge ofthe pond, gathered all the old bones he could find together and built aplatform of them, plastering it over with mud.On this he sat in a dignified attitude, and when any animal came to thepond to drink, he cried out in a loud voice, "Hi!  stop!  You must nottaste a drop till you have done homage to me.  So repeat these verseswhich I have composed in honor of the occasion:	'Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!'"Now, as most of the animals were very thirsty, and in a great hurry todrink, they did not care to dispute the matter, but gabbled off thewords without a second thought.  Even the royal tiger, treating it as ajest, repeated the Jackal's rime, in consequence of which the latterbecame quite a cock-a-hoop, and really began to believe he was apersonage of great importance.By and by an Iguana, or big lizard, came waddling down to the water,looking for all the world like a baby alligator."Hi!  you there!" sang out the Jackal; "you mustn't drink until youhave said-	'Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!'""Pouf!  pouf!  pouf!" gasped the Iguana.  "Mercy on us, how dry mythroat is!  Mightn't I have just a wee sip of water first?  and then Icould do justice to your admirable lines; at present I am as hoarse asa crow!""By all means," replied the Jackal, with a gratified smirk.  "I flattermyself the verses are good, especially when well recited."So the Iguana, nose down in the water, drank away until the Jackalbegan to think he would never leave off, and was quite taken aback whenhe finally came to an end of his draft, and began to move away."Hi!  hi!" cried the Jackal, recovering his presence of mind, "stop abit, and say---	'Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!'""Dear me!" replied the Iguana, politely, "I was very near forgetting!Let me see-I must try my Voice first-do, re, me, fa, sol, la, si-thatis right!  Now, how does it run?"	"Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!"repeated the Jackal, not observing that the Lizard Was carefully edgingfarther and farther away."Exactly so," returned the Iguana; "I think I could say that!"Whereupon he sang out at the top of his voice-	"Bones made up his dais, with mud it's plastered o'er,	Old shoes are his eardrops; a jackal, nothing more!"And turning round, he bolted for his hole as hard as he could.The Jackal could scarcely believe his ears, and sat dumb withastonishment.  Then, rage lending him wings, he flew after the Lizard,who, despite his short legs and scanty breath, put his best footforemost, and scuttled away at a great rate.It was a near race, however, for just as he popped into his hole, theJackal caught him by the tail, and held on.  Then it was a case of"pull, butcher; pull, baker," until the Lizard made certain his tailmust come off, and he felt as if his front teeth would come out.  Stillnot an inch did either budge, one way or the other, and there theymight have remained till the present day, had not the Iguana calledout, in his sweetest tones, "Friend, I give in!  Just leave hold of mytail, will you?  then I can turn round and come out."Whereupon the Jackal let go, and the tail disappeared up the hole in atwinkling; while all the reward the Jackal got for digging away untilhis nails were nearly worn out was hearing the Iguana sing softly-	"Bones made up his dais, with mud it's plastered o'er,	Old shoes are his eardrops; a jackal, nothing moreTHE BEAR'S BAD BARGAINBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time a very old Woodman lived with his very old Wife in atiny hut close to the orchard of a very rich man, so close that theboughs of a pear tree hung right over the cottage yard.  Now it wasagreed between the rich man and the Woodman that if any of the fruitfell into the yard, the old couple were to be allowed to eat it; so youmay imagine with what hungry eyes they watched the pears ripening, andprayed for a storm of wind, or a flock of flying foxes, or anythingwhich would cause the fruit to fall.  But nothing came, and the oldWife, who was a grumbling, scolding old thing, declared they wouldinfallibly become beggars.  So she took to giving her husband nothingbut dry bread to eat, and insisted on his working harder than ever,till the poor soul got quite thin; and all because the pears would notfall down!At last the Woodman turned round and declared he would not work moreunless his Wife gave him Khichri for his dinner; so with a very badgrace the old woman took some rice and pulse, some butter and spices,and began to cook a savory Khichri.  What an appetizing smell it had,to be sure!  The Woodman was for gobbling it up as soon as ever it wasready.  "No, no," cried the greedy old Wife, not till you have broughtme in another load of Wood; and mind it is a good one.  You must workfor your dinner."So the old man set off to the forest and began to hack and to hew withsuch a will that he soon had quite a large bundle, and with everyfaggot he cut he seemed to smell the savory Khichri and think of thefeast that was coming.Just then a Bear came swinging by, with its great black nose tilted inthe air, and its little keen eyes peering about; for bears, though goodenough fellows on the whole, are just dreadfully inquisitive."Peace be with you, friend," said the Bear, "and what may you be goingto do with that remarkably large bundle of wood?""It is for my Wife," returned the Woodman.  "The fact is," he addedconfidentially, smacking his lips, "she has made such a Khichri fordinner!  and if I bring in a good bundle of wood she is pretty sure togive me a plentiful portion.  Oh, my dear fellow, you should just smellthat Khichri."At this the Bear's mouth began to water, for, like all bears, he was adreadful glutton."Do you think your Wife would give mite some, too, if I brought her abundle of wood?" he asked anxiously."Perhaps; if it is a very big load," answered the Woodman craftily."Would-would four hundredweight be enough?" asked the Bear."I'm afraid not," returned the 'Woodman, shaking his head; "you seeKhichri is an expensive dish to make-there is rice in it, and plenty ofbutter, and pulse, and-""Would-would eight hundredweight do?""Say half a ton, and it's a bargain!" quoth the Woodman."Half a ton is a large quantity!" sighed the Bear."There is saffron in the Khichri," remarked the Woodman, casually.The Bear licked his lips, and his little eyes twinkled with greed anddelight."Well it's a bargain!  Go home sharp and tell your Wife to keep theKhichri hot; I'll be with you in a trice."Away went the Woodman in great glee to tell his Wife how the Bear hadagreed to bring half a ton of wood in return for a share of theKhichri.Now the wife could not help allowing that her husband had made a goodbargain, but being by nature a grumbler, she was determined not to bepleased, so she began to scold the old man for not having settledexactly the share the Bear was to have.  "For," said she, "he willgobble up the potful before we have finished our first helping."On this the Woodman became quite pale.  "In that case," he said, "wehad better begin now, and have a fair start." So without more ado theysquatted down on the floor, with the brass pot full of Khichri betweenthem, and began to eat as fast as they could."Remember to leave some for the Bear, Wife," said the Woodman, speakingwith his mouth crammed full."Certainly, certainly," she replied, helping herself to anotherhandful."My dear," cried the old woman in her turn, with her mouth so full shecould hardly speak, "remember the poor Bear!""Certainly, certainly, my love!" returned the old man, taking anothermouthful.So it went on, till there was not a single grain left in the pot."What's to be done now?" said the Woodman; "it is all your fault, Wife,for eating so much.""My fault!" retorted his Wife scornfully, "why, you ate twice as muchas I did!""No, I didn't!""Yes, you did! Men always eat more than women."No, they don't!""Yes, they do!""Well, it's no use quarreling about it now," said the Woodman, "theKhichri's gone, and the Bear will be furious.""That wouldn't matter much if we could get the wood," said the greedyold woman.  "I'll tell you what we must do-we must lock up everythingthere is to eat in the house, leave the Khichri pot by the fire, andhide in the garret.  When the Bear comes he will think we have gone outand left his dinner for him.  Then he will throw down his bundle andcome in.  Of course he will rampage a little when he finds the pot isempty, but he can't do much mischief, and I don't think he will takethe trouble of carrying the wood away."So they made haste to lock up all the food and hide themselves in thegarret.Meanwhile the Bear had been toiling and moiling away at his bundle ofwood, which took him much longer to collect than he expected; however,at last he arrived quite exhausted at the woodcutter's cottage.  Seeingthe brass Khichri pot by the fire, he threw down his load and went in.And then-mercy!  wasn't he angry when he found nothing in it-not even agrain of rice, nor a tiny wee bit of pulse, but only a smell that wasso uncommonly nice that he actually cried with rage and disappointment.He flew into the most dreadful temper, but though he turned the housetopsy-turvy, he could not find a morsel of food.  Finally, he declaredhe would take the wood away again, but, as the crafty old woman hadimagined, when he came to the task, he did not care, even for the sakeof revenge, to carry so heavy a burden."I won't go away empty-handed," said he to himself, seizing the Khichripot; "if I can't get the taste I'll have the smell!"Now, as he left the cottage, he caught sight of the beautiful goldenpears hanging over into the yard.  His mouth began to water at once,for he was desperately hungry, and the pears were the best of theseason.  In a trice he was on the wall, up the tree, and gathering thebiggest and ripest one he could find, was just putting it into hismouth when a thought struck him."If I take these pears home I shall be able to sell them for ever somuch to the other bears, and then with the money I shall be able to buysome Khichri.  Ha, ha!  I shall have the best of the bargain afterall!"So saying, he began to gather the ripe pears as fast as he could andput them in the Khichri pot, but whenever he came to an unripe one hewould shake his head and say, "No one would buy that, yet it is a pityto waste it."  So he would pop it into his mouth and eat it, making wryfaces if it was very sour.Now all this time the Woodman's Wife had been watching the Bear througha crevice, and holding her breath for fear of discovery; but, at last,what with being asthmatic, and having a cold in her head, she couldhold it no longer, and just as the Khichri pot was quite full of goldenripe pears, out she came with the most tremendous sneeze you everheard-"A-h-che-u !"The Bear, thinking some one had fired a gun at him, dropped the Khichripot into the cottage yard, and fled into the forest as fast as his legswould carry him.So the Woodrnan and his Wife got the Khichri, the wood, and the covetedpears, but the poor bear got nothing but a very bad stomachache fromeating unripe fruit.THE THIEF AND THE FOXBy Ramaswarni RajuA MAN tied his horse to a tree and went into an inn.  A Thief hid thehorse in a wood, and stood near the tree as if he had not done it."Did you see my horse?" said the man."Yes," said the Thief, "I saw the tree eat up your horse.''"How could the tree eat up my horse?" said the man."Why it did so," said the Thief.The two went to a Fox and told him of the case.  The Fox said.  "I amdull.  All last night the sea was on fire; I had to throw a great dealof hay into it to quench the flames; so come to-morrow, and I shallhear your case."Oh, you lie," said the Thief. "How could the sea burn?  How could hayquench the flames?""Oh, you lie," said the Fox, with a loud laugh; "how could a tree eatup a horse?"The Thief saw his lie had no legs, and gave the man his horse.THE FARMER AND THE FOXBy Ramaswami RajuA FARMER was returning from a fair which he had attended the previousday at a neighboring market town.  He had a quantity of poultry whichhe had purchased.  A Fox observed this, and approaching the Farmer,said, "Good morning, my friend.""What cheer, old fellow?" said the Farmer."I am just coming from the wood, through which you mean to go with yourpoultry.  A band of highwaymen has been tarrying there since daybreak.""Then what shall I do?" said the Farmer."Why," said the Fox, "if I were you I should stay here a while, andafter breakfast enter the wood, for by that time the robbers will haveleft the place.""So be it," said the Farmer, and had a hearty breakfast, with Reynardfor his guest.They kept drinking for a long time.  Reynard appeared to have lost hiswits; he stood up and played the drunkard to perfection.  The Farmer,who highly admired the pranks of his guest, roared with laughter, andgradually fell into a deep slumber.  It was some time after noon whenhe awoke.  To his dismay he found that the Fox was gone, and that thepoultry had all disappeared!"Alas!" said the Farmer, as he trudged on his way home with a heavyheart, "I thought the old rogue was quite drowned in liquor, but I nowsee it was all a pretense.  One must indeed be very sober to play thedrunkard to perfection."THE FOOLS AND THE DRUMBy Ramaswami RajuTWO FOOLS heard a Drum sounding, and said to themselves, There is someone inside it who makes the noise."So, watching a moment, when the drummer was out, they pierced a hole ineach side of it, and pushed their hands in.  Each felt the hand of theother within the Drum, and exclaimed, "I have caught him!"Then one said to the other, "Brother, the fellow seems to be a stubbornknave; come what will, we should not give in.""Not an inch, brother," said the other.So they kept pulling each other's hand, fancying it was the man in theDrum.  The drummer came up, and finding them in such an awkward plightshowed them with his fist who the man in the Drum really was.  But ashis fine Drum was ruined, he said, with a sigh, "Alas!  Fools havefancies with a triple wing!"THE LION AND THE GOATBy Ramaswami RajuA LION was eating up one after another the animals of a certaincountry.  One day an old Goat said, "We must put a stop to this.  Ihave a plan by which he may be sent away from this part of thecountry.""Pray act up to it at once," said the other animals.The old Goat laid himself down in a cave on the roadside, with hisflowing beard and long curved horns.  The Lion, on his way to thevillage, saw him, and stopped at the mouth of the cave."So you have come, after all," said the Goat."What do you mean?" said the Lion."Why, I have long been lying in this cave.  I have eaten up one hundredelephants, a hundred tigers, a thousand wolves, and ninety-nine lions.One more lion has been wanting.  I have waited long and patiently.Heaven has, after all, been kind to me," said the Goat, and shook hishorns and his beard, and made a start as if he were about to springupon the Lion.The latter said to himself, "This animal looks like a Goat, but it doesnot talk like one.  So it is very likely some wicked spirit in thisshape.  Prudence often serves us better than valor, so for the presentI shall return to the wood," and he turned back.The Goat rose up, and, advancing to the mouth of the cave, said, "Willyou come back tomorrow?""Never again," said the Lion."Do you think I shall be able to see you, at least, in the wood to-morrow?""Neither in the wood nor in this neighborhood any more," said the Lion,and running to the forest, soon left it with his kindred.The animals in the country, not hearing him roar any more, gatheredround the Goat, and said, "The wisdom of one doth save a host."THE GLOWWORM AND THE JAC KDAWBy Ramaswami RajuJACKDAW once ran up to a Glowworm and was about to seize him.  "Wait amoment, good friend," said the Worm, "and you shall hear something toyour advantage.""Ah!  what is it?" said the Daw."I am but one of the many glowworms that live in this forest.  If youwish to have them all, follow me," said the Glowworm."Certainly!" said the Daw.Then the Glowworm led him to a place in the wood where a fire had beenkindled by some woodmen, and pointing to the sparks flying about, said,"There you find the glowworms warming themselves round a fire.  Whenyou have done with them I shall show you some more, at a distance fromthis place."The Daw darted at the sparks and tried to swallow some of them, but hismouth being burned by the attempt, he ran away exclaiming, "Ah, theGlowworm is a dangerous little creature!"THE CAMEL AND THE PIGBy Ramaswami RajuA CAMEL said, "Nothing like being tall!  Look how tall I am!"A Pig, who heard these words, said, "Nothing like being short!  Lookhow short I am!"The Camel said, "Well, if I fail to prove the truth of what I said.  Ishall give up my hump."The Pig said, "If I fail to prove the truth of what I have said, Ishall give up my snout.""Agreed!" said the Camel."Just so!" said the Pig.They came to a garden, inclosed by a low wall without any opening.  TheCamel stood on this side of the wall, and reaching the plants within bymeans of his long neck, made a breakfast on them.  Then he turned,jeeringly to the Pig, who had been standing at the bottom of the wall,without even having a look at the good things in the garden, and said,"Now, would you be tall or short?"Next they came to a garden, inclosed by a high wall, with a wicket gateat one end.  The Pig entered by the gate, and, after having eaten hisfill of the vegetables within, came out, laughing at the poor Camel,who had had to stay outside because he was too tall to enter the gardenby the gate, and said, "Now, would you be tall or short?"Then they thought the matter over and came to the conclusion that theCamel should keep his hump and the Pig his snout, observing, "Tall isgood, where tall would do; of short, again, 'tis also true!"THE DOG AND.  THE DOG DEALERBy Ramaswami RajuA DOG was standing by the cottage of a peasant.  A man who dealt indogs passed by the way.  The Dog said, "Will you buy me?"The man said, "Oh, you ugly little thing!  I would not give a quarterof a penny for you!"Then the Dog went to the palace of the king and stood by the portal.The sentinel caressed it, and said, "You are a charming littlecreature!"Just then the Dog Dealer came by.  The Dog said, "Will you buy me?""Oh," said the man, "you guard the palace of the king, who must havepaid a high price for you.  I cannot afford to pay the amount, else Iwould willingly take you.""Ah!" said the Dog, "how place and position affect people!"THE TIGER, THE FOX, AND THE HUNTERSBy Ramaswami RajuA FOX was once caught in a trap.  A hungry Tiger saw him and said, "Soyou are here!""Only on your account," said the Fox in a whisper."How so?" said the Tiger."Why, you were complaining you could not get men to eat, so I got intothis net to-day, that you may have the men when they come to take me,"said the Fox, and gave a hint that if he would wait a while in athicket close by he would point out the men to him."May I depend upon your word?" said the Tiger."Certainly," said the Fox.The Hunters came, and seeing the Fox in the net, said, "So you arehere!""Only on your account," said the Fox, in a whisper."How so?" said the men."Why, you were complaining you could not get at the Tiger that has beendevouring your cattle; I got into this net to-day that you may havehim.  As I expected, he came to eat me up, and is in yonder thicket, "said the Fox, and gave a hint that if they would take him out of thetrap he would point out the Tiger."May we depend upon your word?" said the men."Certainly," said the Fox, while the men went with him in a circle tosee that he did not escape.Then the Fox said to the Tiger and the men, "Sir Tiger, here are themen; gentlemen, here is the Tiger."The men left the Fox and turned to the Tiger.  The former beat a hastyretreat to the wood, saying, "I have kept my promise to both; now youmay settle it between yourselves."The Tiger exclaimed, when it was too late, "Alas!  what art for adouble part!"THE SEA, THE FOX, AND THE WOLFBy Ramaswami RajuA FOX that lived by the seashore once met a 'Wolf that had never seenthe Sea.  The Wolf said, "What is the Sea?""It is a great piece of water by my dwelling," said the Fox."Is it under your control?" said the Wolf."Certainly," said the Fox."Will you show me the Sea, then?" said the Wolf."With pleasure," said the Fox.  So the Fox led the Wolf to the Sea andsaid to the waves, "Now go back"-they went back!  "Now come up"- andthey came up!  Then the Fox said to the waves, "My friend, the Wolf,has come to see you, so you will come up and go back till I bid youstop; and the Wolf saw with wonder the waves coming up and going back.He said to the Fox, "May I go into the Sea?""As far as you like.  Don't be afraid, for at a word, the Sea would goor come as I bid, and as you have already seen."The Wolf believed the Fox, and followed the waves rather far from theshore.  A great wave soon upset him, and threw his carcass on theshore.  The Fox made a hearty breakfast on it.THE FOX IN THE WELLBy Ramaswami RajuA FOX fell into a well and was holding hard to some roots at the sideof it, just above the water.  A Wolf, who was passing by, saw him, andsaid, "Hello, Reynard, after all you have fallen into a well!""But not without a purpose, and not without the means of getting out ofit," said the Fox."What do you mean?" said the Wolf."Why," said the Fox, "there is a drought all over the country now, andthe water in this well is the only means of appeasing the thirst of thethousands that live in this neighborhood.  They held a meeting, andrequested me to keep the water from going down lower; so I am holdingit up for the public good.""What will be your reward?" said the 'Wolf."They will give me a pension, and save me the trouble of going aboutevery day in quest of food, not to speak of innumerable otherprivileges that will be granted me.  Further, I am not to stay here allday.  I have asked a kinsman of mine, to whom I have communicated thesecret of holding up the water, to relieve me from time to time.  Ofcourse he will also get a pension, and have other privileges.  I expecthim here shortly.""Ah, Reynard, may I relieve you, then?  May I hope to get a pension andother privileges?  You know what a sad lot is mine, especially inwinter.""Certainly," said the Fox; "but you must get a long rope, that I maycome up and let you in.So the Wolf got a rope.  Up came the Fox and down went the wo1f, whenthe former observed, with a laugh, "My dear sir, you may remain theretill doomsday, or till the owner of the well throws up your carcass,"and left the place.ASHIEPATTLE AND HIS GOODLY CREWBy P. C. AsbjörnsenONCE upon a time there was a king, and this king had heard about a shipwhich went just as fast by land as by water; and as he wished to haveone like it, he promised his daughter and half the kingdom to anyonewho could build one for him.  And this was given out at every churchall over the country.  There were many who tried, as you can imagine;for they thought it would be a nice thing to have half the kingdom, andthe princess wouldn't be a bad thing into the bargain.  But they allfared badly.Now there were three brothers, who lived far away on the borders of aforest; the eldest was called Peter, the second Paul, and the youngestEspen Ashiepattle, because he always sat in the hearth, raking anddigging in the ashes.It so happened that Ashiepattle was at church on the Sunday when theproclamation about the ship, which the king wanted, was read.  When hecame home amid told his family, Peter, the eldest, asked his mother toget some food ready for him, for now he was going away to try if hecould build the ship and win the princess and half the kingdom.  Whenthe bag was ready lie set out.  On the way he met an old man who wasvery crooked and decrepit."Where are you going?" said the man."I'm going into the forest to make a trough for my father.  He doesn'tlike to eat at table in our company," said Peter."Trough it shall he!" said the man.  "What have you got in that bag ofyours?" he added."Stones," said Peter."Stones it shall be," said the man.  Peter then went into the forestand began to cut and chop away at the trees and work away as hard as hecould, but in spite of all his cutting and chopping he could only turnout troughs.  Toward dinner time he wanted something to eat and openedhis bag.  But there was not a crumb of food in it.  As he had nothingto live upon, and as he did not turn out anything but troughs, hebecame tired of the work, took his ax and bag on his shoulder, and wenthome to his mother.Paul then wanted to set out to try his luck at building the ship andwinning the princess and half the kingdom.  He asked his mother forprovisions, and when the bag was ready he threw it over his shoulderand went on his way to the forest.  On the road he met the old man, whowas very crooked and decrepit."Where are you going?" said the man."Oh, I am going into the forest to make a trough for our sucking pig,"said Paul."Pig trough it shall be," said the man.  "What have you got in that bagof yours?" added the man."Stones," said Paul. "Stones it shall be," said the man.Paul then began felling trees and working away as hard as he could, butno matter how he cut and how he worked he could only turn out pigtroughs.  He did not give in, however, but worked away till far intothe afternoon before he thought of taking any food; then all at once hebecame hungry and opened his bag, but not a crumb could he find.  Paulbecame so angry he turned the bag inside out and struck it against thestump of a tree; then lie took his ax, went out of the forest, and setoff homeward.As soon as Paul returned, Ashiepattle wanted to set out and asked hismother for a bag of food."Perhaps I can manage to build the ship and win the princess and halfthe kingdom," said he."Well, I never heard the like," said his mother.  "Are you likely towin the princess, you, who never do anything but root and dig in theashes?  No, you shan't have any bag with food!"Ashiepattle did not give in, however, but he prayed and begged till hegot leave to go.  He did not get any food, not he; but he stole acouple of oatmeal cakes and some flat beer and set out.When he had walked a while he met the same old man, who was so crookedand tattered and decrepit."'Where are you going?" said the man."Oh, I was going into the forest to try if it were possible to build aship which can go as fast by land as by water," said Ashiepattle, "forthe king has given out that anyone who can build such a ship shall havethe princess and half the kingdom.""What have you got in that bag of yours?" said the man."Not much worth talking about; there ought to be a little food in it,"answered Ashiepattle."If you'll give me a little of it I'll help you, said the man."With all my heart," said Ashiepattle, "but there is nothing but someoatmeal cakes and a drop of flat beer."It didn't matter what it was, the man said; if he only got some of ithe would be sure to help Ashiepattle.When they came up to an old oak in the wood the man said to the lad,"Now you must cut off a chip and then put it back again in exactly thesame place, and when you have done that you can lie down and go tosleep."Ashiepattle did as he was told and then lay down to sleep, and in hissleep lie thought he heard somebody cutting and hammering and sawingand carpentering, but he could not wake up till the man called him;then the ship stood quite finished by the side of the oak."Now you must go on board and everyone you meet you must take withyou," said the man.  Espen Ashiepattle thanked him for the ship, saidhe would do so, and then sailed away.When he had sailed some distance he came to a long, thin tramp, who waslying near some rocks, eating stones."What sort of a fellow are you, that you lie there eating stones?"asked Ashiepattle.  The tramp said he was so fond of meat he couldnever get enough, therefore he was obliged to eat stones.  And then heasked if he might go with him in the ship."If you want to go with us, you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would, but he must take with him some large stones forfood.When they had sailed some distance they met one who was lying on theside of a sunny hill, sucking at a bung."Who are you," said Ashiepattle, "and what is the good of lying theresucking that bung?""Oh, when one hasn't got the barrel, one must be satisfied with thebung," said the man.  "I'm always so thirsty, I can never get enoughbeer and wine."  And then he asked for leave to go with him in theship."If you want to go with me you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would.  And so he went on board and took the bung with himto allay his thirst.When they had sailed a while again they met one who was lying with hisear to the ground, listening."Who are you, and what is the good of lying there on the groundlistening?" said Ashiepattle."I'm listening to the grass, for I have such good ears that I can hearthe grass growing," said the man.  And then he asked leave to go withhim in the ship.  Ashiepattle could not say nay to that, so he said:"If you want to go with me, you must make haste and get on board."Yes, the man would.  And he also went on board.When they had sailed some distance they came to one who was standingtaking aim with a gun."Who are you, and what is the good of standing there aiming like that?"asked Ashiepattle.So the man said: "I have such good eyes that I can hit anything, rightto the end of the world." And then he asked for leave to go with him inthe ship."If you want to go with me, you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would.  And he went on board.When they had sailed some distance again they came to one who washopping and limping about on one leg, and on the other he had seven tonweights."Who are you, said Ashiepattle, "and what is the good of hopping andlimping about on one leg with seven ton weights on the other?""I am so light," said the man, "that if I walked on both my legs Ishould get to the end of the world in less than five minutes." And thenhe asked for leave to go with him in the ship."If you want to go with us, you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would.  And so he joined Ashiepattle and his crew on theship.When they had sailed on some distance they met one who was standingholding his hand to his mouth."Who are you?" said Ashiepattle, "and what is the good of standingthere, holding your mouth like that?""Oh, I have seven summers and fifteen winters in my body," said theman; "so I think I ought to keep my mouth shut, for if they get out allat the same time they would finish off the world altogether."  And thenhe asked for leave to go with him in the ship."If you want to go with us you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would, and then he joined the others on the ship.When they had sailed a long time they came to the king's palace.Ashiepattle went straight in to the king and said the ship stood readyin the courtyard outside; and now he wanted the princess, as the kinghad promised.The king did not like this very much, for Ashiepattle did not cut avery fine figure; he was black and sooty, and the king did not care togive his daughter to such a tramp, so he told Ashiepattle that he wouldhave to wait a little."But you can have her all the same, if by this time to-morrow you canempty my storehouse of three hundred barrels of meat," said the king."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle; "but perhaps you don't mindmy taking one of my crew with me?""Yes, you can do that, and take all six if you like," said the king,for he was quite sure that even if Ashiepattle took six hundred withhim, it would be impossible.  So Ashiepattle took with him the one whoate stones and always hungered after meat.When they came next morning and opened the storehouse they found he hadeaten all the meat, except six small legs of mutton, one for each ofhis companions.  Ashiepattle then went to the king and said thestorehouse was empty, and he supposed he could now have the princess.The king went into the storehouse and, sure enough, it was quite empty;but Ashiepattle was still black and sooty, and the king thought it wasreally too bad that such a tramp should have his daughter.  So he saidhe had a cellar full of beer and old wine, three hundred barrels ofeach kind, which he would have him drink first."I don't mind your having my daughter if you can drink them up by thistime to-morrow," said the king."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle, "but perhaps you don't mindmy taking one of my crew with me?""Yes, you may do that," said the king, for he was quite sure there wastoo much beer and wine even for all seven of them.  Ashiepattle tookwith him the one who was always sucking the bung and was alwaysthirsty; and the king then shut them down in the cellar.There the thirsty one drank barrel after barrel, as long as there wasany left, but in the last barrel he left a couple of pints to each ofhis companions.In the morning the cellar was opened and Ashiepattle went at once tothe king and said he had finished the beer and wine, and now hesupposed he could have the princess as the king had promised."Well, I must first go down to the cellar and see," said the king, forhe could not believe it; but when he got there he found nothing butempty barrels.But Ashiepattle was both black and sooty and the king thought itwouldn't do for him to have such a son in law.  So he said that ifAshiepattle could get water from the end of the world in ten minutesfor the princess's tea, he could have both her and half the kingdom;for he thought that task would be quite impossible."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle, and sent for the one of hiscrew who jumped about on one leg and had seven ton weights on theother, and told him he must take off the weights and use his legs asquickly as he could, for he must have water from the end of the worldfor the princess's tea in ten minutes.So he took off the weights, got a bucket, and set off, and the nextmoment he was out of sight.  But they waited and waited and still hedid not return.  At last it wanted but three minutes to the time andthe king became as pleased as if he had won a big wager.Then Ashiepattle called the one who could hear the grass grow and toldhim to listen and find out what had become of their companion."He has fallen asleep at the well"," said he who could hear the grassgrow; "I can hear him snoring, and a troll is scratching his head."Ashiepattle then called the one who could shoot to the end of the worldand told him to send a bullet into the troll; he did so and hit thetroll right in the eye.  The troll gave such a yell that he woke theman who had come to fetch the water for the tea, and when he returnedto the palace there was still one minute left out of the ten.Ashiepattle went straight to the king and said:  "Here is the water;"and now he supposed he could have the princess, for surely the kingwould not make any more fuss about it now.  But the king thought thatAshiepattle was just as black and sooty as ever, and did not like tohave him for a son-in-law; so he said he had three hundred fathoms ofwood with which he was going to dry corn in the bakehouse, and hewouldn't mind Ashiepattle having his daughter if he would first sit inthe bakehouse and burn all the wood; he should then have the princess,and that without fail."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle; "but perhaps you don't mindmy taking one of my crew with me?""Oh, no, you can take all six," said the king, for he thought it wouldbe warm enough for all of them.Ashiepattle took with him the one who had fifteen winters and sevensummers in his body, and in the evening he went across to thebakehouse: but the king had piled up so much wood on the fire that youmight almost have melted iron in the room.  They could not get out ofit, for no sooner were they inside than the king fastened the bolt andput a couple of padlocks on the door besides.  Ashiepattle then said tohis companion:"You had better let out six or seven winters, so that we may getsomething like summer weather here."They were then just able to exist, but during the night it got coldagain and Ashiepattle then told the man to let out a couple of summers,and so they slept far into the next day.  But when they heard the kingoutside Ashiepattle said:"You must let out a couple more winters, but you must manage it so thatthe last winter you let out strikes the king right in the face."He did so, and when the king opened the door, expecting to findAshiepattle and his companion burned to cinders, he saw them huddlingtogether and shivering with cold till their teeth chattered.  The sameinstant Ashiepattle's companion with the fifteen winters in his bodylet loose the last one right in the king's face, which swelled up intoa big chilblain."Can I have the princess now?" asked Ashiepattle"Yes, take her and keep her and the kingdom into the bargain," said theking, who dared not refuse any longer.  And so the wedding took placeand they feasted and made merry and fired off guns and powder.While the people were running about searching for wadding for theirguns, they took me instead, gave me some porridge in a bottle and somemilk in a basket, and fired me right across here, so that I could tellyou how it all happened.THE SQUIRE'S BRIDEBy P.  C.  AsbjörnsenONCE UPON a time there was a rich squire who owned a large farm, andhad plenty of silver at the bottom of his chest and money in the bankbesides; but he felt there was something wanting, for he was a widower.One day the daughter of a neighboring farmer was working for him in thehayfield.  The squire saw her and liked her very much, and as she wasthe child of poor parents he thought if he only hinted that he wantedher she would be ready to marry him at once.So he told her he had been thinking of getting married again."Aye!  one may think of many things," said the girl, laughing slyly.In her opinion the old fellow ought to be thinking of something thatbehooved him better than getting married."Well, you see, I thought that you should be my wife!""No, thank you all the same," said she, "that's not at all likely."The squire was not accustomed to be gainsaid, and the more she refusedhim the more determined he was to get her.But as he made no progress in her favor he sent for her father and toldhim that if he could arrange the matter with his daughter he wouldforgive him the money he had lent him, and he would also give him thepiece of land which lay close to his meadow into the bargain."Yes, you may be sure I'll bring my daughter to her senses," said thefather.  "She is only a child, and she doesn't know what's best forher."  But all his coaxing and talking did not help matters.  She wouldnot have the squire, she said, if he sat buried in gold up to his ears.The squire waited day after day, but at last he became so angry andimpatient that he told the father, if he expected him to stand by hispromise, he would have to put his foot down and settle the matter now,for he would not wait any longer.The man knew no other way out of it but to let the squire geteverything ready for the wedding; and when the parson and the weddingguests had arrived the squire should send for the girl as if she werewanted for some work on the farm.  When she arrived she would have tobe married right away, so that she would have no time to think it over.The squire thought this was well and good, and so he began brewing andbaking and getting ready for the wedding in grand style.  When theguests had arrived the squire called one of his farm lads and told himto run down to his neighbor and ask him to send him what he hadpromised."But if you are not back in a twinkling," he said, shaking his fist athim, "I'll-"He did not say more, for the lad ran off as if he had been shot at."My master has sent me to ask for that you promised him," said the lad,when he got to the neighbor, "but there is no time to be lost, for heis terribly busy to-day.""Yes, yes!  Run down into the meadow and take her with you.  There shegoes!" answered the neighbor.The lad ran off and when he came to the meadow he found the daughterthere raking the hay."I am to fetch what your father has promised my master," said the lad."Ah, ha!" thought she.  "Is that what they are up to?""Ah, indeed!" she said.  "I suppose it's that little bay mare of ours.You had better go and take her.  She stands there tethered on the otherside of the pea field," said the girl.The boy jumped on the back of the bay mare and rode home at fullgallop."Have you got her with you?" asked the squire."She is down at the door," said the lad."Take her up to the room my mother had," said the squire."But master, how can that be managed?" said the lad."You must just do as I tell you," said the squire.  "If you cannotmanage her alone you must get the men to help you," for he thought thegirl might turn obstreperous.When the lad saw his master's face he knew it would be no use togainsay him.  So he went and got all the farm tenants who were there tohelp him.  Some pulled at the head and the forelegs of the mare andothers pushed from behind, and at last they got her up the stairs andinto the room.  There lay all the wedding finery ready."Now, that's done master!" said the lad; "but it was a terrible job.It was the worst I have ever had here on the farm."Never mind, you shall not have done it for nothing," said his master."Now send the women up to dress her.""But I say master-!" said the lad."None of your talk!" said the squire.  "Tell them they must dress herand mind and not forget either wreath or crown.The lad ran into the kitchen."Look here, lasses," he said; "you must go upstairs and dress up thebay mare as bride.  I expect the master wants to give the guests alaugh."The women dressed the bay mare in everything that was there, and thenthe lad went and told his master that now she was ready dressed, withwreath and crown and all."Very well, bring her down!" said the squire.  "I will receive hermyself at the door," said he.There was a terrible clatter on the stairs; for that bride, you know,had no silken shoes on.When the door was opened and the squire's bride entered the parlor youcan imagine there was a good deal of tittering and grinning.And as for the squire you may he sure line had had enough of thatbride, and they say he never went courting again.THE DOLL IN THE GRASSBy P.  C.  AsbjörnsenONCE upon a time there was a king who had twelve sons.  When they weregrown up he told them they must go out into the world and findthemselves wives, who must all be able to spin and weave and make ashirt in one day, else he would not have them for daughters-in-law.  Hegave each of his sons a horse and a new suit of armor, and so they setout in the world to look for wives.When they had traveled a bit on the way they said they would not takeAshiepattle with them, for he was good for nothing.  Ashiepattle muststop behind; there was no help for it.  He did not know what he shoulddo or which way he should turn; he became so sad that he got off thehorse and sat down on the grass and began to cry.When he had sat a while one of the tussocks among the grass began tomove, and out of it came a small white figure; as it came nearerAshiepattle saw that it was a beautiful little girl, but she was sotiny, so very, very tiny.She went up to him and asked him if he would come below and pay a visitto the doll in the grass.Yes, that he would; and so he did.  When he came down below, the dollin the grass was sitting in a chair dressed very finely and lookingstill more beautiful.  She asked Ashiepattle where he was going andwhat was his errand.He told her they were twelve brothers, and that the king had given themeach a horse and a suit of armor, and told them to go out in the worldand find themselves wives, but they must all be able to spin and weaveand make a shirt in a day."If you can do that and will become my wife, I will not travel anyfarther," said Ashiepattle to the doll in the grass.Yes, that she would, and she set to work at once to get the shirt spun,woven, and made; but it was so tiny, so very, very tiny, no biggerthan-so!Ashiepattle then returned home, taking the shirt with him; but when hebrought it out he felt very shy because it was so small.  But the kingsaid he could have her for all that, and you can imagine how happy andjoyful Ashiepattle became.The road did not seem long to him as he set out to fetch his littlesweetheart.  When he came to the doll in the grass he wanted her to sitwith him on his horse; but no, that she wouldn't; she said she wouldsit and drive in a silver spoon, and she had two small while horseswhich would draw her.  So they set out, he on his horse and she in thesilver spoon; and the horses which drew her were two small white mice.Ashiepattle always kept to one side of the road, for he was so afraidhe should ride over her; she was so very, very tiny.When they had traveled a bit on the way they came to a large lake;there Ashiepattle's horse took fright and shied over to the other sideof the road, and upset the spoon, so that the doll in the grass fellinto the water.  Ashiepattle became very sad, for he did not know howhe should get her out again; but after a while a merman brought her up.But now she had become just as big as any other grown-up being and wasmuch more beautiful than she was before.  So he placed her in front ofhim on the horse and rode home.When Ashiepattle got there all his brothers had also returned, eachwith a sweetheart; but they were so ugly and ill-favored and bad-tempered that they had come to blows with their sweethearts on theirway home.  On their heads they had hats which were painted with tar andsoot, and this had run from their hats down their faces, so that theywere still uglier and more ill-favored to behold.When the brothers saw Ashiepattle's sweetheart they all became enviousof him, but the king was so pleased with Ashiepattle and his sweetheartthat he drove all the others away, and so Ashiepattle was married tothe doll in the grass; and afterward they lived happy and comfortablefor a long, long while; and if they are not dead, they must be stillalive.THE BEAR AND THE FOXBy P.  C.  AsbjörnsenOnce upon a time there was a bear, who sat on a sunny hillside taking anap.  Just then a fox came slinking by and saw him."Aha!  have I caught you napping, grandfather?  See if I don't play youa trick this time!" said Reynard to himself.He then found three wood mice and laid them on a stump of a tree justunder the bear's nose."Boo!  Bruin!  Peter the hunter is just behind that stump!" shouted thefox right into the bear's ear, and then took to his heels and made offinto the wood.The bear woke at once, and when he saw the three mice he became soangry that he lifted his paw and was just going to strike them, for hethought it was they who had shouted in his ear.But just then he saw Reynard's tail between the bushes and he set offat such a speed that the branches crackled under him, and Bruin wassoon so close upon Reynard that he caught him by the right hind legjust as be was running into a hole under a pine tree.Reynard was now in a fix; but he was not to be outwitted, and he cried:"Slip pine root, grip fox foot," and so the bear let go his hold; butthe fox laughed far down in the hole and said:"I sold you that time, also, grandfather!""Out of sight is not out of mind!" said the bear, who was in a finefury.The other morning, when Bruin came trudging across the moor with a fatpig, Master Reynard was lying on a stone by the moorside."Good-day, grandfather!" said the fox.  "What nice thing have you gotthere?""Pork," said the bear."I have got something tasty as well," said the fox."What's that?" said the bear."It's the biggest bees' nest I ever found," said Reynard."Ah, indeed," said the bear, grinning, and his mouth began to water, hethought a little honey would be so nice.  "Shall we change victuals?"he said."No, I won't do that," said Reynard.  But they made a wager aboutnaming three kinds of trees.  If the fox could say them quicker thanthe bear he was to have one bite at the pig; but if the bear could saythem quicker he was to have one suck at the bee's nest.  The bearthought he would be able to suck all the honey up at one gulp."Well said the fox, "that's all well and good but if I win you mustpromise to tear off the bristles where I want to have a bite," he said."Well, I suppose I must, since you are too lazy yourself," said thebear.Then they began to name the trees."Spruce, fir, pine," growled the bear.  His voice was very gruff.  Butall these were only different names of one kind of tree."Ash, aspen, oak," screeched the fox, so that the forest resounded.  Hehad thus won the bet, and so he jumped down, took the heart out of thepig at one bite, and tried to run off.  But the bear was angry, becausehe had taken the best bit of the whole pig, and seized hold of him byhis tail and held him fast."Just wait a bit," said the bear, who was furious."Never mind, grandfather; if you'll let me go you shall have a taste ofmy honey," said the fox.When the bear heard this he let go his hold and the fox jumped up onthe stone after the honey."Over this nest," said Reynard, "I'll put a leaf, and in the leaf thereis a hole, through which you can suck the honey."  He then put the nestright up under the bear's nose, pulled away the leaf, jumped on to thestone, and began grinning and laughing; for there was neither honey norhoneycomb in the nest.  It was a wasp's nest as big as a man's head,full of wasps, and out they swarmed and stung the bear in his eyes andears and on his mouth and snout.  He had so much to do with scratchingthem off him that he had no the to think of Reynard.Ever since the bear has been afraid of wasps.Once the fox and the bear made up their minds to have a field incommon.  They found a small clearing far away in the forest, where theysowed rye the first year."Now we must share and share alike," said Reynard; "if you will havethe roots I will have the tops," he said.Yes, Bruin was quite willing; but when they had thrashed the crop thefox got all the corn, while the bear got nothing but the roots andtares.Bruin didn't like this, but the fox said it was only as they hadagreed."This year I am the gainer," said the fox; "another year it will beyour turn; you can then have the tops and I will be satisfied with theroots."Next spring the fox asked the bear if he didn't think turnips would bethe right thing for that year."Yes, that's better food than corn," said the bear; and the fox thoughtthe same.When the autumn came the fox took the turnips, but the bear only gotthe tops.The bear then became so angry that he parted company then and therewith Reynard.One day the bear was lying eating a horse which he had killed.  Reynardwas about again and came slinking along, his mouth watering for a tastybit of the horseflesh.He sneaked in and out and round about till he came up behind the bear,when he made a spring to the other side of the carcass, snatching apiece as he jumped across.The bear was not slow either; he made a dash after Reynard and caughtthe tip of his red tail in his paw.  Since that time the fox has alwayshad a white tip to his tail."Wait a bit Reynard, and come here," said the bear, "and I'll teach youhow to catch horses."Yes, Reynard was quite willing to learn that, but he didn't trusthimself too near the bear."When you see a horse lying asleep in a sunny place," said the bear,"you must tie yourself fast with the hair of his tail to your brush,and then fasten your teeth in his thigh," he said.Before long the fox found a horse lying asleep on a sunny hillside; andso he did as the bear had told him; he knotted and tied himself well tothe horse with the hair of the tail and then fastened his teeth intohis thigh.Up jumped the horse and began to kick and gallop so that Reynard wasdashed against stock and stone, and was so bruised and battered that henearly lost his senses.All at once a hare rushed by.  "Where are you off to in such a hurry,Reynard?" said the hare."I'm having a ride, Bunny!" said the fox.The hare sat up on his hind legs and laughed till the sides of hismouth split right up to his ears, at the thought of Reynard having sucha grand ride; but since then the fox has never thought of catchinghorses again.That time it was Bruin who for once had the better of Reynard;otherwise they say the bear is as simple-minded as the trolls.THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WINDBy Sir George Webbe DasentOnce upon a time there was an old widow who had one son, and she waspoorly and weak, her son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal forcooking; but when he got outside the safe, and was just going down thesteps, there came the North Wind, puffing and blowing, caught up themeal, and so away with it through the air.  Then the lad went back intothe safe for more; but when he came out again on the steps, if theNorth Wind didn't come again and carry off the meal with a puff; andmore than that, he did so the third time.  At this the lad got veryangry; and as he thought it hard that the North Wind should behave so,he thought he'd just look him up and ask him to give up his meal.So off he went, but the way was long, and he walked and walked; but atlast he came to the North Wind's house."Good day!" said the lad, and "thank you for coming to see usyesterday.""GOOD DAY!" answered the North Wind, for his voice was loud and gruff,"AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME.  WHAT DO YOU WANT?""Oh!" answered the lad, "I only wished to ask you to be so good as tolet me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps, for wehaven't much to live on; and if you're to go on snapping up the morselwe have there'll be nothing for it but to starve.""I haven't got your meal," said the North Wind; "but if you are in suchneed, I'll give you a cloth which will get you everything you want, ifyou only say, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of gooddishes!'"With this the lad was well content.  But, as the way was so long hecouldn't get home in one day, he stopped at an inn on the way; and whenthey were going to sit down to supper, he laid the cloth on a tablewhich stood in the corner and said:"Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid; and all whostood by thought it a fine thing, but most of all the landlady.  So,when all were fast asleep, at dead of night, she took the lad's cloth,and put another in its stead, just like the one he had got from theNorth Wind, but which couldn't so much as serve up a bit of dry bread.So when the lad awoke, he took his cloth and went off with it, and thatday he got home to his mother."Now," said he, "I've been to the North Wind's house, and a good fellowhe is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, 'Cloth,spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes,' I get any sortof food I please.""All very true, I dare say," said his mother, "but seeing is believing,and I shan't believe it till I see it."So the lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, andsaid- "Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve"Well," said the lad, "there's no help for it but to go to the NorthWind again;" and away he went.So late in the afternoon he came to where the North Wind lived."Good evening!" said the lad."Good evening!" said the North Wind.  "I want my rights for that mealof ours which you took," said the lad; "for, as for that cloth I got,it isn't worth a penny.""I've got no meal," said the North Wind; "but yonder you have a ramwhich coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it-"'Ram, ram!  Make money!'"So the lad thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get homethat day, he stopped for the night at the same inn where he had sleptbefore.Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the NorthWind had said of the ram, and found it all right; but when the landlordsaw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when the lad had fallenasleep, he took another which couldn't coin gold ducats, and changedthe two.Next morning off went the lad; and when he got home to his mother, hesaid-"After all, the North Wind is a jolly fellow; for now he has givenme a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say, 'Ram, ram!  Makemoney!'""All very true, I dare say," said his mother; "but I shan't believe anysuch stuff until I see the ducats made.""Ram, ram!  Make money!" said the lad; but the ram made no money.So the lad went back again to the North Wind, and blew him up, and saidthe ram was worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal."Well," said the North Wind, "I've nothing else to give you but thatold stick in the corner yonder; but it's a stick of that kind that ifyou say- 'Stick, stick!  lay on!' it lays on till you say, 'Stick,stick!  now stop!'So, as the way was long the lad turned in this night, too, to thelandlord; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to thecloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore,as if he were asleep.Now the landlord, who easily saw that the stick must be worthsomething, hunted up one which was like it, and when he heard the ladsnore, was going to change the two, but just as the landlord was aboutto take it, the lad bawled out- "Stick, stick!  lay on!"So the stick began to beat the landlord till he jumped over chairs, andtables, and benches, and yelled and roared,- "Oh my!  oh my!  bid thestick be still, else it will beat me to death, and you shall have backyour cloth and your ram,When the lad thought the landlord had got enough, he said- "Stick,stick!  now stop!"Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket, and went home withhis stick in his hand, leading the ram by a cord round its horns; andso he got his rights for the meal he had lost.THE HUSBAND WHO WAS TO MIND THE HOUSEBy Sir George Webbe DasentONCE upon a time there was a man, so surly and cross, he never thoughthis wife did anything right in the house.  So one evening in haymakingtime, he came home, scolding and swearing, and showing his teeth andmaking a dust."Dear love, don't be so angry; there's a good man," said his goody;"to-morrow let's change our work.  I'll go out with the mowers and mow,and you shall mind the house at home."Yes, the husband thought that would do very well.  He was quitewilling, he said.So early next morning his goody took a scythe over her neck, and wentout into the hayfield with the mowers and began to mow; but the man wasto mind the house, and do the work at home.First of all he wanted to churn the butter; but when he had churned awhile, he got thirsty, and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel ofale.  So, just when he had knocked in the bung, and was putting the tapinto the cask, he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen.  Thenoff he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, as fast as hecould, to look after the pig, lest it should upset the churn; but whenhe got up, and saw that the pig had already knocked the churn over, andstood there, routing and grunting amid the cream which was running allover the floor, he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot his alebarrel and ran at the pig as hard as he could.  He caught it, too, justas it ran out of doors, and gave it such a kick that piggy lay for deadon the spot.  Then all at once he remembered he had the tap in hishand, but when he got down to the cellar, every drop of ale had run outof the cask.Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill thechurn again, and so he began to churn, for butter they must have fordinner.  When he had churned a bit, he remembered that their milkingcow was still shut up in the brye, and hadn't had a bit to eat or adrop to drink all the morning, though the sun was high.  Then all atonce he thought 'twas too far to take her down to the meadow, so he'djust get her up on the housetop-for the house, you must know, wasthatched with sods, and a fine crop of grass was growing there.Now their house lay close up against a steep down, and he thought if helaid a plank across to the thatch at the back he'd easily get the cowup.But still he couldn't leave the churn, for there was his little babecrawling about the floor, and "if I leave it," he thought, "the childis sure to upset it!"  So he took the churn on his back, and went outwith it; but then he thought he'd better first water the cow before heturned her out on the thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw water outof the well; but, as he stooped down at the well's brink, all the creamran out of the churn over his shoulders, and so down into the well.Now it was near dinner time, and he hadn't even got the butter yet; sohe thought he'd best boil the porridge, and filled the pot with water,and hung it over the fire.  When he had done that, he thought the cowmight perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck.  Sohe got up on the house to tie her up.  One end of the rope he made fastto the cow's neck, and the other he slipped down the chimney and tiedround his own thigh; and he had to make haste, for the water now beganto boil in the pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal.So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at it, down fell thecow off the housetop after all, and as she fell, she dragged the man upthe chimney by the rope.  There he stuck fast; and as for the cow, shehung halfway down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth, for shecould neither get down nor up.And now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for herhusband to come and call them home to dinner; but never a call theyhad.  At last she thought she'd waited long enough, and went home.  Butwhen she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place, sheran up and cut the rope in two with her scythe.  But as she did this,down came her husband out of the chimney; and so when his old dame cameinside the kitchen, there she found him standing on his head in theporridge pot.HOW ONE WENT OUT TO WOOBy Sir George Webbe DasentO NCE upon a time there was a lad who went out to woo him a wife.Among other places he came to a farmhouse, where the household werelittle better than beggars; but when the wooer came in they wanted tomake out that they were well to do, as you may guess.  Now the husbandhad got a new arm to his coat."Pray, take a seat," he said to the wooer; "but there's a shocking dustin the house."So he went about rubbing and wiping all the benches and tables with hisnew arm, but he kept the other all the while behind his back.The wife she had got one new shoe, and she went stamping and slidingwith it up against the stools and chairs saying, "How untidy it ishere!  Everything is out of place!"Then they called out to their daughter to come down and put things torights; but the daughter she had got a new cap; so she put her head inat the door, and kept nodding and nodding, first to this side and thento that."Well!  For my part, She said, I can't be everywhere at once."Aye!  Aye! That was a well-to-do household the wooer had come to.WHY THE BEAR IS STUMPY-TAILEDBy Sir George Webbe DasentONE day the Bear met the Fox, who came slinking along with a string offish he had stolen."Whence did you get these from?" asked the Bear."Oh! My Lord Bruin, I've been out fishing and caught them," said theFox.So the Bear had a mind to learn to fish too, and bade the Fox tell himhow he was to set about it."Oh! It's an easy craft for you", answered the Fox, "and soon learned.You've only got to go upon the ice, and cut a hole and stick your taildown into it; and so you must go on holding it there as long as youcan.  You're not to mind if your tail smarts a little; that's when thefish bite.  The longer you hold it there the more fish you'll get; andthen all at once out with it, with a cross pull sideways, and with astrong pull too."Yes; the Bear did as the Fox had said, and held his tail a long, longthe down in the hole, till it was fast frozen in.  Then he pulled itout with a cross pull, and it snapped short off.  That's why Bruin goesabout with a stumpy tail this very day.BOOTS WHO MADE THE PRINCESS SAY "THAT'S A STORY"By Sir George Webbe DasentONCE upon a time there was a King who had a daughter, and she was sucha dreadful storyteller that the like of her was not to be found far ornear.  So the King gave out, that if anyone could tell such a string oflies as would get her to say, "That's a story," he should have her towife, and half the kingdom besides.  Well, many came, as you may fancy,to try their luck, for everyone would have been very glad to have thePrincess, to say nothing of the kingdom; but they all cut a sorryfigure, for the Princess was so given to storytelling, that all theirlies went in at one ear and out of the other.  Among the rest camethree brothers to try their luck, and the two elder went first, butthey fared no better than those that had gone before them.  Last ofall, the third, Boots, set off and found the Princess in the farmyard."Good morning," he said, "and thank you for nothing."  "Good morning,"said she, "and the same to you."  Then she went on-"You haven't such a fine farmyard as ours, I'll be bound; for when twoshepherds stand, one at each end of it, and blow their ram's horns, theone can't hear the other.""Haven't we though!" answered Boots; "ours is far bigger; for when acalf starts to cross a field, it is a full-grown cow when it reachesthe other end.""I dare say," said the Princess.  "Well, but you haven't such a big ox,after all, as ours yonder; for when two men sit, one on each horn, theycan't touch each other with a tweny-foot rule.""Stuff!" said Boots; "is that all?  Why, we have an ox who is so big,that when two men sit, one on each horn, and each blows his greatmountain-trumpet, they can't hear one another.""I dare say," said the Princess; "but you haven't so much milk as we,I'll be bound; for we milk our cows into great pails, and carry themindoors, and empty them into great tubs, and so we make great, greatcheeses.""Oh!  you do, do you?" said Boots.  "Well, we milk ours into greattubs, and then we put them in carts and drive them indoors, and then weturn them out into great brewing vats, and so we make cheeses as big asa great house.  We had, too, a dun mare to tread the cheese welltogether when it was making; but once she tumbled down into the cheese,and we lost her; and after we had eaten at this cheese seven years, wecame upon a great dun mare, alive and kicking.  Well, once after that Iwas going to drive this mare to the mill, and her backbone snapped intwo; but I wasn't put out, not I; for I took a spruce sapling, and putit into her for a backbone, and she had no other backbone all the whilewe had her.  But the sapling grew up into such a tall tree, that Iclimbed right up to the sky by it, and when I got there I saw a ladysitting and spinning the foam of the sea into pigs'-bristle ropes; butjust then the spruce-fir broke short off, and I couldn't get downagain; so the lady let me down by one of the ropes, and down I slippedstraight into a fox's hole, and who should sit there but my mother andyour father cobbling shoes; and just as I stepped in, my mother gaveyour father such a box on the ear that it made his whiskers curl.""That's a story!" said the Princess, "my father never did any suchthing in all his born days!"So Boots got the Princess to wife, and half the kingdom besides.THE WITCH IN THE STONE BOATRetold by Andrew LangTHERE was once a king and queen, and they had a son called Sigurd, whowas very strong and active and good-looking.  When the king came to bebowed down with the weight of years he spoke to his son, and said thatnow it was time for him to look out for a fitting match for himself,for he did not know how long he might last now, and he would like tosee him married before he died.Sigurd was not averse to this and asked his father where he thought itbest to look for a wife.  The king answered that in a certain countrythere was a king who had a beautiful daughter, and he thought it wouldbe most desirable if Sigurd could get her.  So the two parted, andSigurd prepared for the journey and went to where his father haddirected him.He came to the king and asked his daughters hand, which was readilygranted him, but only on the condition that he should remain there aslong as he could, for the king himself was not strong and not very ableto govern his kingdom.  Sigurd accepted this condition, but added thathe would have to get leave to go home again to his own country when heheard news of his father's death.  After that Sigurd married theprincess and helped his father-in-law to govern the kingdom.  He andthe princess loved each other dearly, and after a year a son came tothem, who was two years old when word came to Sigurd that his fatherwas dead.  Sigurd now prepared to return home with his wife and childand went on board ship to go by sea.They had sailed for several days, when the breeze suddenly fell andthere came a dead calm at a time when they needed only one day's voyageto reach home.  Sigurd and his queen were one day on deck when most ofthe others on the ship had fallen asleep.  There they sat and talkedfor a while, and had their little son along with them.  After a timeSigurd became so heavy with sleep that he could no longer keep awake,so he went below and lay down, leaving the queen alone on the deckplaying with her son.A good while after Sigurd had gone below the queen saw something blackon the sea which seemed to be coming nearer.  As it approached shecould make out that it was a boat and could see the figure of some onesitting in it and rowing it.  At last the boat came alongside the ship,and now the queen saw that it was a stone boat, out of which there cameon board the ship a fearfully ugly witch.  The queen was morefrightened than words can describe, and could neither speak a word normove from the place so as to awaken the king or the sailors.  The witchcame right up to the queen, took the child from her, and laid it on thedeck; then she took the queen and stripped her of all her fine clothes,which she proceeded to put on herself and looked then like a humanbeing.  Last of all she took the queen, put her into the boat and said:"This spell I lay upon you, that you slacken not your course until youcome to my brother in the under world."The queen sat stunned and motionless, but the boat at once shot awayfrom the ship with her, and before long she was out of sight.When the boat could no longer be seen the child began to cry, andthough the witch tried to quiet it she could not manage it; so, withthe child on her arm, she went below to where the king was sleeping,and awakened him, scolding him for leaving them alone on deck while heand all the crew were asleep.  It was great carelessness of him, shesaid, to leave no one to watch the ship with her.Sigurd was greatly surprised to hear his queen scold him so much, forshe had never said an angry word to him before; but he thought it wasquite excusable in this case, and tried to quiet the child along withher but it was no use.  Then he went and wakened the sailors and badethem hoist the sails, for a breeze had sprung up and was blowingstraight toward the harbor.They soon reached the land which Sigurd was to rule over, and found allthe people sorrowful for the old king's death, but they became gladwhen they got Sigurd back to the court, and made him king over them.The king's son, however, hardly ever stopped crying from the time hehad been taken from his mother on the deck of the ship, although he hadalways been such a good child before, so that at last the king had toget a nurse for him-one of the maids of the court.  As soon as thechild got into her charge he stopped crying and behaved as well asbefore.After the sea voyage it seemed to the king that the queen had alteredvery much in many ways, and not for the better.  He thought her muchmore haughty and stubborn and difficult to deal with than she used tobe.  Before long others began to notice this as well as the king.  Inthe court there were two young fellows, one of eighteen years old, theother of nineteen, who were very fond of playing chess and often satlong inside playing at it.  Their room was next the queen's, and oftenduring the day they heard the queen talking.One day they paid more attention than usual when they heard her talk,and put their ears close to a crack in the wall between the rooms, andheard the queen say quite plainly: 'When I yawn a little, then I am anice little maiden: when I yawn halfway, then I am half a troll; andwhen I yawn fully then I am a troll altogether."As she said this she yawned tremendously, and in a moment had put onthe appearance of a fearfully ugly troll.  Then there came up throughthe floor of the room a three-headed giant with a trough full of meat,who saluted her as his sister and set down the trough before her.  Shebegan to eat out of it and never stopped till she had finished it.  Theyoung fellows saw all this going on, but did not hear the two of themsay anything to each other.  They were astonished, though, at howgreedily the queen devoured the meat and how much she ate of it, andwere no longer surprised that she took so little when she sat at tablewith the king.  As soon as she had finished it the giant disappearedwith the trough by the same way as he had come, and the queen returnedto her human shape.Now we must go back to the king's son after he had been put in chargeof the nurse.  One evening. after she had lit a candle and was holdingthe child, several planks sprang up in the floor of the room, and outat the opening came a beautiful woman dressed in white, with an ironbelt round her waist, to which was fastened an iron chain that wentdown into the ground.  The woman came up to the nurse, took the childfrom her, and pressed it to her breast; then she gave it back to thenurse and returned by the same way as she had come, and the floorclosed over her again.  Although the woman had not spoken a single wordto her, the nurse was very much frightened, but told no one about it.Next evening the same thing happened again, just as before, but as thewoman was going away she said in a sad tone, "Two are gone and one onlyis left," and then disappeared as before.  The nurse was still morefrightened when she heard the woman say this, and thought that perhapssome danger was hanging over the child, though she had no ill opinionof the unknown woman, who, indeed, had behaved toward the child as ifit were her own.  The most mysterious thing was the woman saying "andonly one is left"; but the nurse guessed that this must mean that onlyone day was left, since she had come for two days already.At last the nurse made up her mind to go to the king.  She told him thewhole story and asked him to be present in person the next day aboutthe time when the woman usually came.  The king promised to do so, andcame to the nurse's room a little before the time and sat down on achair with his drawn sword in his hand.  Soon after the planks in thefloor sprang up as before, and the woman came up, dressed in white,with the iron belt and chain.  The king saw at once that it was his ownqueen, and immediately hewed asunder the iron chain that was fastenedto the belt.  This was followed by such noises and crashings down inthe earth that all the king's palace shook, so that no one expectedanything else than to see every bit of it shaken to pieces.  At lastthe noises and shaking stopped, and they began to come to themselvesagain.The king and queen embraced each other, and she told him the wholestory-how the witch came to the ship when they were all asleep and senther off in the boat.  After she had gone so far that she could not seethe ship, she sailed on through darkness until she landed beside athree-headed giant.  The giant wished her to marry him, but sherefused; whereupon he shut her up by herself and told her she wouldnever get free until she consented.  After a time she began to plan howto get her freedom, and at last told him that she would consent if hewould allow her to visit her son on earth three days on end.  This heagreed to, but put on her this iron belt and chain, the other end ofwhich he fastened around his, own waist, and the great noises that wereheard when the king cut the chain must have been caused by the giant'sfalling down the underground passage when the chain gave way sosuddenly.  The giant's dwelling, indeed, was right under the palace,and the terrible shakings must have been caused by him in his deaththroes.The king now understood how the queen he had had for some time past hadbeen so ill-tempered.  He at once had a sack drawn over her head andmade her be stoned to death, and after that torn in pieces by untamedhorses.  The two young fellows also told now what they had heard andseen in the queen's room, for before this they had been afraid to sayanything about it, on account of the Queen's power.The real queen was now restored to all her dignity and was beloved byall.  The nurse was married to a nobleman and the king and queen gaveher splendid presents.THE SNUFFIBOXBy Paul SébillotAs often happens in this world, there was once a young man who spentall his time in traveling.  One day, as he was walking along, he pickedup a snuffbox.  He opened it, and the snuffbox said to him in theSpanish language:  "What do you want?"  He was very much frightened,but, luckily, instead of throwing the box away he only shut it tightand put it in his pocket.  Then he went on, away, away, away, and as hewent he said to himself, "if it says to me again, 'What do you want?' Ishall know better what to say this time."  So he took out the snuffboxand opened it, and again it asked: "What do you want?"  "My hat full ofgold," answered the youth, and immediately it was full.Our young man was enchanted.  Henceforth he should never be in need ofanything.  So on he traveled, away, away, away, through thick forests,till at last he came to a beautiful castle.  In the castle there liveda king.  The young man walked round and round the castle, not caringwho saw him, till the king noticed him and asked what he was doingthere.  "I was just looking at your castle."  "You would like to haveone like it, wouldn't you?"  The young man did not reply, but when itgrew dark he took out his snuffbox and opened the lid."  What do youwant?"  "Build me a castle with laths of gold and tiles of diamond andthe furniture all of silver and gold."  He had scarcely finishedspeaking when there stood in front of him, exactly opposite the king'spalace, a castle built precisely as he had ordered.  When the kingawoke he was struck dumb at the sight of the magnificent house shiningin the rays of the sun.  The servants could not do their work forstopping to stare at it.  Then the king dressed himself and went to seethe young man.  And he told him plainly that he was a very powerfulprince, and that he hoped that they might all live together in onehouse or the other, and that the king would give him his daughter towife.  So it all turned out just as the king wished.  The young manmarried the princess and they lived happily in the palace of gold.But the king's wife was jealous both of the young man and of her owndaughter.  The princess had told her mother about the snuffbox, whichgave them everything they wanted, and the queen bribed a servant tosteal the snuffbox.  They noticed carefully where it was put away everynight, and one evening, when the whole world was asleep, the womanstole it and brought it to her old mistress.  Oh, how happy the queenwas!  She opened the lid and the snuffbox said to her: "What do youwant?"  And she answered at once: "I want you to take me and my husbandand my servants and this beautiful house and set us down on the otherside of the Red Sea, but my daughter and her husband are to staybehind."When the young couple woke up they found themselves back in the oldcastle, without their snuffbox.  They hunted for it high and low, butquite vainly.  The young man felt that no time was to be lost, and hemounted his horse and filled his pockets with as much gold as he couldcarry.  On he went, away, away, away, but he sought the snuffbox invain all up and down the neighboring countries, and very soon he cameto the end of all his money.  But still he went on, as fast as thestrength of his horse would let him, begging his way.Some one told him that he ought to consult the moon, for the moontraveled far and might be able to tell him something.  So he went away,away, away, and ended, somehow or other, by reaching the land of themoon.  There he found a little old woman who said to him: "What are youdoing here?  My son eats all living things he sees, and if you are wiseyou will go away without coming any farther."  But the young man toldher all his sad tale, and how he possessed a wonderful snuffbox, andhow it had been stolen from him, and how he had nothing left now thathe was parted from his wife and was in need of everything.  And he saidthat perhaps her son, who traveled so far, might have seen a palacewith laths of gold and tiles of diamond and furnished all in silver andgold.  As he spoke these last words the moon came in and said hesmelled mortal flesh and blood.  But his mother told him that it was anunhappy man who had lost everything and had come all this way toconsult him, and bade the young man not to be afraid, but to comeforward and show himself.  So he went boldly up to the moon, and askedif by any accident he had seen a palace with the laths of gold and thetiles of diamond and all the furniture of silver and gold.  Once thishouse belonged to him, but now it was stolen.  And the moon said no,but that the sun traveled farther than he did, and that the young manhad better go and ask him.So the young man departed and went away, away, away, as well as hishorse would take him, begging his living as he rode along, and somehowor other at last he got to the land of the sun.  There he found alittle old woman, who asked him:  "What are you doing here?  Go away.Have you not heard that my son feeds upon Christians?"  But he said noand that he would not go, for he was so miserable that it was all oneto him whether he died or not; that he had lost everything, andespecially a splendid palace like none other in the whole world, for ithad laths of gold and tiles of diamond and all the furniture was ofsilver and gold; and that he had sought it far and long, and in all theearth there was no man more unhappy.  So the old woman's heart meltedand she agreed to hide him.When the sun arrived he declared that he smelled Christian flesh and hemeant to have it for his dinner.  But his mother told him such apitiful story of the miserable wretch who had lost everything and hadcome from far to ask his help that at last he promised to see him.So the young man came out from his hiding-place and begged the sun totell him if in the course of his travels he had not seen somewhere apalace that had not its like in the whole world, for its laths were ofgold and its tiles of diamond and all the furniture in silver and gold.And the sun said no, but that perhaps the wind had seen it, for heentered everywhere and saw things that no one else ever saw, and ifanyone knew where it was it was certainly the wind.Then the poor young man again set forth as well as his horse could takehim, begging his living as he went, and somehow or other he ended byreaching the home of the wind.  He found there a little old womanbusily occupied in filling great barrels with water.  She asked himwhat had put it into his head to come there, for her son ate everythinghe saw, and that he would shortly arrive quite mad, and that the youngman had better look out.  But he answered that he was so unhappy thathe had ceased to mind anything, even being eaten, and then he told herthat he had been robbed of a palace that had not its equal in all theworld, and of all that was in it, and that he had even left his wifeand was wandering over the world until he found it.  And that it wasthe sun who had sent him to consult the wind.  So she hid him under thestaircase, and soon they heard the south wind arrive, shaking the houseto its foundations.  Thirsty as he was, he did not wait to drink, buthe told his mother that he smelled the blood of a Christian man, andthat she had better bring him out at once and make him ready to beeaten.  But she bade her son eat and drink what was before him, andsaid that the poor young man was much to be pitied, and that the sunhad granted him his life in order that he might consult the Wind.  Thenshe brought out the young man, who explained how he was seeking for hispalace, and that no man had been able to tell him where it was, so hehad come to the Wind.  And he added that he had been shamefully robbed,and that the laths were of gold and the tiles of diamond, and all thefurniture in silver and gold, and he inquired if the Wind had not seensuch a palace during his wanderings.And the Wind said yes, and that all that day he had been blowingbackward and forward over it without being able to move one singletile.  "Oh, do tell me where it is," cried the young man."  "It is along way off," replied the Wind, "on the other side of the Red Sea."But our traveler was not discouraged-he had already journeyed too far.So he set forth at once, and somehow or other he managed to reach thatdistant land.  And he inquired if any one wanted a gardener.  He wastold that the head gardener at the castle had just left, and perhaps hemight have a chance of getting the place.  The young man lost no time,but walked up to the castle and asked if they were in want of agardener; and how happy he was when they agreed to take him!  Now hepassed most of his day in gossiping with the servants about the wealthof their masters and the wonderful things in the house.  He madefriends with one of the maids, who told him the history of thesnuffbox, and he coaxed her to let him see it.  One evening she managedto get hold of it, and the young man watched carefully where she hid itaway in a secret place in the bedchamber of her mistress.The following night, when everyone was fast asleep, he crept in andtook the snuffbox.  Think of his joy as he opened the lid!  When itasked him, as of yore, "What do you want?"  he replied: "What do Iwant?  What do I want?  Why, I want to go with my palace to the oldplace, and for the king and the queen and all their servants to bedrowned in the Red Sea."He had hardly finished speaking when he found himself back again withhis wife, while all the other inhabitants of the palace were lying atthe bottom of the Red Sea.THE GOLDEN BLACKBIRDBy Paul SébillotONCE upon a time there was a great lord who had three sons.  He fellvery ill, sent for doctors of every kind, even bonesetters, but theynone of them could find out what was the matter with him or even givehim any relief.  At last there came a foreign doctor, who declared thatthe golden blackbird alone could cure the sick man.So the old lord dispatched his eldest son to look for the wonderfulbird, and promised him great riches if he managed to find it and bringit back.The young man began his journey and soon arrived at a place where fourroads met.  He did not know which to choose, and tossed his cap in theair, determining that the direction of its fall should decide him.After traveling for two or three days he grew tired of walking withoutknowing where or for how long, and .he stopped at an inn which wasfilled with merrymakers and ordered something to eat and drink."My faith," said he, "it is sheer folly to waste more time hunting forthis bird.  My father is old, and if he dies I shall inherit hisgoods."The old man, after waiting patiently for some time, sent his second sonto seek the golden blackbird.  The youth took the same direction as hisbrother, and when he came to the crossroads he too tossed up which roadhe should take.  The cap fell in the same place as before, and hewalked on till he came to the spot where his brother had halted.  Thelatter, who was leaning out of the window of the inn, called to him tostay where he was and amuse himself."You are right," replied the youth.  "Who knows if I should ever findthe golden blackbird, even if I sought the whole world through for it?At the worst, if the old man dies we shall have his property."He entered the inn and the two brothers made merry and feasted, tillvery soon their money was all spent.  They even owed something to theirlandlord, who kept them as hostages till they could pay their debts.The youngest son set forth in his turn, and he arrived at the placewhere his brothers where still prisoners.  They called to him to stopand did all they could to prevent his going further."No," he replied, "my father trusted me, and I will go all over theworld till I find the golden blackbird.""Bah," said his brothers, "you will never succeed any better than wedid.  Let him die if he wants to.  We will divide the property."As he went his way he met a little hare, who stopped to looked at himand asked:"Where are you going, my friend ?""I really don't quite know," answered he.  "My father is ill, and hecannot be cured unless I bring him back the golden blackbird.  It is along time since I set out, but no one can tell me where to find it.""Ah," said the hare, "you have a long way to go yet.  You will have towalk at least seven hundred miles before you get to it.""And how am I to travel such a distance?""Mount on my back," said the little hare, "and I will conduct you."The young man obeyed.  At each bound the little hare went seven miles,and it was not long before they reached a castle that was as large andbeautiful as a castle could be."The golden blackbird is in a little cabin near by," said the littlehare, "and you will easily find it.  It lives in a little cage, withanother cage beside it made all of gold.  But whatever you do, be surenot to put it in the beautiful cage, or everybody in the castle willknow that you have stolen it."The youth found the golden blackbird standing on a wooden perch, but asstiff and rigid as if he was dead.  And beside, was the beautiful cage,the cage of gold."Perhaps he would revive if I were to put him in that lovely cage,"thought the youth.The moment the golden blackbird had touched the bars of the splendidcage he awoke and began to whistle, so that all the servants of thecastle ran to see what was the matter, saying that he was a thief andmust be put in prison."No," he answered, "I am not a thief.  If I have taken the goldenblackbird, it is only that it may cure my father, who is ill, and Ihave traveled more than seven hundred miles in order to find it.""Well," they replied, "we will let you go, and will even give you thegolden blackbird if you are able to bring us the porcelain maiden."The youth departed, weeping, and met the little hare, who was munchingwild thyme."What are you crying for, my friend?"  asked the hare."It is because," he answered, "the castle people will not allow me tocarry off the golden blackbird without giving them the porcelain maidenin exchange.""You have not followed my advice," said the little hare.  "And you haveput the golden blackbird into the fine cage.""Alas!  yes!""Don't despair.  The porcelain maiden is a young girl, beautiful asVenus, who dwells two hundred miles from here.  Jump on my back and Iwill take you there."The little hare, who took seven miles in a stride, was there in no timeat all, and he stopped on the borders of a lake."The porcelain maiden," said the hare to the youth, "will come here tobathe with her friends.  Keep yourself out of sight behind the thicket,while I just eat a mouthful of thyme to refresh me.  When she is in thelake be sure you hide her clothes, which are of dazzling whiteness, anddo not give them back to her unless she consents to follow you."The little hare left him, and almost immediately the porcelain maidenarrived with her friends.  She undressed herself and got into thewater.  Then the young man glided up noiselessly and laid hold of herclothes, which he hid under a rock at some distance.When the porcelain maiden was tired of playing in the water she cameout to dress herself, but though she hunted for her clothes high andlow she could find them nowhere.  Her friends helped her in the search,but, seeing at last that it was of no use, they left her alone on thebank, weeping bitterly."Why do you cry?"  said the young man, approaching her."Alas!"  answered she, "while I was bathing some one stole my clothes,and my friends have abandoned me.""I will find your clothes if you will only come with me."And the porcelain maiden agreed to follow him, and after having givenup her clothes the young man bought a small horse for her which wentlike the wind.  The little hare brought them both back to seek for thegolden blackbird, and when they drew near the castle where it lived thelittle hare said to the young man:"Now, do be a little sharper than you were before, and you will manageto carry off both the golden blackbird and the porcelain maiden.  Takethe golden cage in one hand and leave the bird in the old cage where heis, and bring that away too."The little hare then vanished.  The youth did as he was bid, and thecastle servants never noticed that he was carrying off the goldenblackbird.  When he reached the inn where his brothers were detained hedelivered them by paying their debt.  They set out all together, but asthe two elder brothers were jealous of the success of the youngest,they took the opportunity as they were passing by the shores of a laketo throw themselves upon him, seize the golden blackbird, and fling himin the water.  Then they continued their journey, taking with them theporcelain maiden, in the firm belief that their brother was drowned.But happily he had snatched in falling at a tuft of rushes and calledloudly for help.  The little hare came running to him and said: "Takehold of my leg and pull yourself out of the water."When he was safe on shore the little hare said to him:"Now, this is what you have to do: dress yourself like a Breton seekinga place as stableboy, and go and offer your services to your father.Once there, you will easily be able to make him understand the truth."The young man did as the little hare bade him, and he went to hisfather's castle and inquired if they were not in want of a stableboy."Yes," replied his father, "very much indeed.  But it is not an easyplace.  There is a little horse in the stable which will not let anyonego near it, and it has already kicked to death several people who havetried to groom it.""I will undertake to groom it," said the youth.  "I never saw the horseI was afraid of yet."The little horse allowed itself to be rubbed down without a toss of itshead and without a kick."Good gracious!"  exclaimed the master.  "How is it that he lets youtouch him when no one else can go near him?""Perhaps he knows me," answered the stableboy.Two or three days later the master said to him: "The porcelain maidenis here; but though she is as lovely as the dawn, she is so wicked thatshe scratches every one that approaches her.  Try if she will acceptyour services."When the youth entered the room where she was the golden blackbirdbroke forth into a joyful song, and the porcelain maiden sang too andjumped for joy."Good gracious!"  cried the master."  The porcelain maiden and thegolden blackbird know you too?""Yes," replied the youth, "and the porcelain maiden can tell you thewhole truth if she only will."Then she told all that had happened, and how she had consented tofollow the young man who had captured the golden blackbird."Yes," added the youth, "I delivered my brothers, who were keptprisoners in an inn, and as a reward they threw me into a lake.  So Idisguised myself and came here in order to prove the truth to you.So the old lord embraced his son and promised that he should inheritall his possessions, and he put to death the two elder ones, who haddeceived him and had tried to slay their own brother.The young man married the porcelain maiden and had a splendid weddingfeastTHE HALF-CHICKRetold by Andrew LangONCE upon a time there was a handsome black Spanish hen who had a largebrood of chickens.  They were all fine, plump little birds except theyoungest, who was quite unlike his brothers and sisters.  Indeed, hewas such a strange, queer-looking creature that when he first clippedhis shell his mother could scarcely believe her eyes, he was sodifferent from the twelve other fluffy, downy, soft little chicks whonestled under her wings.  This one looked just as if he had been cut intwo.  He had only one leg, and one wing, and one eye, and he had half ahead and half a beak.  His mother shook her head sadly as she looked athim and said:"My youngest born is only a half-chick.  He can never grow up a tall,handsome cock like his brothers.  They will go out into the world andrule over poultry yards of their own; but this poor little fellow willalways have to stay at home with his mother."  And she called him MedioPollito, which is Spanish for half-chick.Now, though Medio Pollito was such an odd, helpless-looking littlething, his mother soon found that he was not at all willing to remainunder her wing and protection.  Indeed, in character he was as unlikehis brothers and sisters as he was in appearance.  They were good,obedient chickens, and when the old hen chicked after them they chirpedand ran back to her side.  But Medio Pollito had a roving spirit inspite of his one leg, and when his mother called to him to return tothe coop, he pretended that he could not hear, because he had only oneear.When she took the whole family out for a walk in the fields, MedioPollito would hop away by himself and hide among the corn.  Many ananxious minute his brothers and sisters had looking for him, while hismother ran to and fro cackling in fear and dismay.As he grew older he became more self-willed and disobedient, and hismanner to his mother was often very rude and his temper to the otherchickens very disagreeable.One day he had been out for a longer expedition than usual in thefields.  On his return he strutted up to his mother with the peculiarlittle hop and kick which was his way of walking, and cocking his oneeye at her in a very bold way, he said:"Mother, I am tired of this life in a dull f farmyard, with nothing buta dreary maize-field to look at.  I'm off to Madrid to see the king.""To Madrid, Medio Pollito!" exclaimed his mother.  "Why, you sillychick, it would be a long Journey for a grown-up cock, and a poorlittle thing like you would be tired out before you had gone half thedistance.  No, no, stay at home with your mother, and some day, whenyou are bigger, we will go a little journey together."But Medio Pollito had made up his mind, and he would not listen to hismother's advice nor to the prayers and entreaties of his brothers andsisters."What is the use of our all crowding each other up in this poky littleplace?"  he said.  "When I have a fine courtyard of my own at theking's palace, I shall perhaps ask some of you to come and pay me ashort visit."And scarcely waiting to say good-by to his family, away he stumped downthe high road that led to Madrid."Be sure that you are kind and civil to every one you meet," called hismother, running after him; but he was in such a hurry to be off that hedid not wait to answer her or even to look back.A little later in the day, as he was taking a short cut through afield, he passed a stream.  Now, the stream was all choked up andovergrown with weeds and water-plants, so that its waters could notflow freely."Oh!  Medio Pollito," it cried as the half-chick hopped along itsbanks, "do come and help me by clearing away these weeds.""Help you, indeed!" exclaimed Medio Pollito, tossing his head andshaking the few feathers in his tail.  "Do you think I have nothing todo but to waste my time on such trifles?  Help yourself and don'ttrouble busy travelers.  I am off to Madrid to see the king," andhoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, away stumped Medio Pollito.A little later he came to a fire that had been left by some gypsies ina wood.  It was burning very low and would soon be out."Oh!  Medio Pollito," cried the fire in a weak, wavering voice as thehalf-chick approached, "in a few minutes I shall go quite out unlessyou put some sticks and dry leaves upon me.  Do help me or I shalldie!""Help you, indeed!"  answered Medio Pollito.  "I have other things todo.  Gather sticks for yourself and don't trouble me.  I am off toMadrid to see the king," and hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, away stumpedMedio Pollito.The next morning, as he was getting near Madrid, he passed a largechestnut tree, in whose branches the wind was caught and entangled."Oh!  Medio Pollito," called the wind, "do hop up here and help me toget free of these branches.  I cannot come away and it is souncomfortable.""It is your own fault for going there," answered Medio Pollito.  "Ican't waste all my morning stopping here to help you.  Just shakeyourself off, and don't hinder me, for I am off to Madrid to see theking," and hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, away stumped Medio Pollito ingreat glee, for the towers and roofs of Madrid were now in sight.  Whenhe entered the town he saw before him a great, splendid house, withsoldiers standing before the gates.  This he knew must be the king'spalace, and he determined to hop up to the front gate and wait thereuntil the king came out.  But as he was hopping past one of the backwindows the king's cook saw him."Here is the very thing I want," he exclaimed, "for the king has justsent a message to say that he must have chicken broth for his dinner."Opening the window he stretched out his arm, caught Medio Pollito, andpopped him into the broth pot that was standing near the fire.  Oh!how wet and clammy the water felt as it went over Medio Pollito's head,making his feathers cling to him."Water!  water!" he cried in his despair, "do have pity upon me and donot wet me like this.""Ah! Medio Pollito," replied the water, "you would not help me when Iwas a little stream away on the fields.  Now you must be punished."Then the fire began to burn and scald Medio Pollito, and he danced andhopped from one side of the pot to the other, trying to get away fromthe heat and crying out in pain:"Fire!  fire!  do not scorch me like this; you can't think how ithurts.""Ah! Medio Pollito," answered the fire, "you would not help me when Iwas dying away in the wood.  You are being punished."At last, just when the pain was so great that Medio Pollito thought hemust die, the cook lifted up the lid of the pot to see if the broth wasready for the king's dinner."Look here!" he cried in horror, "this chicken is quite useless.  It isburned to a cinder.  I can't send it up to the royal table."  Andopening the window he threw Medio Pollito out in the street.  But thewind caught him up and whirled him through the air so quickly thatMedio Pollito could scarcely breathe, and his heart beat against hisside till he thought it would break."Oh, wind I" at last he gasped out, "if you hurry me along like thisyou will kill me.  Do let me rest a moment, or-"But he was so breathless that he could not finish his sentence."Ah! Medio Pollito," replied the wind, "when I was caught in thebranches of the chestnut tree you would not help me.  Now you arepunished."  And he swirled Medio Pollito over the roofs of the housestill they reached the highest church in the town, and there he left himfastened to the top of the steeple.And there stands Medio Pollito to this day.  And if you go to Madridand walk through the streets till you come to the highest church, youwill see Medio Pollito perched on his one leg on the steeple, with hisone wing drooping at his side and gazing sadly out of his one eye overthe town.THE THREE BROTHERSBy Hermann R. KletkeTHERE was once upon a time a witch who in the shape of a hawk usedevery night to break the windows of a certain village church.  In thesame village there lived three brothers, who were all determined tokill the mischievous hawk.  But in vain did the two eldest mount guardin the church with their guns; as soon as the bird appeared high abovetheir heads sleep overpowered them, and they only awoke to hear thewindows crashing in.Then the younger brother took his turn of guarding the windows, and toprevent his being overcome by sleep he placed a lot of thorns under hischin, so that if he felt drowsy and nodded his head they would prickhim and keep him awake.The moon was already risen and it was as light as day, when suddenly heheard a fearful noise, and at the same time a terrible desire to sleepoverpowered him.His eyelids closed and his head sank on his shoulders, but the thornsran into him and were so painful that he awoke at once.  He saw thehawk swooping down upon the church, and in a moment he had seized hisgun and shot at the bird.  The hawk fell heavily under a big stone,severely wounded in its right wing.  The youth ran to look at it andsaw that a huge abyss had opened below the stone.  He went at once tofetch his brothers, and with their help dragged a lot of pine wood andropes to the spot.  They fastened some of the burning pine wood to theend of the rope and let it slowly down to the bottom of the abyss.  Atfirst it was quite dark, and the flaming torch only lit up dirty graystone walls.  But the youngest brother determined to explore the abyss,and letting himself down by the rope he soon reached the bottom.  Herehe found a lovely meadow full of green trees and exquisite flowers.In the middle of the meadow stood a huge stone castle, with an irongate leading to it, which was wide open.  Everything in the castleseemed to be made of copper, and the only inhabitant he could discoverwas a lovely girl, who was combing her golden hair; and he noticed thatwhenever one of her hairs fell on the ground it rang out like puremetal.  The youth looked at her more closely, and saw that her skin wassmooth and fair, her blue eyes bright and sparkling, and her hair asgolden as the sun.  He fell in love with her on the spot, and kneelingat her feet he implored her to become his wife.The lovely girl accepted his proposal gladly; but at the same time shewarned him that she could never come up to the world above till hermother, the old witch, was dead.  And she went on to tell him that theonly way in which the old creature could be killed was with the swordthat hung up in the castle; but the sword was so heavy that no onecould lift it.Then the youth went into a room in the castle where everything was madeof silver, and here he found another beautiful girl, the sister of hisbride.  She was combing her silver hair, and every hair that fell onthe ground rang out like pure metal.  The second girl handed him thesword, but though he tried with all his strength he could not lift it.At last a third sister came to him and gave him a drop of something todrink, which she said would give him the needful strength.  He drankone drop, but still he could not lift the sword; then he drank a secondand the sword began to move; but only after he had drunk a third dropwas he able to swing the sword over his head.Then he hid himself in the castle and awaited the old witch's arrival.At last as it was beginning to grow dark she appeared.  She swoopeddown upon a big apple tree, and after shaking some golden apples fromit she pounced down upon the earth.  As soon as her feet touched theground she became transformed from a hawk into a woman.  This was themoment the youth was waiting for, and he swung his mighty sword in theair with all his strength and the witch's head fell off, and her bloodspurted upon the walls.Without fear of any further danger, he packed up all the treasures ofthe castle into great chests and gave his brothers a signal to pullthem up out of the abyss.  First the treasures were attached to therope and then the three lovely girls.  And now everything was up aboveand only he himself remained below.  But as he was a little suspiciousof his brothers, he fastened a heavy stone on to the rope and let thempull it up.  At first they heaved with a will, but when the stone washalfway up they let it drop suddenly, and it fell to the bottom brokeninto a hundred pieces."So that's what would have happened to my bones had I trusted myself tothem," said the youth sadly; and he cried bitterly, not because of thetreasures, but because of the lovely girl with her swanlike neck andgolden hair.For a long time he wandered sadly all through the beautiful underworld,and one day he met a magician who asked him the cause of his tears.The youth told him all that had befallen him, and the magician said:"Do not grieve, young man!  If you will guard the children who arehidden in the golden apple tree I will bring you at once up to theearth.  Another magician who lives in this land always eats my childrenup.  It is in vain that I have hidden them under the earth and lockedthem into the castle.  Now I have hidden them in the apple tree; hideyourself there, too, and at midnight you will see my enemy."The youth climbed up the tree and picked some of the beautiful goldenapples, which he ate for his supper.  At midnight the wind began torise and a rustling sound was heard at the foot of the tree.  The youthlooked down and beheld a long thick serpent beginning to crawl up thetree.  It wound itself round the stem and gradually got higher andhigher.  It stretched its huge head, in which the eyes glitteredfiercely, among the branches, searching for the nest in which thelittle children lay.  They trembled with terror when they saw thehideous creature and hid themselves beneath the leaves.Then the youth swung his mighty sword in the air, and with one blow cutoff the serpent's head.  He cut up the rest of the body into littlebits and strewed them to the four winds.The father of the rescued children was so delighted over the death ofhis enemy that he told the youth to get on his back, and thus hecarried him up to the world above.With what joy did he hurry now to his brothers' house!  He burst into aroom where they were all assembled, but no one knew who he was.  Onlyhis bride, who was serving as cook to her sisters, recognized her loverat once.His brothers, who had quite believed he was dead, yielded him up histreasures at once and flew into the woods in terror.  But the goodyouth forgave them all they had done and divided his treasures withthem.  Then he built himself a big castle with golden windows, andthere he lived happily with his golden-haired wife till the end oftheir lives.THE GLASS MOUNTAINBy Hermann R. KletkeONCE upon a time there was a glass mountain at the top of which stood acastle made of pure gold, and in front of the castle there grew anapple tree on which there were golden apples.Anyone who picked an apple gained admittance into the golden castle,and there in a silver room sat an enchanted princess of surpassingfairness and beauty.  She was as rich, too, as she was beautiful, forthe cellars of the castle were full of precious stones, and greatchests of the finest gold stood round the walls of all the rooms.Many knights had come from afar to try their luck, but it was in vainthey attempted to climb the mountain.  In spite of having their horsesshod with sharp nails, no one managed to get more than halfway up, andthen they all fell back right down to the bottom of the steep, slipperyhill.  Sometimes they broke an arm, sometimes a leg, and many a braveman had broken his neck even.The beautiful princess sat at her window and watched the bold knightstrying to reach her on their splendid horses.  The sight of her alwaysgave men fresh courage, and they flocked from the four quarters of theglobe to attempt the work of rescuing her.  But all in vain, and forseven years the princess had sat now and waited for some one to scalethe glass mountain.A heap of corpses both of riders and horses lay round the mountain, andmany dying men lay groaning there unable to go any further with theirwounded limbs.  The whole neighborhood had the appearance of a vastchurchyard.  In three more days the seven years would be at an end,when a knight in golden armor and mounted on a spirited steed was seenmaking his way toward the fatal hill.Sticking his spurs into his horse he made a rush at the mountain andgot up halfway, then he calmly turned his horse's head and came downagain without a slip or stumble.  The following day he started in thesame way; the horse trod on the glass as if it had been level earth,and sparks of fire flew from its hoofs.  All the other knights gazed inastonishment, for he had almost gained the summit, and in anothermoment he would have reached the apple tree; but of a sudden a hugeeagle rose up and spread its mighty wings, hitting as it did so theknight's horse in the eye.  The beast shied, opened its wide nostrils,and tossed its mane, then rearing high up in the air, its hind feetslipped and it fell with its rider down the steep mountain side.Nothing was left of either of them except their bones, which rattled inthe battered, golden armor like dry peas in a pod.And now there was only one more day before the close of the sevenyears.  Then there arrived on the scene a mere school boy-a merry,happy-hearted youth, but at the same time strong and well grown.  Hesaw how many knights had broken their necks in vain, but undaunted heapproached the steep mountain on foot and began the ascent.For long he had heard his parents speak of the beautiful princess whosat in the golden castle at the top of the glass mountain.  He listenedto all he heard and determined that he too would try his luck.  Butfirst he went to the forest and caught a lynx, and cutting off thecreature's sharp claws, he fastened them on to his own hands and feet.Armed with these weapons he boldly started up the glass mountain.  Thesun was nearly going down, and the youth had not got more than halfwayup.  He could hardly draw breath he was so worn out, and his mouth wasparched by thirst.  A huge black cloud passed over his head, but invain did he beg and beseech her to let a drop of water fall on him.  Heopened his mouth, but the black cloud sailed past and not as much as adrop of dew moistened his dry lips.His feet were torn and bleeding, and he could only hold on now with hishands.  Evening closed in, and he strained his eyes to see if he couldbehold the top of the mountain.  Then he gazed beneath him, and what asight met his eyes!  A yawning abyss, with certain and terrible deathat the bottom, reeking with half-decayed bodies of horses and riders!And this had been the end of all the other brave men who like himselfhad attempted the ascent.It was almost pitch dark now, and only the stars lit up the glassmountain.  The poor boy still clung on as if glued to the glass by hisblood-stained hands.  He made no struggle to get higher, for all hisstrength had left him, and seeing no hope he calmly awaited death.Then all of a sudden he fell into a deep sleep, and forgetful of hisdangerous position he slumbered sweetly.  But all the same, although heslept, he had stuck his sharp claws so firmly into the glass that hewas quite safe not to fall.Now, the golden apple tree was guarded by the eagle which hadoverthrown the golden knight and his horse.  Every night it flew roundthe glass mountain keeping a careful lookout, and no sooner had themoon emerged from the clouds than the bird rose up from the apple tree,and circling round in the air caught sight of the sleeping youth.Greedy for carrion, and sure that this must be a fresh corpse, the birdswooped down upon the boy.  But he was awake now, and perceiving theeagle, he determined by its help to save himself.The eagle dug its sharp claws into the tender flesh of the youth, buthe bore the pain without a sound and seized the bird's two feet withhis hands.  The creature in terror lifted him high up into the air andbegan to circle round the tower of the castle.  The youth held onbravely.  He saw the glittering palace, which by the pale rays of themoon looked like a dim lamp; and he saw the high windows, and round oneof them a balcony in which the beautiful princess sat lost in sadthoughts.  Then the boy saw that he was close to the apple tree, anddrawing a small knife from his belt he cut off both the eagle's feet.The bird rose up in the air in its agony and vanished into the clouds,and the youth fell on to the broad branches of the apple tree.Then he drew out the claws of the eagle's feet that had remained in hisflesh and put the peel of one of the golden apples on the wound, and inone moment it was healed and well again.  He pulled several of thebeautiful apples and put them in his pocket; then he entered thecastle.  The door was guarded by a great dragon, but as soon as hethrew an apple at it the beast vanished.At the same moment a gate opened, and the youth perceived a courtyardfull of flowers and beautiful trees, and on a balcony sat the lovelyenchanted princess with her retinue.As soon as she saw the youth she ran toward him and greeted him as herhusband and master.  She gave him all her treasures, and the youthbecame a rich and mighty ruler.  But he never returned to the earth,for only the mighty eagle, who had been the guardian of the princessand of the castle, could have carried on his wings the enormoustreasure down to the world.  But as the eagle had lost its feet, itdied, and its body was found in a wood on the glass mountain.One day when the youth was strolling about the palace garden with theprincess, his wife, he looked down over the edge of the glass mountainand saw to his astonishment a great number of people gathered there.He blew his silver whistle, and the swallow who acted as messenger inthe golden castle flew past."Fly down and ask what the matter is," he said to the little bird, whosped off like lightning and soon returned saying:"The blood of the eagle has restored all the people below to life.  Allthose who have perished on this mountain are awakening up to-day, as itwere from a sleep, and are mounting their horses, and the wholepopulation are gazing on this unheard-of wonder with joy andamazement."HUNTSMAN THE UNLUCKYBy John T. NaakéONCE upon a time there lived a huntsman.  He would go every day insearch of game, but it often happened that he killed nothing, and sowas obliged to return home with his bag empty.  On that account he wasnicknamed "Huntsman the Unlucky."  At last he was reduced by his illfortune to such extremities that he had not a piece of bread nor akopek left.  The wretched man wandered about the forest, cold andhungry; he had eaten nothing for three days, and was nearly dying ofstarvation.  He lay down on the grass determined to put an end to hisexistence; happily better thoughts came into his mind; he crossedhimself, and threw away the gun.  Suddenly he heard a rustling noisenear him.  It seemed to issue from some thick grass close at hand.  Thehunter got up and approached the spot.  He then observed that the grasspartly hid a gloomy abyss, from the bottom of which there rose a stone,and on it lay a small jar.  As he looked and listened the hunter hearda small voice crying-"Dear, kind traveler, release me!"The voice seemed to proceed from the little jar.  The courageoushunter, walking carefully from one stone to another, approached thespot where the jar lay, took it up gently, and heard a voice cryingfrom within like the chirping of a grasshopper-"Release me, and I will be of service to you.""Who are you, my little friend?" asked Huntsman the Unlucky."I have no name, and cannot be seen by human eyes," answered a softvoice.  "If you want me, call 'Murza!'  A wicked magician put me inthis jar, sealed it with the seal of King Solomon, and then threw meinto this fearful place, where I have lain for seventy years.""Very good," said Huntsman the Unlucky; "I will give you your liberty,and then we shall see how you will keep your word."  He broke the sealand opened the little jar-there was nothing in it!"Halloa!  where are you, my friend?" cried the hunter."By your side," a voice answered.The hunter looked about him, but could see no one."Murza!""Ready!  I await your orders.  I am your servant for the next threedays, and will do whatever you desire.  You have only to say, 'Gothere, I know not where; bring something, I know not what.'""Very well," said the hunter.  "'You will doubtless know best what iswanted: Go there, I know not where; bring something, I know not what."As soon as the hunter had uttered these words there appeared before hima table covered with dishes, each filled with the most deliciousviands, as if they had come direct from a banquet of the czar.  Thehunter sat down at the table, and ate and drank till he was satisfied.He then rose, crossed himself, and, bowing on all sides, exclaimed-"Thank you!  thank you!"Instantly the table, and everything else with it, disappeared, and thehunter continued his journey.After walking some distance he sat down by the roadside to rest.  It sohappened that while the hunter was resting himself, there passedthrough the forest a gypsy thief, leading a horse which he wanted tosell."I wish I had the money to buy the horse with," thought the hunter;"what a pity my pockets are empty!  However, I will ask my invisiblefriend.  Murza!""Ready!""Go there, I know not where; bring something, I know not what."In less than a minute the hunter heard the money chinking in hispocket; gold poured into them, he knew not how nor whence."Thanks!  you have kept your word," said the hunter.He then began to bargain with the gypsy for the horse.  Having agreedupon the price, he paid the man in gold, who, staring at the hunterwith his mouth wide open, wondered where Huntsman the Unlucky had gotso much money from.  Parting from the hunter, the gypsy thief ran withall his speed to the farther end of the forest, and whistled.  Therewas no answer.  "They are asleep," thought the gypsy, and entered acavern where some robbers, lying on the skins of animals, were restingthemselves."Halloa, comrades!  Are you asleep?" cried the gypsy.  "Get up, quick!or you will lose a fine bird.  He is alone in the forest, and hispockets are full of gold.  Make haste!"The robbers sprang up, mounted their horses, and galloped after thehunter.The hunter heard the clatter, and seeing himself suddenly surrounded byrobbers, cried out- "Murza!""Ready!"  answered a voice near him.  "Go there, I know not where;bring something, I know not what."There was a rustling noise heard in the forest, and then something frombehind the trees fell upon the robbers.  They were knocked from theirhorses, and scattered on all sides; yet no hand was seen to touch them.The robbers, thrown upon the ground, could not raise themselves, andthe hunter, thankful and rejoicing at his deliverance, rode on, andsoon found his way out of the dark forest, and came upon a town.Near this town there were pitched tents full of soldiers.  Huntsman theUnlucky was told that an enormous army of Tartars had come, under thecommand of their khan, who, angry at being refused the hand of thebeautiful Princess Milovzora, the daughter of the czar, had declaredwar against him.  The hunter had seen the Princess Milovzora when shewas out hunting in the forest.  She used to ride a beautiful horse, andcarry a golden lance in her hand; a magnificent quiver of arrows hungfrom her shoulder.  When her veil was lifted up she appeared like thespring sunlight, to give light to the eyes and warmth to the heart.The hunter reflected for a little while, and then cried, "Murza!"In an instant he found himself dressed in splendid attire; his jacketwas embroidered with gold, he wore a beautiful mantle on his shoulders,and ostrich feathers hung gracefully down from the top of his helmet,fastened by a brooch of a ruby surrounded by pearls.  The hunter wentinto the castle, presented himself before the czar, and offered todrive away the forces of the enemy on condition that the czar gave himthe beautiful Princess Milovzora for his wife.The czar was greatly surprised, but did not like to refuse such anoffer at once; he first asked the hunter his name, his birth and hispossessions."I am called Huntsman the Unlucky, Master of Murza the Invisible."The czar thought the young stranger was mad; the courtiers, however,who had seen him before, assured the czar that the stranger exactlyresembled Huntsman the Unlucky, whom they knew; but how he had got thatsplendid dress they could not tell.Then the czar demanded:"Do you hear what they say?  If you are telling lies, you will loseyour head.  Let us see, then, how you will overcome the enemy with theforces of your invisible Murza?""Be of good hope, czar," answered the hunter; "as soon as I say theword, everything will be completed.""Good," said the czar.  "If you have spoken the truth you shall have mydaughter for your wife; if not, your head will be the forfeit."The hunter said to himself, "I shall either become a prince, or I am alost man."He then whispered, "Murza, go there, I know not where; do this, I knownot what."A few minutes passed, and there was nothing to be heard or seen.Huntsman the Unlucky turned pale; the czar, enraged, ordered him to beseized and put in irons, when suddenly the firing of guns was heard inthe distance.  The czar and his courtiers ran out on the steps leadingto the castle, and saw bodies of men approaching from both right andleft, their standards waving gracefully in the air; the soldiers weresplendidly equipped.  The czar could hardly believe his eyes, for hehimself had no troops so fine as these."This is no delusion!" cried Huntsman the Unlucky.  "These are theforces of my invisible friend.""Let them drive away the enemy then, if they can," said the czar.The hunter waved his handkerchief.  The army wheeled into position;music burst forth in a martial strain, and then a great cloud of dustarose.  When the dust had cleared away, the army was gone.The czar invited Huntsman the Unlucky to dinner, and asked him numerousquestions about Murza the Invisible.  At the second course the newscame that the enemy was flying in every direction, completely routed.The terrified Tartars had left all their tents and baggage behind them.The czar thanked the hunter for his assistance, and informed hisdaughter that he had found a husband for her.  Princess Milovzorablushed upon receiving this intelligence, then turned pale, and beganto shed tears.  The hunter whispered something to Murza, and theprincess's tears changed into precious stones as they fell.  Thecourtiers hastened to pick them up-they were pearls and diamonds.  Theprincess smiled at this, and overcome with pleasure gave her hand toHuntsman the Unlucky-unlucky no longer.  Then began the feast.  Buthere the story must end.STORY OF LITTLE SIMPLETONBy John T. NaakéONCE there lived a peasant and his wife who had three daughters.  Thetwo elder girls were cunning and selfish; the youngest was simple andopen-hearted, and on that account came to be called, first by hersisters and afterward by her father and mother, "Little Simpleton."Little Simpleton was pushed about, had to fetch everything that waswanted, and was always kept at work; but she was ever ready to do whatshe was told, and never uttered a word of complaint.  She would waterthe garden, prepare pine splinters, milk the cows, and feed the ducks;she had to wait upon everybody-in a word, she was the drudge of thefamily.One day, as the peasant was going with the hay to market, he asked hisdaughters what they would like him to buy for them."Buy me some kumach (Red wool stuff from Bucharest) for a sarafan (Along dress worn by the Russian peasant women) father," answered theeldest daughter."And me some nankeen," said the second.  The youngest daughter alonedid not ask for a present.  The peasant was moved with compassion forthe girl; although a simpleton she was still his daughter.Turning to her he asked "Well, Little Simpleton, what shall I buy foryou?"Little Simpleton smiled and replied-"Buy me, dearest father, a little silver plate and a little apple.""What do you want them for?" asked her sisters."I will make the little apple roll round the plate, and will say somewords to it which an old woman taught me because I gave her a cake."The peasant promised to buy his daughters what they asked of him, andthen started for market.  He sold his hay, and bought the presents:some nankeen for one of his daughters, for another some kumach, and forLittle Simpleton a little silver plate and a little apple.  Then hereturned home and gave these things to his daughters.The girls were delighted; the two elder ones made themselves sarafans,and laughed at Little Simpleton, wondering what she would do with thesilver plate and the apple.Little Simpleton did not eat the apple, but sat down in a corner andcried-"Roll, roll, little apple on the silver plate, and show me towns andfields, forests and seas, lofty mountains and beautiful skies."And the apple began to roll on the plate, and there appeared on it townafter town; ships sailing on the seas, and people in the fields;mountains and beautiful skies; suns and stars.  All these things lookedso beautiful, and were so wonderful, that it would be impossible totell of them in a story, or describe them with the pen.At first the elder sisters looked at the little plate with delight;soon, however, their hearts were filled with envy, and they began totry to get it from their younger sister.  But the girl would not partwith it on any account.  Then the wicked girls said- "Dearest sister,let us go into the forest to gather blackberries."Little Simpleton got up, gave the plate and apple to her father, andwent with them into the forest.  They walked about and gatheredblackberries.  All at once they saw a spade lying upon the ground.  Thewicked sisters killed Little Simpleton with it, and buried her under abirch tree.They returned home late, and told their father, "The Simpleton is lost;she ran away from us in the forest; we searched, but could not find heranywhere.  The wolves must have eaten her."The peasant regretted the loss of his daughter bitterly; for althoughso simple she was still his child.  The wicked sisters also shed tears.Her father put the little silver plate and the little apple into a box,and locked them up.Next morning a shepherd was tending his sheep near the place, playingon his pipe, and searching in the forest for one of his flock that wasmissing.  He observed the little grave under the birch tree; it wascovered by the most lovely flowers, and out of the middle of the gravethere grew a reed.  The shepherd cut off the reed, and made a pipe ofit.  As soon as the pipe was prepared, oh, wonderful!  It began to playof itself, and say-"Play, oh pipe, play!  and comfort my poor parents and sisters.  I waskilled for the sake of my little silver plate and my little apple."When the people heard of this they ran out of their huts, and all cameround the shepherd and began to ask him who was killed."Good people," answered the shepherd, "I don't know who it is.  Whilesearching for one of my sheep in the forest, I came upon a gravecovered with flowers.  Above them all stood a reed.  I cut off the reedand made this pipe of it.  It plays of itself, and you have heard whatit says."The father of Little Simpleton happened to be present.  He took thepipe into his own hand, and it began to play:"Play, oh pipe, play!  Comfort my poor father and mother.  I was killedfor the sake of my little silver plate and my little apple."  Thepeasant asked the shepherd to take him to the place where he had cutthe reed.  They all went into the forest, saw the grave, and wereastonished at the sight of the lovely flowers which grew there.  Theyopened the grave, and there discovered the body of a girl, which thepoor man recognized as that of his youngest daughter.  There she lay,murdered-but by whom no one could tell.  The people asked one anotherwho it was that had killed the poor girl.  Suddenly the pipe began toplay-"Oh, my dearest father; my sisters brought me to this forest, and herekilled me for the sake of my little plate and my little apple.  Youwill not bring me to life until you fetch some of the water from theczar's well."Then the wicked sisters confessed it all.  They were seized and castinto a dark prison, to await the pleasure of the czar.  The peasant setout for the capital.  As soon as he arrived at the city, he went to thepalace, saw the czar, told his story, and begged permission to takesome water from the well.  The czar said, "You may take some water oflife from my well, and as soon as you have restored your daughter tolife, bring her here with her little plate and the little apple; bringyour other two daughters also."The peasant bowed to the ground, and returned home with a bottle fullof the water of life.  He hastened to the grave in the forest, liftedup the body of his daughter, and as soon as he had sprinkled it withthe water the girl came to life again, and threw herself into his arms.All who were present were moved to tears.Then the peasant started again for the capital, and arriving there wentat once to the czar's palace.  The czar came out, and saw the peasantwith his three daughters, two of them with their arms bound, the third,as beautiful as the spring flowers, stood near, the tears like diamondsfalling down her cheeks.  The czar was very angry with the two wickedsisters; then he asked the youngest for her little plate and apple.The girl took the box from her father's hands, and said-"Sire, what would you like to see?  Your towns or your armies; theships at sea, or the beautiful stars in the sky?"Then she made the little apple roll round the plate, and there appearedon it many towns, one after the other, with bodies of soldiers nearthem, with their standards and artillery.  Then the soldiers made readyfor the fight, and the officers stood in their places.  The firingcommenced, the smoke arose, and hid it all from view.  The little applebegan again to roll on the plate, and there appeared the sea coveredwith ships, their flags streaming in the wind.  The guns began to fire,the smoke arose, and again all disappeared from their sight.  The appleagain began to roll on the plate, and there appeared on it thebeautiful sky with suns and stars.The czar was astonished.  The girl fell down on her knees before him,and cried-"Oh, Sire, take my little plate and my little apple, and forgive mysisters!"The czar was moved by her tears and entreaties and forgave the wickedsisters; the delighted girl sprang up and began to embrace and kissthem.  The czar smiled, took her by the hand and said, "I honor thegoodness of your heart, and admire your beauty.  Would you like tobecome my wife?""Sire," answered the beautiful girl, "I obey your royal command; butallow me first to ask my parents' permission."The delighted peasant at once gave his consent; they sent for themother, and she, too, gladly bestowed her blessing."One favor more," said the beautiful girl to the czar.  "Permit myparents and sisters to remain with me."On hearing this the sisters fell down on their knees before her, andcried-"We are not worthy of so much favor!""Dearest sisters," said the beautiful girl, "all is forgotten andforgiven.  They who remember the past with malice deserve to lose theirsight."She then tried to lift them up from the ground, but they, sheddingbitter tears, would not rise.  Then the czar, looking at them with afrown, bade them get up; he allowed them, however, to stay in thepalace.A magnificent entertainment then began: the palace was splendidlylighted up, and looked like the sun among the clouds.  The czar andczarina rode out in an open chariot and showed themselves to thepeople, who cried joyfully-"Long live czar and czarina!  May they shine upon us like the glorioussun for years and years to come!"THE GOLDEN FISHBy L. M. GaskUPON a certain island in the middle of the sea dwelt an old man and hiswife.  They were so poor that they often went short of bread, for thefish he caught were their only means of livelihood.One day when the man had been fishing for many hours without success,he hooked a small Gold Fish, whose eyes were bright as diamonds."Let me go, kind man," the little creature cried.  "I should not make amouthful either for yourself or your wife, and my own mate waits for medown in the waters."The old man was so moved by his pleadings that he took him off the hookand threw him back into the sea.  Before he swam off to rejoin hismate, the Gold Fish promised that in return for his kindness he wouldcome to the fisherman's help if ever he wanted him.  Laughing merrilyat this, for he did not believe that a fish could help him except byproviding him with food, the old man went home and told his wife."What!" she cried, "you actually let him go when you had caught him?It was just like your stupidity.  We have not a scrap of bread in thehouse, and now, I suppose, we must starve!"Her reproaches continued for so long that though he scarcely believedwhat the fish had said, the poor old man thought that at least it woulddo no harm to put him to the test.  He therefore hastened back to theshore, and stood at the very edge of the waves."Golden Fish, Golden Fish!" he called.  "Come to me, I pray, with yourtail in the water, and your head lifted up toward me!"As the last word was uttered the Gold Fish popped up his head."You see I have kept my promise," he said.  "What can I do for you, mygood friend?""There is not a scrap of bread in the house," quavered the old man,"and my wife is very angry with me for letting you go."Don't trouble about that!" said the Gold Fish in an off-hand manner;"you will find bread, and to spare, when you go home."  And the old manhurried away to see if his little friend had spoken truly.Surely enough, he found that the pan was full of fine white loaves."I did not do so badly for you after all, good wife!"  he said, as theyate their supper; but his wife was anything but satisfied.  The moreshe had, the more she wanted, and she lay awake planning what theyshould demand from the Gold Fish next."Wake up, you lazy man!" she cried to her husband, early next morning."Go down to the sea and tell your fish that I must have a new washtub."The old man did as his wife bade him, and the moment he called the GoldFish reappeared.  He seemed quite willing to grant the new request, andon his return home the old man found a beautiful new washtub in thesmall yard at the back of their cabin."Why didn't you ask for a new cabin too?"  his wife said angrily.  "Ifyou had had a grain of sense you would have done this without beingtold.  Go back at once, and say that we must have one.The old man was rather ashamed to trouble his friend again so soon; butthe Gold Fish was as obliging as ever."Very well," he said, "a new cabin you shall have."  And the old martfound one so spick-and-span that he hardly dare cross the floor forfear of soiling it.  It would have pleased him greatly had his wifebeen contented, but she, good woman, did nothing but grumble still."Tell your Gold Fish," she said next day, "that I want to be a duchess,with many servants at my beck and call, and a splendid carriage todrive in.Once more her wish was granted, but now her husband's plight was hardindeed.  She would not let him share her palace, but ordered him off tothe stables, where he was forced to keep company with her grooms.  In afew days, however, he grew reconciled to his lot, for here he couldlive in peace, while he learned that she was leading those around her aterrible life, it was not long before she sent for him again."Summon the Gold Fish," she commanded haughtily, "and tell him I wishto be Queen of the Waters, and to rule over all the fish."The poor old man felt sorry for the fish if they had to be under herrule, for prosperity had quite spoiled her.  However, he dared notdisobey, and once more summoned his powerful friend."Make your wife the Queen of the Waters?" exclaimed the Gold Fish."That is the last thing I should do.  She is unfit to reign, for shecannot rule herself or her desires.  I shall make her once more a poorold woman.  Adieu!  You will see me no more."The old man returned sorrowfully with this unpleasant message, to findthe palace transformed into a humble cabin, and his wife in a skirt ofthreadbare stuff in place of the rich brocade which she had worn oflate.  She was sad and humble, and much more easy to live with than shehad been before.  Her husband therefore had occasion many times tothink gratefully of the Gold Fish, and sometimes when drawing up hisnet the glint of the sun upon the scales of his captives would give hima moment's hope-which, alas!  was as often disappointed-that once againhe was to see his benefactor.THE WONDERFUL HAIRBy W. S. KarajichTHERE once lived a man who was very poor, and who had many children; somany that he was unable to support them.  As he could not endure theidea of their perishing of hunger, he was often tempted to destroythem; his wife alone prevented him.  One night, as he lay asleep, thereappeared to him a lovely child in a vision.  The child said-"Oh, man!  I see your soul is in danger, in the thought of killing yourhelpless children.  But I know you are poor, and am come here to helpyou.  You will find under your pillow in the morning a looking-glass, ared handkerchief, and an embroidered scarf.  Take these three things,but show them to no one, and go to the forest.  In that forest you willfind a rivulet.  Walk by the side of this rivulet until you come to itssource; there you will see a girl, as bright as the sun, with long hairstreaming down her shoulders.  Take care that she does you no harm.Say not a word to her; for if you utter a single syllable, she willchange you into a fish or some other creature, and eat you.  Should sheask you to comb her hair, obey her.  As you comb it, you will find onehair as red as blood; pull it out, and run away with it.  Be swift, forshe will follow you.  Then throw on the ground, first the embroideredscarf, then the red handkerchief, and last of all the looking-glass;they will delay her pursuit of you.  Sell the hair to some rich man;but see that you do not allow yourself to be cheated, for it is ofboundless worth.  Its produce will make you rich and thus you will beable to feed your children."Next morning, when the poor man awoke, he found under his pillowexactly the things the child mad told him of in his dream.  He wentimmediately into the forest, and when he had discovered the rivulet hewalked by the side of it, on and on, until he reached its source.There he saw a girl sitting on the bank, threading a needle with therays of the sun.  She was embroidering a net made of the hair ofheroes, spread on a frame before her.  He approached and bowed to her.The girl got up and demanded-"Where did you come from, strange knight?"The man remained silent.  Again she asked him-"Who are you, and why do you come here?"  And many other questions.But he remained silent as a stone, indicating with his hands only thathe was dumb and in need of help.  She told him to sit at her feet, andwhen he had gladly done so, she inclined her head toward him, that hemight comb her hair.  He began to arrange her hair as if to comb it,but as soon as he had found the red one, he separated it from the rest,plucked it out, leaped up, and ran from her with his utmost speed.The girl sprang after him, and was soon at his heels.  The man, turninground as he ran, and seeing that his pursuer would soon overtake him,threw the embroidered scarf on the ground, as he had been told.  Whenthe girl saw it, she stopped and began to examine it; turning it overon both sides, and admiring the embroidery.  Meanwhile the man gained aconsiderable distance in advance.  The girl tied the scarf round herbosom and recommenced the pursuit.  When the man saw that she was againabout to overtake him, he threw down the red handkerchief.  At thesight of it, the girl again stopped, examined, and wondered at it; thepeasant, in the meantime, was again enabled to increase the distancebetween them.  When the girl perceived this, she became furious, andthrowing away both scarf and handkerchief began to run with increasedspeed after him.  She was just upon the point of catching the poorpeasant, when he threw the looking-glass at her feet.  At the sight ofthe looking-glass, the like of which she had never seen before, thegirl checked herself, picked it up, and looked in it.  Seeing her ownface, she fancied there was another girl looking at her.  While she wasthus occupied the man ran so far that she could not possibly overtakehim.  When the girl saw that further pursuit was useless, she turnedback, and the peasant, joyful and unhurt, reached his home.  Oncewithin doors he showed the hair to his wife and children, and told themall that had happened to him; but his wife only laughed at the Story.The peasant, however, took no heed of her ridicule, but went to aneighboring town to sell the hair.  He was soon surrounded by a crowdof people, and some merchants began to bid for his prize.  One merchantoffered him one gold piece, another two, for the single hair, and soon, until the price rose to a hundred gold pieces.  Meanwhile the king,hearing of the wonderful red hair, ordered the peasant to be called in,and offered him a thousand gold pieces for it.  The man joyfully soldit for that sum.What wonderful kind of hair was this after all?  The king split itcarefully open from end to end, and in it was found the story of manymarvelous secrets of nature, and of things that had happened since thecreation of the world.Thus the peasant became rich, and henceforth lived happily with hiswife and children.  The child he had seen in his dream, was an angelsent down from heaven to succor him, and to reveal to mankind theknowledge of many wonderful things which had hitherto remainedunexplained.THE LANGUAGE OF ANIMALSBy W. S. KarajichA CERTAIN man had a shepherd who had served him faithfully and honestlyfor many years.  One day, as the Shepherd was tending his sheep, heheard a hissing noise in the forest, and wondered what it could he.  Hewent, therefore, into the wood in the direction of the sound, to learnwhat it was.  There he saw that the dry grass and leaves had caughtfire, and in the middle of a burning circle a Snake was hissing.  TheShepherd stopped to see what the Snake would do, for the fire wasburning all around it, and the flames approached it nearer and nearerevery moment.  Then the Snake cried from amid the fire-"Oh, Shepherd!  for heaven's sake save me from this fire!"The Shepherd stretched out his crook over the flames to the Snake, andthe Snake passed along it on to his hand, and from his hand it crawledto his neck, where it twisted itself round.When the Shepherd perceived this, he was greatly alarmed, and said tothe Snake-"What have I done in an evil hour?  Have I saved you to my owndestruction?"The Snake answered him, "Fear not, but carry me to my father's house.My father is the King of the snakes."The Shepherd, however, began to beg the Snake to excuse him, sayingthat he could not leave the sheep; but the Snake answered-"Be not troubled about the sheep; no harm shall happen to them; only goas fast as you can."The Shepherd then walked through the forest with the Snake until hecame to a gate which was entirely made of snakes knotted together.There the Snake on the Shepherd's neck gave a whistle, and all theother snakes untwisted themselves.  Then the Snake said to theShepherd-"When we come to my father's palace he will give you whatever you askfor: silver, gold, and precious stones.  Do you, however, take nothingof these, but beg to know the language of the brutes and othercreatures.  He will refuse you this for a long time, but at last hewill grant your request."Meanwhile they came to the palace, to the father, who, shedding manytears, cried-"For heaven's sake!  my dearest daughter, where have you been?"And she told him in due order how she had been surrounded by the forestfire, and how the Shepherd had rescued her.  Then the King of thesnakes turned to the Shepherd and said to him-"What would you have me give you for the deliverance of my daughter?"The Shepherd answered, "Only let me understand the language of animals;I want nothing else."Then the King said, "That is not good for you; for if I were to bestowupon you the gift of the knowledge of the tongue of animals, and youwere to tell anyone of it, you would instantly die.  Ask, therefore,for something else; whatever you desire to possess, I will give toyou."To which the Shepherd replied-"If you wish to give me anything, then grant me the knowledge of thelanguage of brute creatures; but if you do not care to give me that-farewell, and God protect you!  I want nothing else."  And the Shepherdturned to leave the place.Then the King called him back, saying-"Stay!  come here to me, since you will have it at all hazards.  Openyour mouth."The Shepherd opened his mouth, and the King of the snakes breathed intoit, and said-"Do you now breathe into my mouth."The Shepherd breathed into his mouth, and the Snake King breathed againinto that of the Shepherd.  After they had breathed each three timesinto the other's mouth, the King said-"Now you understand the language of animals, and of all created things.Go in peace, and God be with you!  but for the life of you, tell no oneof this; if you do, you will die on the instant!"The Shepherd returned home through the forest.  As he walked he heardand understood all that the birds said, and the grass and all the otherthings that are upon the earth.  When he came to his sheep and foundthem all together and quite safe, he laid himself down to rest.Scarcely had he lain down when there flew two ravens toward him, whotook their perch upon a tree, and began to talk together in their ownlanguage."What if that Shepherd only knew that underneath the place where theblack lamb lies there is a cellar full of silver and gold!'When the Shepherd heard this, he went to his master, and told him ofit.  The master took a cart with him, and they dug down to a doorleading to the cave, and removed the treasure to his house.  But themaster was an honest man, and gave all the treasure to the Shepherd,saying-"My son, all this treasure is yours, for heaven has given it to you.Buy yourself a house with it, marry, and live happily in it."The Shepherd took the treasure, built himself a house, and, havingmarried, lived a happy life.  Soon he became known as the richest man,not only in his own village, but so rich that there was not his equalin the whole neighborhood.  He had his own shepherd, cow keeper,hostler, and swineherd; plenty of goods and chattels, and great riches.One day, just before Christmas, he said to his wife, "Get some wine,and some brandy, and all things necessary; to-morrow we will go to thefarmyard and take the good things to the shepherds that they may alsoenjoy themselves."The wife followed his directions and prepared all that he had told her.When they arrived on the following day at the farmhouse, the mastersaid to the shepherds in the evening--"Come here, all of you; eat, drink, and be merry.  I will watch overthe flocks for you to-night."  And he went, in very deed, and remainedwith the flocks.About midnight the wolves began to howl and the dogs to bark, and thewolves said in their language-"May we come in and do what mischief we like?  Then you, too, shallhave your share."And the dogs answered in their language, "Come in; and we will eat ourfill with you."But among the dogs there was an old one, who had but two teeth in hishead, and he said to the wolves-"That will not do.  So long as I have my two teeth in my head you shalldo no harm to my master nor his."The master heard it all, and understood what was said.  On thefollowing morning he ordered all the dogs to be killed save only theold one.  The hinds said, "Heaven forbid, sir; that would be a greatpity!"  But the master answered, "Do what I have told you."Then he prepared to return home with his wife, and they both mountedtheir horses.  And as they rode on, the husband got a little ahead,while the wife fell behind.  At last the husband's horse neighed, andcalled to the mare-"Come on!  make haste!  Why do you lag behind!"And the mare answered him, "Ah yes, it is all very easy for you: youhave only one to carry, the master; while I have to carry two, themistress and her baby."The husband turned round and laughed, and his wife seeing this, urgedthe mare forward, overtook her husband, and asked him what he had beenlaughing at."Nothing; I do not know; just something that came into my mind,"answered the husband.But the wife was not satisfied with this answer, and she pressed himagain and again to tell her why he had laughed.But he excused himself, and said-"Let me alone, wife!  What is the matter with you?  I do not knowmyself why I laughed."But the more he denied her the more she insisted upon his telling herwhat he had been laughing at.  At last the husband said to her-"Know then, that if I tell you the reason, I shall instantly die."The woman, however, did not care for that, but urged him to tell hernotwithstanding.Meanwhile they had reached home.  The husband ordered a coffin to bemade immediately, and when it was ready he had it placed before thehouse, and said to his wife-"See now, I now lay me down in this coffin, and then tell you why Ilaughed; but as soon as I have told you I shall die."The husband lay down in the coffin, and looked around him for the lasttime.  And there came the old Dog from the farmyard, and sat down athis head and whined.  The husband seeing this, said to his wife-"Bring a piece of bread and give it to this Dog."The wife brought out a piece of bread, and threw it down to the Dog;but the Dog would not even look at it.  Then the House Cock ran up, andbegan to pick at the bread; and the Dog said to it-"You miserable greedy thing, you!  You can eat, and yet you see thatthe master is going to die!"The Cock answered the Dog, "And let him die since he is such a fool.  Ihave a hundred wives, and I call them all together whenever I find agrain of corn, and as soon as they have come round me, I swallow itmyself.  And if any one of them got angry, I should be at her directlywith my beak.  The master has only one wife, and he cannot even manageher."When the husband heard this he quickly sprang out of the coffin, tookup a stick, and called his wife into the room."Come, wife," he said, "I will tell you what you so much want to hear."Then as he beat her with the stick he cried, "This is it, wife!  Thisis it."In this way he quieted his wife, and she never asked him again what hehad been laughing at.THE EMPEROR TROJAN'S GOAT'S EARSBy W. S. KarajichTHERE once lived an emperor whose name was Trojan.  This emperor hadgoat's ears, and he used to call in barber after barber to shave him.But whoever went in never came out again; for while the barber wasshaving him, the emperor would ask what he observed uncommon in him,and when the barber would answer that he observed his goat's ears, theEmperor would immediately cut him into pieces.At last it came to the turn of a certain barber to go who feignedillness, and sent his apprentice instead.  When the apprentice appearedbefore the emperor he was asked why his master did not come, and heanswered, "Because he is ill."  Then the emperor sat down, and allowedthe youth to shave him.As he shaved him the apprentice noticed the emperor's goat's ears, butwhen Trojan asked him what he had observed, he answered, "I haveobserved nothing."Then the emperor gave him twelve ducats, and said to him-"From this time forth you shall always come and shave me.When the apprentice came home, his master asked him how he got on atthe emperor's, and the youth answered--"All well; and the emperor has told me that I am to shave him infuture."Then he showed the twelve ducats he had received; but as to theemperor's goat's ears, of that he said nothing.>From this time forth the apprentice went regularly to Trojan to shavehim, and for each shaving he received twelve ducats; but he told no onethat the emperor had goat's ears.At last it began to worry and torment him that he dare tell no one hissecret; and he became sick and began to pine away.  His master, whocould not fail to observe this, asked him what ailed him, and aftermuch pressing the apprentice confessed that he had something on hisheart which he dared not confide to anyone, and he added, "If I couldonly tell it to somebody, I should feel better at once."Then said the master-"Tell it to me, and I will faithfully keep it from everybody else; orif you fear to trust me with it, then go to the confessor and confideit to him; but if you will not do even that, then go into the fieldsoutside the town, there dig a hole, thrust your head into it, and tellthe earth three times what you know, then throw the mold in again andfill up the hole."The apprentice chose the last course; went into the field outside thecity, dug a hole, into which he thrust his head, and called out threetimes-"The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears."Then he filled up the hole again, and with his mind quite relieved wenthome.When some time had passed by, there sprang an elder tree out of thisvery hole, and three slender sterns grew up, beautiful and straight astapers.  Some shepherds found this elder, cut off one of the stems, andmade a pipe of it.  But as soon as they began to blow into the newpipe, out burst the words:"The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears!"The news of this strange occurrence spread immediately through thewhole city, and at last the Emperor Trojan himself heard the childrenblowing on a pipe:"The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears!"He sent instantly for the barber's apprentice, and shouted to him-"Heh!  what is this you have been telling the people about me."The poor youth began at once to explain that he had indeed noticed theemperor's ears, but had never told a soul of it.  The emperor tore hissaber out of its sheath to hew the apprentice down, at which the youthwas so frightened that he told the whole story in its order: how he hadconfessed himself to the earth; how an elder tree had sprang up on thevery spot; and how, when a pipe was made of one of its sterns, the talewas sounded in every direction.Then the emperor took the apprentice with him in a carriage to theplace, to convince himself of the truth of the story; and when theyarrived there they found there was only a single stem left.  TheEmperor Trojan ordered a pipe to be made out of this stem, that hemight hear how it sounded.  As soon as the pipe was ready, and one ofthem blew into it, out poured the words:"The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears!"Then the emperor was convinced that nothing on this earth could behidden, spared the barber apprentices life, and henceforth allowed anybarber, without exception, to come and shave him.THE MAIDEN WHO WAS WISER THAN THE KINGBy W. S. KarajichTHERE once lived a poor man in a miserable hovel, who had no one withhim save an only daughter.  But she was very wise, and went abouteverywhere seeking alms, and taught her father also to speak in abecoming manner when he begged.  It happened once that the poor mancame to the king and asked for a gift.  The king demanded whence hecame, and who had taught him to speak so well.  The man said whence hecame, and that it was his daughter who had taught him."And who taught your daughter?"  asked the king.The poor man answered: "God, and our great poverty.''Then the king gave him thirty eggs, saying-"Take these eggs to your daughter, and tell her to hatch chickens outof them, and I will reward her handsomely; but if she cannot hatchthem, it will go ill with you."The poor man went crying back to his hovel, and related to his daughterwhat had passed.  The maiden saw at once that the eggs had been boiled,but she told her father to go to rest, and assured him that she wouldsee that all went well.  The father followed her advice, and went tosleep; the maiden took a pot, filled it with water and beans, and setit on the fire.  On the following morning, the beans being quiteboiled, she told her father to take a plow and oxen, and to plow alongthe road where the king would pass."And," she added, "when you see the king, take the beans, sow them, andcry, 'Hi!  go on, oxen mine!  Heaven be with me, and make my boiledbeans take root and grow!'  And when the king asks you how it ispossible for boiled beans to grow, answer him, that it is quite aspossible as for boiled eggs to yield chickens."The poor man hearkened to his daughter, went away, and began to plow.When he saw the king coming he began to cry-"Hi, go on, oxen mine!  God help me, and make my boiled beans take rootand grow!"The king, hearing these words, stopped on the road, and said to thepoor man-"Here, fellow!  how is it possible for boiled beans to grow?"And the poor man answered him-"Heaven prosper you, king!  just as possible as for boiled eggs toyield chickens."The king guessed at once that it was the poor man's daughter who hadtaught him this answer.  He ordered his servants to seize him and bringhim into his presence.  Then he gave him a bundle of flax, and said tohim-"Take this flax and make out of it ropes and sails and all that iswanted on shipboard; if you do not, you shall lose your head."The poor man took the bundle in great fear, and went crying home to hisdaughter, to whom he related all that had passed.  But the maiden senthim again to rest with the promise that all should go well.  On thefollowing day she took a small piece of wood, awoke her father, andsaid to him-"Take this wood, and carry it to the king; let him cut a spinningwheel, a spindle, and a loom out of it, and I will do all that hedemands of me."The poor man again followed the directions of his daughter; he went tothe king and delivered the maiden's message.  The king was astonishedat hearing this, and began to think what he should do next.  At last hetook up a small cup, and said as he gave it to the father-"Take this cup to your daughter, and let her empty the sea with it, sothat it shall become like a dry field."The poor man obeyed with tears in his eyes, and took the cup to hisdaughter with the king's message.  But the maiden told him he need onlyleave the matter till the morning, when she would see to it.In the morning she called her father, and gave him a pound of tow totake to the king, and bade him say:"Let the king stop up all the springs and river mouths of the earthwith this tow, and then will I dry up the sea for him."And the poor man went and told this to the king.Now the king saw that this maiden was wiser that he was himself, and heordered her to be brought before him.  And when the father and daughterstood in his presence and bowed before him, he said to the daughter-"Tell me, girl, what is it that man hears the farthest?"And the maiden answered- "Great king!  that which man hears thefarthest is the thunder, and a lie."Upon this the king took hold of his beard, and turning to hiscouncilors, demanded of them:"Tell me what my beard is worth?"And when one valued it at so much, and another at so much more, themaiden told them outright that they could not guess it.  "The king'sbeard," she said, "is of as much worth as three rainy days in summertime."The king was astonished and exclaimed, "The maiden has made the bestanswer!"Then he asked her if she would be his wife, nor would he desist frompressing his suit, until she agreed to it.  The maiden bent before himand said-"Glorious king!  let it be as you will; but I beg of you to write on apiece of paper with your own hand, that, should you ever be angry withme, and should drive me forth from your palace, I shall be at libertyto take whatever I love dearest away with me."And the king agreed and wrote out the paper.  After some time hadpassed away, it came, in fact, to pass, that the king became one day soangry with his wife, that he said to her-"I will have you no longer for my wife; leave my palace, and go whereyou will.""Illustrious king!"  answered the queen, "I will obey you.  Permit me,however, to stay here over the night, then in the morning I will goforth."The king granted her prayer; and the queen before supper mixed somebrandy and some sweet herbs in the king's wine, and pressed him topartake of it, saying-"Drink, O king, and be merry.  To-morrow we part; and believe me, Ishall then be happier than when I married you."The king drank too much, and when he was fast asleep, the queen had himlaid in a wagon ready prepared, and drove with him into a rocky cavern.And when the king awoke in the cavern, and saw where he was, he criedout-"Who has brought me here?""I have brought you here," answered the queen.The king demanded of her:"Why have you done this?  Have I not told you that you are no longer mywife?"Then said she, as she drew forth a sheet of paper-"It is true what you say; but see what you yourself have laid down onthis sheet: that when I should leave you, I might take with me, fromyour palace, that which I loved best."When the king heard this, he kissed her, and went back with her to thepalace.THE THREE SONSBy Lady GregoryI'LL tell you a story, says the old man who was bringing fish from thesea; and after that I'll be going on to Ballinrobe, to one that has ashop there and that was reared by my grandmother.  It is likely he'llgive me a tasty suit of clothes.Working all my life I am, working with the flail in the barn, workingwith the spade at the potato tilling and the potato digging, breakingstones on the road.  And four years ago the wife died, and it'slonesome to be housekeeping alone.There was a King long ago in Ireland, and he had three sons, and one ofthem was something silly.  There came a sickness on the King, and hecalled his three sons, and he said to them that he had knowledge theonly thing would cure him was the apples from Burnett's orchard, and hebade them to go look for them, for that orchard was in some far-awayplace, and no one could tell where it was.The three sons went then, and they caught their horses, and put ontheir bridles, and they set out, and went on till they came to threecrossroads.  There they stopped, and they settled among themselves thateach one of them would take one of the roads and go searching for theapples, and they would meet at the same place at the end of a year anda day.The youngest son, that was a bit silly, took the crossest of the roads,and he went on till he came to a cottage by the roadside.  He went in,and there was a withered old man in the house, and he said:  "There isa great welcome before the King of Ireland's son!"  The son wasastonished at that because he thought no one could know him.  He waswell received there, and in the course of the evening he asked the oldman did he know where was Burnett's garden.  "I am a hundred yearsold," said the man, "and I never heard of such a place.  But I have abrother," he said, "that is a hundred years older than I am, and it maybe he would know," he said.So in the morning he gave a canoe to the King's son, and it went on ofitself without him turning or guiding it, till it brought him to theold man's brother, and he got a welcome there and good treatment, andin the course of the night he asked that old man did he know where wasBurnett's orchard."I do not," said he: "though I am two hundred years old I never heardof it.  But go on," he said, "to a brother I have that has a hundredyears more than myself."So in the morning, he went into the canoe, and it went on of itselftill it came to where the third old man was, that was older again thanthe other two, and the King's son asked did he know where was Burnett'sgarden.  "I do not," he said, "although I am three hundred years old;but I will tell you how you will know it," he said.  "Go on till youcome to shore, where you will see a Swan-Gander standing by the water,and he is the one that can tell you and can bring you to it," he said."And ask him to bring you to that garden in the name of the AlmightyGod."So the King's son went on in the canoe till he came where the Swan-Gander was standing on the shore.  "Can you tell me," says he, "wherecan I get the apples that are in Burnett's orchard?  And can you bringme there?"  he said."Indeed," said the Swan-Gander, "I am in no way obliged to your leader,or to whoever it was sent you to me and gave you that teaching.  Andthose apples are well minded," he said, "by wolves; and the only timethey sleep is for three hours once in every seven years.  And itchances they are asleep for those three hours at this time; and so Iwill bring you there," he said.With that he stretched out his wings, and he bade the King's son to geton his back.  And it was long before he could start flying with theweight that was on him; but at last he flew away, and he brought theKing's son to Burnett's garden, and there was a high wall around it,but he flew over the wall, and put him down in the garden.  The King'sson filled his bag with the apples, and when he had done that he wentlooking around, and he came to a large cottage in the garden, and hewent in, and there was no one in the house but a beautiful young girl,and she was asleep.  So he went away; but he brought with him the goldrings and the gold garters that he saw there in the window.He got up again on the back of the Swan-Gander, but it was hard for itto rise with the weight of the bag of apples.  But it did rise at last,and it brought him to where the old man was that was three hundredyears old.  The King's son gave one of the apples to the old man, andno sooner did he eat it than his age left him, and he was like a boy offifteen years.He went on then to the two other old men, and gave an apple to both ofthem, and no sooner did they eat it than they were like young boysagain.Then the King's son went back to the crossroads, for it was the end ofthe year and a day, and he was the first to come there, and he fellasleep.  The two brothers came and saw him there, and they stole thebag of apples from under his head and put in the place of it a bag ofapples that were no use at all.  Then they went on to their father'shouse, and they gave him the apples they had stolen, and he was curedon the moment; but they told him that what the youngest son wasbringing to him was poison apples, that would bring him to his death.The King was very angry when he heard that, and he went to his butlerand said, "Go out to the wood where my son is, and shoot him, and bringhis heart here with you on the top of a gun and throw it to the dogs atthe door; for I will never have him, or anything belonging to him,brought into the house," he said.So the butler got the gun, and went out to the wood; and when he sawthe young man he was going to shoot him.  "Why would you do that?"said he.  So the butler told him all the father ordered him; and theyoung man said, "Do not shoot me, but save me.  And this is what youwill do.  Go into the wood until you meet with a woodcock, and shootit, and take the heart out of it, for that is most like the heart of aman.  Bring the woodcock's heart to my father's house," he said, "andthrow it to the dogs at the door."So the butler did that, and spared him, and took the woodcock's heartand threw it to the dogs at the door.It was a good while after that, a beautiful young lady came to theKing's doorway in a coach and four, and stopped at the door.  "Send outmy husband to me here," she said.  So the eldest son came out to her."Was it you came to the garden for the apples?"  says she.  "It was,"says he.  "What things did you take notice of in the cottage where Iwas?" says she.So he began telling of this thing and that thing that never was in itat all.And when she heard that she gave him a clout that knocked his head assolid as any stone in the wall.Then the second son came out, and she asked him the same question, andhe told the same lies, and she gave him another clout that left hishead as solid as any stone in the wall.When the King heard all that, he knew they had deceived him, and thatit was the youngest son who got the apples for his cure, and he beganto cry after him and to lament that he was not living to come backagain.  "Would you like to know he is living yet?"  says the butler."I would sooner hear it than any word ever I heard," says the King."Well he is living yet, and is in the wood," says the butler.When the young lady heard that, she bade the butler bring her to wherehe was, and they went together to the wood, and there they found him,where he had been living on the fruits of trees through the most of theyear.  When the young lady saw him, she said: "Was it you came to thehouse where I was in the garden?"  "It was," says he."What things did you take notice of in it?""Here they are," says he.  And he put his hand in his pocket, andbrought out the gold rings and the golden garters, and the other signshe had brought away.So she knew that he was the right one, and she married him, and theylived happy ever after, and there was great rejoicing in the King ofIreland's house.HOK LEE AND THE DWARFSRetold by Andrew LangTHERE once lived in a small town in China a man named Hok Lee.  He wasa steady, industrious man, who not only worked hard at his trade, butdid all his own housework as well, for he had no wife to do it for him."What an excellent, industrious man is this Hok Lee!" said hisneighbors.  "How hard he works!  He never leaves his house to amusehimself or to take a holiday as others do!"But Hok Lee was by no means the virtuous person his neighbors thoughthim.  True, he worked hard enough by day, but at night, when allrespectable folk were fast asleep, he used to steal out and join adangerous band of robbers, who broke into rich people's houses andcarried off all they could lay hands on.This state of things went on for some time, and though a thief wascaught now and then and punished, no suspicion ever fell on Hok Lee, hewas such a very respectable, hard-working man.Hok Lee had already amassed a good store of money as his share of theproceeds of these robberies, when it happened one morning on going tomarket that a neighbor said to him:"Why, Hok Lee, what is the matter with your face?  One side of it isall swelled up."True enough, Hok Lee's right cheek was twice the size of his left, andit soon began to feel very uncomfortable."I will bind up my face," said Hok Lee.  "Doubtless the warmth willcure the swelling."  But no such thing.  Next day it was worse, and dayby day it grew bigger and bigger till it was nearly as large as hishead and became very painful.Hok Lee was at his wits' end what to do.  Not only was his checkunsightly and painful, but his neighbors began to jeer and make fun ofhim, which hurt his feelings very much indeed.One day, as luck would have it, a traveling doctor came to the town.He sold not only all kinds of medicine, but also dealt in many strangecharms against witches and evil spirits.Hok Lee determined to consult him and asked him into his house.  Afterthe doctor had examined him carefully he spoke thus:"This, Hok Lee, is no ordinary swelled face.  I strongly suspect youhave been doing some wrong deed which has called down the anger of thespirits on you.  None of my drugs will avail to cure you, but if youare willing to pay me handsomely I can tell you how you may be cured."Then Hok Lee and the doctor began to bargain together, and it was along time before they could come to terms.  However, the doctor got thebetter of it in the end, for he was determined not to part with hissecret under a certain price, and Hok Lee had no mind to carry his hugecheek about with him to the end of his days.  So he was obliged to partwith the greater portion of his ill-gotten gains.When the doctor had pocketed the money he told Hok Lee to go on thefirst night of the full moon to a certain wood and there to watch by aparticular tree.  After a time he would see the dwarfs and littlesprites who live underground come out to dance.  When they saw him theywould be sure to make him dance too.  "And mind you dance your verybest," added the doctor.  "If you dance well and please them they willgrant you a petition and you can then beg to be cured; but if you dancebadly they will most likely do you some mischief out of spite."  Withthat he took leave and departed.Happily the first night of the full moon was near, and at the propertime Hok Lee set out for the wood.  With a little trouble he found thetree the doctor had described, and feeling nervous he climbed up intoit.He had hardly settled himself on a branch when he saw the little dwarfsassembling in the moonlight.  They came from all sides, till at lengththere appeared to be hundreds of them.  They seemed in high glee anddanced and skipped and capered about, while Hok Lee grew so eagerwatching them that he crept farther and farther along his branch tillat length it gave a loud crack.  All the dwarfs stood still, and HokLee felt as if his heart stood still also.Then one of the dwarfs called out: "Some one is up in that tree.  Comedown at once, whoever you are, or we must come and fetch you."In great terror Hok Lee proceeded to come down; but he was so nervousthat he tripped near the ground and came rolling down in the mostabsurd manner.  When he had picked himself up he came forward with alow bow, and the dwarf who had first spoken and who appeared to be theleader said: "Now, then, who art thou and what brings thee here?"So Hok Lee told him the sad story of his swelled cheek, and how he hadbeen advised to come to the forest and beg the dwarfs to cure him."It is well," replied the dwarf.  "We will see about that.  First,however, thou must dance before us.  Should thy dancing please us,perhaps we may be able to do something; but shouldst thou dance badlywe shall assuredly punish thee, so now take warning and dance away."With that, he and all the other dwarfs sat down in a large ring,leaving Hok Lee to dance alone in the middle.  He felt half-frightenedto death, and besides was a good deal shaken by his fall from the treeand did not feel at all inclined to dance.  But the dwarfs were not tobe trifled with."Begin!"  cried their leader, and "Begin!"  shouted the rest in chorus.So in despair Hok Lee began.  First he hopped on one foot and then onthe other, but he was so stiff and so nervous that he made but a poorattempt, and after a time sank down on the ground and vowed he coulddance no more.The dwarfs were very angry.  They crowded round Hok Lee and abused him."Thou to come here to be cured, indeed!" they cried.  "Thou hastbrought one big cheek with thee, but thou shalt take away two."  Andwith that they ran off and disappeared, leaving Hok Lee to find his wayhome as best he might.He hobbled away, weary and depressed, and not a little anxious onaccount of the dwarfs' threat.Nor were his fears unfounded, for when he rose next morning his leftcheek was swelled up as big as his right, and he could hardly see outof his eyes.  Hok Lee felt in despair, and his neighbors jeered at himmore than ever.  The doctor, too, had disappeared, so there was nothingfor it but to try the dwarfs once more.He waited a month till the first night of the full moon came roundagain, and then he trudged back to the forest and sat down under thetree from which he had fallen.  He had not long to wait.  Ere long thedwarfs came trooping out till all were assembled."I don't feel quite easy," said one.  "I feel as if some horrid humanbeing were near us."When Hok Lee heard this he came forward and bent down to the groundbefore the dwarfs, who came crowding round and laughed heartily at hiscomical appearance with his two big cheeks."'What dost thou want?" they asked; and Hok Lee proceeded to tell themof his fresh misfortunes and begged so hard to be allowed one moretrial at dancing that the dwarfs consented, for there is nothing theylove so much as being amused.Now, Hok Lee knew how much depended on his dancing well, so he pluckedup a good spirit and began, first quite slowly and faster by degrees,and he danced so well and gracefully, and made such new and wonderfulsteps, that the dwarfs were quite delighted with him.They clapped their tiny hands and shouted:"Well done, Hok Lee, well done.  Go on-dance more, for we are pleased."And Hok Lee danced on and on, till he really could dance no more andwas obliged to stop.Then the leader of the dwarfs said: "We are well pleased, Hok Lee, andas a recompense for thy dancing thy face shall he cured.  Farewell."With these words he and the other dwarfs vanished, and Hok Lee, puttinghis hands to his face, found to his great joy that his cheeks werereduced to their natural size.  The way home seemed short and easy tohim, and he went to bed happy and resolved never to go out robbingagain.Next day the whole town was full of the news of Hok's sudden cure.  Hisneighbors questioned him, but could get nothing from him, except thefact that he had discovered a wonderful cure for all kinds of diseases.After a time a rich neighbor, who had been ill for some years, came andoffered to give Hok Lee a large sum of money if he would tell him howhe might get cured.  Hok Lee consented on condition that he swore tokeep the secret.  He did so, and Hok Lee told him of the dwarfs andtheir dances.The neighbor went off, carefully obeyed Hok Lee's directions, and wasduly cured by the dwarfs.  Then another and another came to Hok Lee tobeg his secret, and from each he extracted a vow of secrecy and a largesum of money.  This went on for some years, so that at length Hok Leebecame a very wealthy man and ended his days in peace and prosperity.A DREADFUL BOARBy Adele M. FieldeA POOR Old Woman, who lived with her one little granddaughter in awood, was out gathering sticks for fuel and found a green stalk ofsugar-cane which she added to her bundle.  She presently met an elf inthe form of a Wild Boar, that asked her for the cane.  She declinedgiving it to him, saying that at her age to stoop and to rise again wasto earn what she picked up, and she was going to take the cane home andlet her little granddaughter suck its sap.The Boar, angry at her refusal, said that during the coming night hewould come and eat her granddaughter instead of the cane, and went offinto the wood.When the Old Woman reached her cabin she sat down by the door andwailed, for she knew that she had no means of defending herself againstthe Boar.  While she sat crying a vender of needles came along andasked her what was the matter.  She told him, but all that he could dofor her was to give her a box of needles.  The Old Woman stuck theneedles thickly over the lower half of the door, on its outer side, andthen went on crying.Just then a Man came along with a basket of crabs, heard herlamentations, and stopped to inquire what was the matter.  She toldhim, but he said he knew no help for her, but he would do the best hecould for her by giving her half his crabs.  The woman put the crabs inher water jar, behind her door, and again sat down and cried.A Farmer, who was coming along from the fields, leading his ox, alsoasked the cause of her distress and heard her story.  He said he wassorry he could not think of any way of preventing the evil sheexpected, but that he would leave his ox to stay all night with her, asit might be a sort of company for her in her loneliness.  She led theox into her cabin, tied it to the head of her bedstead, gave it somestraw, and then sat down to cry again.A courier returning on horseback from a neighboring town was the nextto pass her door, and he dismounted to inquire what troubled her.Having heard her tale, he said he would leave his horse to stay withher, and make the ox more contented.  So she tied the horse to the footof the bed, and, thinking how surely evil was coming upon her, sheburst out crying anew.A boy just then came along with a snapping turtle that he had caughtand stopped to ask what had happened to her.  On learning the cause ofher weeping he said it was no use to contend against sprites, but thathe would give her his snapping turtle as a proof of his sympathy.  Shetook the turtle, tied it in front of her bedstead, and continued tocry.Some men who were carrying millstones then came along, inquired intoher trouble, and expressed their compassion by giving her a millstone,which they rolled into her back yard.  While they were doing this a Manwent by carrying hoes and a pickaxe, and he stopped and asked her whyshe was crying so hard.  She told him her grief, and he said he wouldgladly help her if he could, but he was only a well digger and could donothing for her except to dig a well.  She pointed out a place in thebackyard, and he went to work and quickly dug a well.On his departure the old woman cried again, until a Paper Seller cameand inquired what was the matter.  When she told him he gave her alarge sheet of white paper, as a token of pity, and she laid itsmoothly over the mouth of the well.Nightfall came.  The old woman shut and barred her door, put hergranddaughter snugly on the wall side of the bed, and then lay downbeside her to await the foe.At midnight the Boar came and threw himself against the door to breakit in.  The needles wounded him sorely, so that when he had gained anentrance he was heated and thirsty, and went to the water jar to drink.When he thrust in his snout the crabs attacked him, clung to hisbristles, and pinched his ears, till he rolled over and over to freehimself.Then in a rage he approached the front of the bed; but the snappingturtle nipped his tail and made him retreat under the feet of thehorse, who kicked him over to the ox, and the ox tossed him back to thehorse.  Thus beset, he was glad to escape to the back yard to take arest and to consider the situation.Seeing a clean paper spread on the ground, he went to lie upon it, andfell into the well.  The Old Woman, hearing the fall, rushed out androlled the millstone down on him and crushed him.THE FIVE QUEER BROTHERSBy Adele M. FieldeAN old woman had five grown-up sons that looked just alike.  The eldestcould gulp up the ocean at a mouthful; the second was hard enough tonick steel; the third had extensible legs; the fourth was unaffected byfire; the fifth lived without breathing.  They all concealed theirpeculiar traits, and their neighbors did not know they were queer.The eldest supported the family by fishing, going alone to the sea, andbringing back loads of spoil.  The neighbors often besought him toteach their sons how to fish, and he at last let all their boys go withhim, one day, to learn his art.  On reaching the shore he sucked thesea into his mouth, and sent the boys to the dry bottom to collect thefish.  When he was tired of holding the water, he beckoned to the boysto return, but they were playing among strange objects and paid no heedto him.  When he could contain the sea no longer, he had to let it flowback into its former basin, and all the boys were drowned.As he went homeward, he passed the doom of the parents, who inquiredhow many fish their sons had caught and how long they would be incoming back.  He told them the facts, but they would not excuse him.They dragged him before the magistrate to account for the loss of theirchildren.  He defended himself by saying he had not invited the boys togo with him, and had consented to their going only when the parents hadrepeatedly urged him; that after the boys were on the ocean bed, he haddone his utmost to induce them to come ashore; that he had held thewater as long as he could, and had then put it in the sea basin solelybecause nothing else would contain it.Notwithstanding this defense the judges decided that since he took theboys away and did not bring them back, he was guilty of murder andsentenced him to be beheaded.He entreated leave to pay, before his execution, one visit to his agedmother, and this was granted.He went alone and told his brothers of his doom, and the second brotherreturned in his stead to the judge, thanked him for having given himpermission to perform a duty required by filial piety, and said he wasthen ready to die.He knelt with bowed head and the headsman brought the knife down acrossthe back of his neck, but the knife was nicked and the neck was leftunharmed.A second knife and a third of finer steel were brought and tried byheadsmen who were accustomed to sever heads clean off at one stroke.Having spoiled their best blades without so much as scratching hisneck, they took him back to prison and informed the judge that thesentence could not be executed.The judge accordingly decreed that he should be dropped into the seawhich covered his victims.When the old woman's son heard this decision he said that he took leaveof his mother supposing that his head was to be cut off, and that if hewas to be drowned he must go to her and make known his fate and get herblessing anew.Permission being given, he went and told his brothers what hadhappened.  The third brother took the place of the second and presentedhimself before the judge as the criminal that was to be sunk in thesea.  He was carried far from shore and thrown overboard, but hestretched his legs till his feet touched bottom, and he stood with hishead in the air.  They hauled him aboard and took him farther fromland, but still his extensible legs supported him above the waters.Then they sailed to mid-ocean and cast him into its greatest depths,but his legs still lengthened so that he was not drowned.  They broughthim back to the judge, reported what had been done, and said that someother method of destroying him must be followed.On hearing this the judge condemned him to death by being boiled inoil.  While the caldron was being heated he begged and obtainedpermission to go and tell his mother of the way he had survived fromthe attempt to drown him, and of the manner in which he was soon to betaken off.His brothers having heard the latest judgment, the fourth one went tobear the penalty of the law and was lowered into the kettle of boilingoil.  In this he disported himself as if in a tepid bath, and he evenasked his executioners to stir up the fire a little to increase thewarmth.  Finding that he could not be fried, he was remanded to prison.At this the populace, the bereaved parents, and the magistrate joinedin an effort to invent a sure method of putting him to death.  Water,fire, and sword all having failed, they finally fixed upon smotheringhim in a vast cream cake.The whole country round made contributions of flour for the pastry, ofsugar for the filling, and of bricks for a huge oven; and it was madeand baked on a plain outside the city walls.Meanwhile the prisoner was allowed to go and bid his mother farewell,and the fifth brother secretly became his substitute.When the cake was done, a multitude of people with oxen, horses, andropes dragged it to the execution ground, and within it the culprit wasinterred.As he was able to exist without air he rested peacefully till the nextmidnight, and then safely crawled forth, returned to his home, anddwelt there happily for many years with his remarkable brothers.THE ACCOMPLISHED AND LUCKY TEAKETTLEBy A. B. MitfordA LONG time ago, at a temple called Morinji, there was an oldteakettle.  One day, when the priest of the temple was about to hang itover the hearth to boil the water for his tea, to his amazement thekettle all of a sudden put forth the head and tail of a badger.  What awonderful kettle, to come out all over fur!The priest, thunderstruck, called in the novices or assistants of thetemple to see the sight; and while they were stupidly staring, onesuggesting one thing and another another, the kettle, jumping up intothe air, began flying about the room.  More astonished than ever, thepriest and his pupils tried to pursue it; but no thief or cat was everhalf so sharp as the wonderful badger kettle.  At last, however, theymanaged to knock it down and secure it; and, holding it in with theirunited efforts, they forced it into a box, intending to carry it offand throw it away in some distant place, so that they might no more beplagued with the goblin.For this day their troubles were over, but as luck would have it, thetinker who was in the habit of working for the temple called in, andthe priest suddenly bethought him that it was a pity to throw thekettle away for nothing, and that he might as well get a trifle for it,no matter how small.  So he brought out the kettle, which had resumedits former shape and had got rid of its head and tail, and showed it tothe tinker.  When the tinker saw the kettle, he offered twenty coppercoins for it, and the priest was only too glad to close the bargain andbe rid of his troublesome piece of furniture.  And the tinker trudgedoff home with his pack and his new purchase.That night, as he lay asleep, he heard a strange noise near his pillow;so he peeped out from under the bedclothes and there he saw the kettlethat he had bought in the temple covered with fur and walking about onfour legs.  The tinker started up in a fright to see what it could allmean, when all of a sudden the kettle resumed its former shape.  Thishappened over and over again, until at last the tinker showed theteakettle to a friend of his, who said, "This is certainly anaccomplished and lucky teakettle-you should take it about as a show,with songs and accompaniments of musical instruments, and make it danceand walk on the tight rope."The tinker, thinking this good advice, made arrangements with ashowman, and set up an exhibition.  The noise of the kettle'sperformances soon spread abroad, until even the princes of the landsent to order the tinker to come to them; and he grew rich beyond allexpectations.  Even the princesses, too, and the great ladies of thecourt, took great delight in the dancing kettle, so that no sooner hadit shown its tricks in one place than it was time for them to keep someother engagement.At last the tinker grew so rich that he took the kettle back to thetemple, where it was laid up as a precious treasure and worshiped as asaint.THE ADVENTURES OF LITTLE PEACHLINGBy A. B. MitfordMANY hundred years ago there lived an honest old woodcutter and hiswife.  One fine morning the old man went off to the hills with his billhook to gather a faggot of sticks, while his wife went down to theriver to wash the dirty clothes.  When she came to the river, she saw apeach floating down the stream; so she picked it up and carried ithomeward with her, thinking to give it to her husband to eat when heshould come in.  The old man soon came down from the hills, and thegood wife set the peach before him, when, just as she was inviting himto eat it, the fruit split in two and a little baby was born into theworld.  So the old couple took the babe and brought it up as their own;and because it had been born in a peach, they called it Momotaro, orLittle Peachhing!By degrees Little Peachling grew up to be strong and brave, and at lastone day he said to his old foster parents-"I am going to the ogres' island, to carry off the riches they havestored up there.  Pray, then, make me some millet dumplings for myjourney."So the old folks ground the millet and made the dumplings for him; andLittle Peachling, after taking an affectionate leave of them,cheerfully set out on his travels.As he was journeying on, he fell in with an Ape, who gibbered at him,and said,"Kia!  kia!  kia!  where are you off to, Little Peachling?""I'm going to the ogres' island, to carry off their treasure," answeredLittle Peachling."What are you carrying at your girdle?""I'm carrying the very best millet dumplings in all Japan."If you'll give me one, I will go with you," said the Ape.So Little Peachhing gave one of his dumplings to the Ape, who receivedit and followed him.  When he had gone a little farther, he heard aPheasant calling-"Ken!  ken!  ken!  where are you off to, Master Peachling?"Little Peachling answered as before; and the Pheasant, having beggedand obtained a millet dumpling, entered his service and followed him.A little while after this they met a Dog, who cried-Bow!  wow!  wow!  whither away, Master Peachling?""I'm going off to the ogres' island, to carry off their treasure."If you will give me one of those nice millet dumplings of yours, Iwill go with you," said the Dog."With all my heart," said Little Peachling.  So he went on his way,with the Ape, the Pheasant, and the Dog following after him.When they got to the ogres' island, the Pheasant flew over the castlegate and the Ape clambered over the castle wall, while LittlePeachling, leading the Dog, forced in the gate and got into the castle.Then they did battle with the ogres and put them to flight, and tooktheir King prisoner.  So all the ogres did homage to Little Peachling,and brought out the treasures which they had laid up.  There were capsand coats that made their wearers invisible, jewels which governed theebb and the flow of the tide, coral, musk, emeralds, amber, andtortoise shells, besides gold and silver.  All these were laid beforeLittle Peachling by the conquered ogres.So Little Peachling went home laden with riches, and maintained hisfoster parents in peace and plenty for the remainder of their lives.THE TWO LIZARDSBy Annie KerIN the old days there lived two lizards, Webubu and Nagari.  Webubu wasplain of speech, and moreover was unable to cry aloud, but Nagari, bystretching his long neck, could produce a sweet low sound, somewhatafter the manner of a whistle.Nagari longed for companions, so he stretched his neck and cried "U-u-u-u-u."  Then many women, hearing the sweet sound, flocked to whereNagari sat, and listened to his music.  This pleased Nagari, and hecontinued to sound his long note.  "U-u-u-u-u," he sang, and the womensat so still, one might have thought them dead or weeping.Webubu, on the contrary, had no one to cheer him in his loneliness."What can I do," he said, "to draw women to me as Nagari has done?  Ihave not a sweet voice as he has.  What can I do?"As he was speaking a thought grew up in his heart, and he began to act.He cut a slim piece of hollow bamboo, and pierced small holes in it.Thus was the first flute (duraio) born.  Webubu then built himself aplatform high in a corkwood tree, which we call "troba" on the beach,and seating himself there he began to play his flute.The women sat patiently around Nagari, while he sounded his one note,"U-u-u!"  But on a sudden, upon the still air, broke the sweet voice ofWebubu's flute.  High and sweet were the notes which Webubu sent forthfrom his flute."M!  m!" said the listening women."U-u-u-u," sang Nagari."Ah, ss-ss-ss!" cried the women.  "Deafen us not with thy 'U,' when wewould hear this strange music!"Nagari was much troubled at this saying, and marveled greatly.  Thenone woman made bold to rise up, and saying, "I shall return," she wentto seek the sweet music.  Now this woman lied, for she never returned.After a time, another woman arose and said, "Stay here, my friends; Ishall return."Then she went in like manner to look for the music.  And she also lied,for she returned not.  And so with each woman, until Nagari was leftsitting alone as he had been at the beginning.Now Webubu was still playing his flute on the platform he had built inthe corkwood tree, when the women came in sight.  He was alarmed forthe safety of his frail platform, when he saw these many peopleadvancing, and he cried, "Come not up into the tree.  Remain below, Ibeseech you, O women!"But the women were consumed with eagerness to be close to the musicwhich had taken their hearts, and they climbed, all of them, until theywere upon the platform of Webubu.Then straightway what he had feared came to pass, and Webubu, and hisflute, and the multitude of women fell crashing through the branches ofthe corkwood tree to the ground beneath.And from that hour until now, all corkwood trees lean toward the earth,as I will show thee, if thou wilt go with me to the beach where theygrow.DE KING AND DE PEAFOWLBy Mary Pamela Milne-HorneONE day once 'pon a time de King hab a party of ladies an' genelmen.An' arter de party, de band was ter come an' play.

He had little enough to break orbite, and once, when there was a great famine in the land, he could notprocure even his daily bread; and as he lay thinking in his bed oneevening, rolling about for trouble, he sighed, and said to his wife,"What will become of us?  How can we feed our children when we have nomore than we can eat ourselves?""Know, then, my husband," answered she, "we will lead them away quiteearly in the morning into the thickest part of the wood, and there makethem a fire, and give them each a little piece of bread; then we willgo to our work and leave them alone, so they will not find the way homeagain and we shall be freed from them."  "No, wife," replied he, "thatI can never do; how can you bring your heart to leave my children allalone in the wood, for the wild beasts will soon come and tear them topieces?""Oh, you simpleton!" said she, "then we must all four die of hunger;you had better plane the coffins for us."  But she left him no peacetill he consented saying, "Ah, but I shall regret the poor children."The two children, however, had not gone to sleep for very hunger, andso they overheard what the stepmother said to their father.  Grethelwept bitterly, and said to Hansel, "What will become of us?"  "Bequiet, Grethel," said he; "do not cry, I will soon help you."  And assoon as their parents had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his coat,and, unbarring the back door, slipped out.  The moon shone brightly,and the white pebbles which lay before the door seemed like silverpieces, they glittered so brightly.  Hansel stooped down, and put asmany into his pocket as it would hold, and then going back he said toGrethel, "Be comforted, dear sister, and sleep in peace; God will notforsake us;" and so saying he went to bed again.The next morning, before the sun arose, the wife went and awoke the twochildren.  "Get up, you lazy things; we are going into the forest tochop wood."  Then she gave them each a piece of bread, saying, "Thereis something for your dinner; do not eat it before the time, for youwill get nothing else."  Grethel took the bread in her apron, forHansel's pocket was full of pebbles; and so they all set out upon theirway.  When they had gone a little distance Hansel stood still, andpeeped back at the house; and this he repeated several times, till hisfather said, "Hansel, what are you peeping at, and why do you lagbehind?  Take care, and remember your legs.""Ah!  father," said Hansel, "I am looking at my white cat sitting uponthe roof of the house, and trying to say good-by."  "You simpleton!"said the wife, "that is not a cat; it is only the sun shining on thewhite chimney."  But in reality Hansel was not looking at a cat; butevery time he stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon thepath.When they came to the middle of the wood the father told the childrento collect wood, and he would make them a fire, so that they should notbe cold; so Hansel and Grethel gathered together quite a littlemountain of twigs.  Then they set fire to them, and as the flame burnedup high the wife said, "Now, you children, lie down near the fire andrest yourself, while we go into the forest and chop Wood; when we areready, I will come and call you."Hansel and Grethel sat down by the fire, and when it was noon each atethe piece of bread, and, because they could hear the blows of an ax,they thought their father was near; but it was not an ax, but a branchwhich he had bound to a withered tree, so as to be blown to and fro bythe wind.  They waited so long that at last their eyes closed fromweariness, and they fell fast asleep.  When they awoke it was quitedark, and Grethel began to cry; "How shall we get out of the wood?"But Hansel tried to comfort her by saying, "Wait a little while tillthe moon rises, and then we will quickly find the way."  The moon soonshone forth, and Hansel, taking his sister's hand, followed thepebbles, which glittered like new-coined silver pieces, and showed themthe path.  All night long they walked on, and as day broke they came totheir father's house.  They knocked at the door, and when the wifeopened it, and saw Hansel and Grethel, she exclaimed, "You wickedchildren!  why did you sleep so long in the wood?  We thought you werenever coming home again."  But their father was very glad, for it hadgrieved his heart to leave them all alone.Not long afterward there was again great scarcity in every corner ofthe land; and one night the children overheard their mother saying totheir father, "Everything is again consumed; we have only half a loafleft, and then the song is ended: the children must be sent away.  Wewill take them deeper into the wood, so that they may not find the wayout again; it is the only means of escape for us."But her husband felt heavy at heart, and thought, "It were better toshare the last crust with the children."  His wife, however, wouldlisten to nothing that he said and scolded and, reproached him withoutend.  He who says A must say B too; and he who consents the first timemust also the second.The children, however, had heard the conversation as they lay awake,and as soon as the old people went to sleep Hansel got up intending' topick up some pebbles as before; but the wife had locked the door, sothat he could not get out.  Nevertheless he comforted Grethel, saying,"Do not cry; sleep in quiet; the good God will not forsake us."Early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed,and gave them each a slice of bread, which was still smaller than theformer piece.  On the way Hansel broke his in his pocket, and, stoppingevery now and then, dropped a crumb upon the path.  "Hansel, why do youstop and look about?" said the father.  "Keep in the path." - "I amlooking at my little dove," answered Hansel, "nodding a good-by to me.""Simpleton!" said the wife, "that is no dove, but only the sun shiningon the chimney."So Hansel kept still dropping crumbs as he went along.The mother led the children deep into the wood, where they had neverbeen before, and there making an immense fire, she said to them, "Sitdown here and rest, and when you feel tired you can sleep for a littlewhile.  We are going into the forest to hew wood, and in the evening,when we are ready, we will come and fetch you."When noon came Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewn hison the path.  Then they went to sleep; but the evening arrived, and noone came to visit the poor children, and in the dark night they awoke,and Hansel comforted his sister by saying, "Only wait, Grethel, tillthe moon comes out, then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I havedropped, and they will show us the way home."  The moon shone and theygot up, but they could not see any crumbs, for the thousands of birdswhich had been flying about in the woods and fields had picked them allup.  Hansel kept saying to Grethel, "We will soon find the way"; butthey did not, and they walked the whole night long and the next day,but still they did not come out of the wood; and they got so hungry,for they had nothing to eat but the berries which they found upon thebushes.Soon they got so tired that they could not drag themselves along, sothey laid down under a tree and went to sleep.It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house,and they still walked on; but they only got deeper and deeper into thewood, and Hansel saw that if help did not come very soon they would dieof hunger.As soon as it was noon they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sittingupon a bough which sang so sweetly that they stood still and listenedto it.  It soon left off, and spreading its wings, flew off; and theyfollowed it until it arrived at a cottage, upon the roof of which itperched; and when they went close up to it they saw that the cottagewas made of bread and cakes, and the windowpanes were of clear sugar."We will go in there," said Hansel, "and have a glorious feast.  I willeat a piece of the roof, and you can eat the window.  Will they not besweet?"  So Hansel reached up and broke a piece off the roof, in orderto see how it tasted; while Grethel stepped up to the window and beganto bite it.  Then a sweet voice called out in the room, "Tip-tap, tip-tap, who raps at my door?" and the children answered, "The wind, thewind, the child of heaven"; and they went on eating withoutinterruption.  Hansel thought the roof tasted very nice, and so he toreoff a great piece; while Grethel broke a large round pane out of thewindow, and sat down quite contentedly.  Just then the door opened, anda very old woman, walking upon crutches, came out.  Hansel and Grethelwere so frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands; butthe old woman, nodding her head, said, "Ah, you dear children, what hasbrought you here?  Come in and stop with me, and no harm shall befallyou;" and so saying she took them both by the hand, and led them intoher cottage.  A good meal of milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, andnuts, was spread on the table, and in the back room were two nicelittle beds, covered with white, where Hansel and Grethel laidthemselves down, and thought themselves in heaven.  The old woman hadbehaved very kindly to them, but in reality she was a wicked witch whowaylaid children, and built the bread house in order to entice them in;but as soon as they were in her power she killed them, cooked and atethem, and made a great festival of the day.  Witches have red eyes, andcannot see very far; but they have a fine sense of smelling, like wildbeasts, so that they know when children approach them.  When Hansel andGrethel came near the witch's house she laughed wickedly, saying, "Herecome two who shall not escape me."  And early in the morning, beforethey awoke, she went up to them, and saw how lovingly they laysleeping, with their chubby red cheeks; and she mumbled to herself,"That will be a good bite." Then she took up Hansel with her roughhand, and shut him up in a little cage with a lattice door; andalthough he screamed loudly, it was of no use.  Grethel came next, and,shaking her till she awoke, she said, "Get up, you lazy thing, andfetch some water to cook something good for your brother, who mustremain in that stall and get fat; when he is fat enough I shall, eathim."  Grethel began to cry, but it was all useless, for the old witchmade her do as she wished.  So a nice meal was cooked for Hansel, butGrethel got nothing else but a crab's claw.Every morning the old witch came to the cage and said, "Hansel, stretchyour finger that I may feel whether you are getting fat."  But Hanselused to stretch out a bone, and the old woman, having very bad sight,thought it was his finger, and wondered very much that it did not getfat.  When four weeks had passed, and Hansel still kept quite lean, shelost all her patience and would not wait any longer.  "Grethel." shecalled out in a passion, "get some water quickly; be Hansel fat orlean, this morning I will kill and cook him."  Oh, how the poor littlesister grieved, as she was forced to fetch the water, and how fast thetears ran down her cheeks!  "Dear good God, help us now!" sheexclaimed.  "Had we only been eaten by the wild beasts in the wood thenwe should have died together."  But the old witch called out, "Leaveoff that noise; it will not help you a bit."So early in the morning Grethel was forced to go out and fill thekettle, and make a fire.  "First we will bake, however," said the oldwoman; "I have already heated the oven and kneaded the dough"; and sosaying she pushed poor Grethel up to the oven, out of which the flameswere burning fiercely.  "Creep in," said the witch, "and see if it ishot enough, and then we will put in the bread"; but she intended whenGrethel got in to shut up the oven and let her bake, so that she mighteat her as well as Hansel.  Grethel perceived what her thoughts were,and said, "I do not know how to do it; how shall I get in?"  "Youstupid goose," said she, "the opening is big enough.  See, I could evenget in myself!" and she got up and put her head into the oven.  ThenGrethel gave her a push, so that she fell right in, and then shuttingthe iron door, she bolted it.  Oh!  how horribly she howled; butGrethel ran away, and left the ungodly witch to burn to ashes.Now she ran to Hansel, and, opening his door, called out, "Hansel, weare saved; the old witch is dead!"  So he sprang out, like a bird outof his cage when the door is opened; and they were so glad that theyfell upon each other's neck, and kissed each other over and over again.And now, as there was nothing to fear, they went into the witch'shouse, where in every corner were caskets full of pearls and preciousstones.  "These are better than pebbles," said Hansel, putting as manyinto his pocket as it would hold; while Grethel thought, "I will takesome home, too," and filled her apron full.  "We must be off now," saidHansel, "and get out of this bewitched forest"; but when they hadwalked for two hours they came to a large piece of water.  "We cannotget over," said Hansel.  "I can see no bridge at all."  "And there isno boat either," said Grethel; "but there swims a white duck, I willask her to help us over;" and she sang,"Little duck, good little duck,Grethel and Hansel, here we stand,There is neither stile nor bridge,Take us on your back to land."So the duck came to them, and Hansel sat himself on, and bade hissister sit behind him.  "No," answered Grethel, "that will be too muchfor the duck, she shall take us over one at a time."  This the goodlittle bird did, and when both were happily arrived on the other side,and had gone a little way, they came to a well-known wood, which theyknew the better every step they went, and at last they perceived theirfather's house.  Then they began to run, and, bursting into the house,they fell on their father's neck.  He had not had one happy hour sincehe had left the children in the forest; and his wife was dead.  Grethelshook her apron, and the pearls and precious stones rolled out upon thefloor, and Hansel threw down one handful after the other out of hispocket.  Then all their sorrows were ended, and they lived together ingreat happiness.My tale is done.  There runs a mouse; whoever catches her may make agreat, great cap out of her fur.THUMBLINGBy William and Jacob GrimmONCE upon a time there lived a poor peasant, who used to sit everyevening by the hearth, poking the fire, while his wife spun.  One nighthe said, "How sad it is that we have no children; everything is soquiet here, while in other houses it is so noisy and merry.""Ah!" sighed his wife, "if we had but only one, and were he no biggerthan my thumb, I should still be content, and love him with all myheart."  A little while after the wife fell ill; and after seven monthsa child was born, who, although he was perfectly formed in all hislimbs, was not actually bigger than one's thumb.  So they said to oneanother that it had happened just as they wished; and they called thechild "Thumbling."  Every day they gave him all the food he could eat;still he did not grow a bit, but remained exactly the height he waswhen first born; he looked about him, however, very knowingly, andshowed himself to be a bold and clever fellow, who prospered ineverything he undertook.One morning the peasant was making ready to go into the forest to fellwood, and said, "Now I wish I had some one who could follow me with thecart.""Oh!  father," exclaimed Thumbling, "I will bring the cart; don't youtrouble yourself; it shall be there at the right time."The father laughed at this speech, and said, "How shall that be?  Youare much too small to lead the horse by the bridle.""That matters not, father.  If mother will harness the horse, I can sitin his car, and tell him which way to take.""Well, we will try for once," said the father; and so, when the hourcame, the mother harnessed the horse, and placed Thumbling in its ear,and told him how to guide it.  Then he set out quite like a man, andthe cart went on the right road to the forest; and just as it turned acorner, and Thumbling called out "Steady, steady," two strange men metit; and one said to the other, "My goodness, what is this?  Here comesa cart, and the driver keeps calling to the horse; but I can see noone."  "That cannot be all right," said the other: "let us follow andsee where the cart stops."The cart went on safely deep into the forest, and straight to the placewhere the wood was cut.  As soon as Thumbling saw his father, he calledto him, "Here, father; here I am, you see, with the cart; just take medown."  The peasant caught the bridle of the horse with his left hand,and with his right took his little son out of its ear; and he sathimself down merrily on a straw.  When the two strangers saw the littlefellow, they knew not what to say for astonishment; and one of themtook his companion aside, and said, "This little fellow might make ourfortune if we could exhibit him in the towns.  Let us buy him."  Theywent up to the peasant, and asked, "Will you sell your son?  We willtreat him well."  "No," replied the man; "he is my heart's delight, andnot to be bought for all the money in the world!"  But Thumbling, whenhe heard what was said, climbed up by his father's skirt, and sethimself on his shoulder, and whispered in his ear, "Let me go now, andI will soon come back again."  So his father gave him to the two menfor a fine piece of gold; and they asked him where he would sit.  "Oh,"replied he, "put me on the rim of your hat; and then I can walk roundand survey the country.  I will not fall off."  They did as he wished;and when he had taken leave of his father, they set out.  Just as itwas getting dark he asked to be lifted down; and, after some demur, theman on whose hat he was, took him off and placed him on the ground.  Inan instant Thumbling ran off, and crept into a mousehole, where theycould not see him.  "Good evening, masters," said he, "you can go homewithout me"; and with a quiet laugh he crept into his hole stillfurther.  The two men poked their sticks into the hole, but all invain; for Thumbling only went down further; and when it had grown quitedark they were obliged to return home full of vexation and with emptypockets.As soon as Thumbling perceived that they were off, he crawled out ofhis hiding place, and said, "How dangerous it is to walk in this fieldin the dark: one might soon break one's head or legs;" and so saying helooked around, and by great good luck saw an empty snail shell.  "Godbe praised," he exclaimed, "here I can sleep securely; and in he went.Just as he was about to fall asleep he heard two men coming by, one ofwhom said to the other, "How shall we manage to get at the parson'sgold and silver?""That I can tell you," interrupted Thumbling."What was that?" exclaimed the thief, frightened.  "I heard some onespeak."  They stood still and listened; and then Thumbling said, "Takeme with you, and I will help you.""Where are you?" asked the thieves."Search on the ground, and mark where my voice comes from," replied he.The thief looked about, and at last found him; and lifted him up in theair."What, will you help us, you little wight?" said they."Do you not see I can creep between the iron bars into the chamber ofthe parson, and reach out to you whatever you require?""Very well; we will see what you can do," said the thief.When they came to the house, Thumbling crept into the chamber, andcried out with all his might, "Will you have all that is here?"  Thethieves were terrified, and said, "Speak gently, or some one willawake."But Thumbling feigned not to understand, and exclaimed, louder still,"Will you have all that is here?"This awoke the cook, who slept in the room, and sitting up in her bedshe listened.  The thieves, however, had run back a little way, quitefrightened; but taking courage again, and thinking the little fellowwished to tease them, they came and whispered to him to make haste andhand them out something.  At this, Thumbling cried out still moreloudly, "I will give you it all, only put your hands in."  Thelistening maid heard this clearly, and springing out of bed, hurriedout at the door.  The thieves ran off as if they were pursued by thewild huntsman, but the maid, as she could see nothing, went to strike alight.  When she returned, Thumbling escaped without being seen intothe barn, and the maid, after she had looked round and searched inevery corner, without finding anything, went to bed again, believingshe had been dreaming with her eyes open.  Meanwhile Thumbling hadcrept in amongst the hay, and found a beautiful place to sleep, wherehe intended to rest till daybreak, and then to go home to his parents.Other things however, was he to experience, for there is muchtribulation and trouble going on in this world.The maid got up at dawn of day to feed the cow.  Her first walk was tothe barn, where she took an armful of hay, and just the bundle wherepoor Thumbling lay asleep.  He slept so soundly, however, that he wasnot conscious, and only awoke when he was in the cow's mouth.  "Ah,goodness!" exclaimed he, "however came I into this mill?" but soon hesaw where he really was.  Then he took care not to come between theteeth, but presently slipped quite down the cow's throat.  "There areno windows in this room," said he to himself, "and no sunshine, and Ibrought no light with me."  Overhead his quarters seemed still worse,and more than all, he felt his room growing narrower, as the cowswallowed more hay.  So he began to call out in terror as loudly as hecould, "Bring me no more food.  I do not want any more food!" Just thenthe maid was milking the cow, and when she heard the voice withoutseeing anything, and knew it was the same she had listened to in thenight, she was so frightened that she slipped off her stool andoverturned the milk.  In great haste she ran to her master, saying,"Oh, Mr. Parson, the cow has been speaking.""You are crazy," he replied; but still he went himself into The stableto see what was the matter, and scarcely had he stepped in whenThumbling began to shout out again, "Bring me no more food, bring me nomore food."  This terrified the parson himself, and he thought an evilspirit had entered into his cow, and so ordered her to be killed.  Assoon as that was done, and they were dividing the carcass, a freshaccident befell Thumbling, for a wolf, who was passing at the time,made a snatch at the cow, and tore away the part where he was stuckfast.  However, he did not lose courage, but as soon as the wolf hadswallowed him, he called out from inside, "Oh, Mr. Wolf, I know of acapital meal for you."  "Where is it to be found?" asked the wolf"In the house by the meadow; you must creep through the gutter, andthere you will find cakes, and bacon, and sausages, as many as you caneat," replied Thumbling, describing exactly his father's house.The wolf did not wait to be told twice, but in the night crept in, andate away in the larder, to his heart's content.  When he had finished,he tried to escape by the way he entered, but the hole was not largeenough.  Thereupon Thumbling, who had reckoned on this, began to make atremendous noise inside the poor wolf, screaming and shouting as loudas he could.  "Will you be quiet?" said the wolf; "you will awake thepeople."  "Eh, what!" cried the little man, "since you have satisfiedyourself, it is my turn now to make merry;" and he set up a louderhowling than before.  At last his father and mother awoke, and came tothe room and looked through the chinks of the door; and as soon as theyperceived the ravages the wolf had committed, they ran and brought theman his ax and the woman the scythe.  "Stop you behind," said the man,as they entered the room; "if my blow does not kill him, you must givehim a cut with your weapon, and chop off his head if you can."When Thumbling heard his father's voice, he called out, "Father dear, Iam here, in the wolf's body!"  "Heaven be praised," said the man, fullof joy, "our dear child is found again;" and he bade his wife take awaythe scythe, lest it should do any harm to his son.  Then he raised hisax, and gave the wolf such a blow on its head that it fell dead, and,taking a knife, he cut it open and released the little fellow, his son."Ah," said his father, "what trouble we have had about you."  "Yes,father," replied Thumbling, "I have been traveling a great deal aboutthe world.  Heaven be praised!  I breathe fresh air again.""Where have you been, my son?" he inquired."Once I was in a mouse's hole, once inside a cow, and lastly insidethat wolf; and now I will stop here with you," said Thumbling."Yes," said the old people, "we will not sell you again for all theriches of the world;" and they embraced and kissed him with greataffection.  Then they gave him plenty to eat and drink, and had newclothes made for him, for his old ones were worn out with traveling.THE SIX SWANSBy William and Jacob GrimmA KING was once hunting in a large wood, and pursued his game so hotly,that none of his courtiers could follow him.  But when eveningapproached he stopped, and looking around him perceived that he hadlost himself.  He sought a path out of the forest, but could not findone, and presently he saw an old woman with a nodding head, who came upto him.  "My good woman," said he to her, "can you not show me the wayout of the forest?"  "Oh, yes, my lord King," she replied, "I can dothat very well, but upon one condition, which if you do not fulfill youwill never again get out of the wood, but will die of hunger.""What, then, is this condition?" asked the King."I have a daughter," said the old woman, "who is as beautiful as anyoneyou can find in the whole world, and well deserves to be your bride.Now, if you will make her your Queen, I will show you your way out ofthe wood."  In the anxiety of his heart the King consented, and the oldwoman led him to her cottage, where the daughter was sitting by a fire.She received the King as if she had expected him, and he saw at oncethat she was very beautiful, but yet she did not quite please him, forhe could not look at her without a secret shuddering.  However, afterall, he took the maiden up on his horse, and the old woman showed himthe way, and the King arrived safely at his palace, where the weddingwas to be celebrated.The King had been married once before, and had seven children by hisfirst wife, six boys and a girl, whom he loved above everything else inthe world.  He became afraid, soon, that the stepmother might not treatthem very well, and might even do them some great injury, so he tookthem away to a lonely castle which stood in the midst of a forest.This castle was so hidden, and the way to it so difficult to discover,that he himself could not have found it if a wise woman had not givenhim a ball of cotton which had the wonderful property, when he threw itbefore him, of unrolling itself and showing him the right path.  TheKing went, however, so often to see his dear children, that the Queennoticed his absence, became inquisitive, and wished to know what hewent to fetch out of the forest.  So she gave his servants a greatquantity of money, and they disclosed to her the secret, and also toldher of the ball of cotton which alone could show the way.  She had nowno peace until she discovered where this ball was concealed, and thenshe made some fine silken shirts, and, as she had learned of hermother, she sewed within each one a charm.  One day soon after, whenthe King was gone out hunting, she took the little shirts and went intothe forest, and the cotton showed her the path.  The children, seeingsome one coming in the distance, thought it was their dear father, andran out toward her full of joy.  Then she threw over each of them ashirt, which as it touched their bodies changed them into Swans, whichflew away over the forest.  The Queen then went home quite contented,and thought she was free of her stepchildren; but the little girl hadnot met her with the brothers, and the Queen did not know of her.The following day the King went to visit his children, but he foundonly the maiden.  "Where are your brothers?" asked he.  "Ah, dearfather," she replied, "they are gone away and have left me alone;" andshe told him how she had looked out of the window and seen them changedinto Swans, which had flown over the forest; and then she showed himthe feathers which they had dropped in the courtyard, and which she hadcollected together.  The King was much grieved, but he did not thinkthat his wife could have done this wicked deed, and, as he feared thegirl might also be stolen away, he took her with him.  She was,however, so much afraid of the stepmother, that she begged him not tostop more than one night in the castle.The poor maiden thought to herself: "This is no longer my place, I willgo and seek my brothers;" and when night came she escaped and wentquite deep into the wood.  She walked all night long and great part ofthe next day, until she could go no further from weariness.  Just thenshe saw a rude hut, and walking in she found a room with six littlebeds, but she dared not get into one, but crept under, and, layingherself upon the hard earth, prepared to pass the night there.  Just asthe sun was setting, she heard a rustling, and saw six white Swans comeflying in at the window.  They settled on the ground and began blowingone another until they had blown all their feathers off, and theirswan's down stripped off like a shirt.  Then the maiden knew them atonce for her brothers, and gladly crept out from under the bed, and thebrothers were not less glad to see their sister, but their joy was ofshort duration.  "Here you must not stay," said they to her; "this is arobber's hiding-place; if they should return and find you here, theywill murder you."  "Can you not protect me, then?" inquired the sister."No," they replied, "for we can only lay aside our swan's feathers fora quarter of an hour each evening, and for that time we retain ourhuman form, but afterward we resume our usual appearance."Their sister then asked them with tears, "Can you not be restoredagain?""Oh, no," replied they, "the conditions are too difficult.  For sixlong years you must neither speak nor laugh, and during that time youmust sew together for us six little shirts of star flowers, and shouldthere fall a single word from your lips, then all your labor will bevain."  Just as the brother finished speaking, the quarter of an hourelapsed, and they all flew out of the window again like Swans.The little sister, however, made a solemn resolution to rescue herbrothers or die in the attempt; and she left the cottage, and,penetrating deep into the forest, passed the night amid the branches ofa tree.  The next morning she went out and collected the star flowersto sew together.  She had no one to converse with, and as for laughingshe had no spirits, so there up in the tree she sat, intent only uponher work.  After she had passed some time there, it happened that theKing of that country was hunting in the forest, and his huntsmen camebeneath the tree on which the maiden sat.  They called to her andasked, "Who art thou?"  But she gave no answer.  "Come down to us,"continued they, "we will do thee no harm."  She simply shook her head,and, when they pressed her further with questions, she threw down tothem her gold necklace, hoping therewith to satisfy them.  They didnot, however, leave her, and she threw down her girdle, but in vain;and even her rich dress did not make them desist.  At last the hunterhimself climbed the tree and brought down the maiden and took herbefore the King.  The King asked her, "Who art thou?  What dost thouupon that tree?  But she did not answer, and then he asked her, in allthe languages that he knew, but she remained dumb to all, as a fish.Since, however, she was so beautiful, the King's heart was touched, andhe conceived for her a strong affection.  Then he put around her hiscloak, and, placing her before him on his horse, took her to hiscastle.  There he ordered rich clothing to be made for her, and,although her beauty shone as the sun-beams, not a word escaped her.The King placed her by his side at table, and there her dignified mienand manners so won upon him, that he said, "This maiden will I tomarry, and no other in the world," and after some days he was united toher.Now, the King had a wicked stepmother who was discontented with hismarriage, and spoke evil of the young Queen.  "Who knows whence thewench comes?" said she.  "She who cannot speak is not worthy of aKing."  A year after, when the Queen brought her first-born son intothe world, the old woman took him away.  Then she went to the King andcomplained that the Queen was a murderess.  The King, however, wouldnot believe it, and suffered no one to do any injury to his wife, whosat composedly sewing at her shirts and paying attention to nothingelse.  When a second child was born, the false stepmother used the samedeceit, but the King again would not listen to her words, but said,"She is too pious and good to act so: could she but speak and defendherself, her innocence would come to light."  But when again the thirdtime the old woman stole away the child, and then accused the Queen,who answered her not a word to the accusation, the King was obliged togive her up to be tried, and she was condemned to suffer death by fire.When the time had elapsed, and the sentence was to be carried out,during which she had neither spoken nor laughed, it was the very daywhen her dear brothers should be made free; the six shirts were alsoready, all but the last, which yet wanted the left sleeve.  As she wasled to the scaffold she placed the shirts upon her arm, and just as shehad mounted it, and the fire was about to be kindled, she looked round,and saw six Swans come flying through the air.  Her heart leaped forjoy as she perceived her deliverers approaching, and soon the Swans,flying toward her, alighted so near that she was enabled to throw overthem the shirts, and as soon as she had so done their feathers fell offand the brothers stood up alive and well; but the youngest wanted hisleft arm, instead of which he had a swan's wing.  They embraced andkissed each other, and the Queen going to the King, who wasthunderstruck, began to say, "Now may I speak, my dear husband, andprove to you that I am innocent and falsely accused;" and then she toldhim how the wicked old woman had stolen away and hidden her threechildren.  When she had concluded, the King was overcome with joy, andthe wicked stepmother was led to the scaffold and bound to the stakeand burned to ashes.The King and the Queen forever after lived in peace and prosperity withtheir six brothers.SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-REDBy William and Jacob GrimmTHERE was once a poor Widow who lived alone in her hut with her twochildren, who were called Snow-White and Rose-Red, because they werelike the flowers which bloomed on two rosebushes which grew before thecottage.  But they were two as pious, good, industrious, and amiablechildren as any that were in the world, only Snow-White was more quietand gentle than Rose-Red.  For Rose-Red would run and jump about themeadows, seeking flowers and catching butterflies, while Snow-White satat home helping her Mother to keep house, or reading to her if therewere nothing else to do.  The two children loved one another dearly,and always walked hand in hand when they went out together; and everwhen they talked of it they agreed that they would never separate fromeach other, and that whatever one had the other should share.  Oftenthey ran deep into the forest and gathered wild berries; but no beastever harmed them.  For the hare would eat cauliflowers out of theirhands, the fawn would graze at their side, the goats would frisk aboutthem in play, and the birds remained perched on the boughs singing asif nobody were near.  No accident ever befell them; and if they stayedlate in the forest, and night came upon them, they used to lie down onthe moss and sleep till morning; and because their Mother knew theywould do so, she felt no concern about them.  One time when they hadthus passed the night in the forest, and the dawn of morning awokethem, they saw a beautiful Child dressed in shining white sitting neartheir couch.  She got up and looked at them kindly, but without sayinganything went into the forest; and when the children looked round theysaw that where they had slept was close to the edge of a pit, intowhich they would have certainly fallen had they walked a couple ofsteps further in the dark.  Their Mother told them the figure they hadseen was doubtless the good angel who watches over children.Snow-White and Rose-Red kept their Mother's cottage so clean that itwas a pleasure to enter it.  Every morning in the summer time Rose-Redwould first put the house in order, and then gather a nosegay for herMother, in which she always placed a bud from each rose tree.  Everywinter's morning Snow-White would light the fire and put the kettle onto boil, and although the kettle was made of copper it yet shone likegold, because it was scoured so well.  In the evenings, when the flakesof snow were falling, the Mother would say: "Go, Snow-White, and boltthe door;" and then they used to sit down on the hearth, and the Motherwould put on her spectacles and read out of a great book while herchildren sat spinning.  By their side, too, laid a little lamb, and ona perch behind them a little white dove reposed with her head under herwing.One evening, when they were thus sitting comfortably together, therecame a knock at the door as if somebody wished to come in.  "Makehaste, Rose-Red," cried her Mother; "make haste and open the door;perhaps there is some traveler outside who needs shelter."  So Rose-Redwent and drew the bolt and opened the door, expecting to see some poorman outside, but instead, a great fat Bear poked his black head in.Rose-Red shrieked out and ran back, the little lamb bleated, the dovefluttered on her perch, and Snow-White hid herself behind her Mother'sbed.  The Bear, however, began to speak, and said: "Be not afraid, Iwill do you no harm; but I am half frozen, and wish to come in and warmmyself.""Poor Bear!" cried the Mother; "come in and lie down before the fire;but take care you do not burn your skin;" and then she continued: "Comehere, Rose-Red and Snow-White, the Bear will not harm you, he meanshonorably."  So they both came back, and by degrees the lamb too andthe dove overcame their fears and welcomed the rough visitor."You children!" said the Bear, before he entered, "come and knock thesnow off my coat."  And they fetched their brooms and swept him clean.Then he stretched himself before the fire and grumbled out hissatisfaction; and in a little while the children became familiar enoughto play tricks with the unwieldy animal.  They pulled his long, shaggyskin, set their feet upon his back and rolled him to and fro, and evenventured to beat him with a hazel stick, laughing when he grumbled.The Bear bore all their tricks good temperedly, and if they hit him toohard he cried out:"Leave me my life, you children,Snow-White and Rose-Red,Or you'll never wed."When bedtime came and the others were gone, the Mother said to theBear: "You may sleep here on the hearth if you like, and then you willbe safely protected from the cold and bad weather."As soon as day broke the two children let the Bear out again, and hetrotted away over the snow, and ever afterward he came every evening ata certain hour.  He would lie down on the hearth and allow the childrento play with him as much as they liked, till by degrees they became soaccustomed to him that the door was left unbolted till their blackfriend arrived.But as soon as spring returned, and everything out of doors was greenagain, the Bear one morning told Snow-White that he must leave her, andcould not return during the whole summer.  "Where are you going, then,dear Bear?" asked Snow-White, "I am obliged to go into the forest andguard my treasures from the evil Dwarfs; for in winter, when the groundis hard, they are obliged to keep in their holes, and cannot workthrough; but now, since the sun has thawed the earth and warmed it, theDwarf's pierce through, and steal all they can find; and what has oncepassed into their hands, and gets concealed by them in their caves, isnot easily brought to light."  Snow-White, however, was very sad at thedeparture of the Bear, and opened the door so hesitatingly that when hepressed through it he left behind on the sneck a piece of his hairycoat; and through the hole which was made in his coat Snow-Whitefancied she saw the glittering of gold; but she was not quite certainof it.  The Bear, however, ran hastily away, and was soon hidden behindthe trees.Some time afterward the Mother sent the children into the wood togather sticks; and while doing so, they came to a tree which was lyingacross the path, on the trunk of which something kept bobbing up anddown from the grass, and they could not imagine what it was.  When theycame nearer they saw a Dwarf, with an old wrinkled face and a snow-white beard a yard long.  The end of this beard was fixed in a split ofthe tree, and the little man kept jumping about like a dog tied by achain, for he did not know how to free himself.  He glared at theMaidens with his red fiery eyes, and exclaimed, "Why do you standthere?  are you going to pass without offering me any assistance?""What have you done, little man?" asked Rose-Red.  "You stupid, gapinggoose!" exclaimed he.  "I wanted to have split the tree, in order toget a little wood for my kitchen, for the little wood which we use issoon burned up with great fagots, not like what you rough, greedypeople devour!  I had driven the wedge in properly, and everything wasgoing on well, when the smooth wood flew upward, and the tree closed sosuddenly together that I could not draw my beautiful beard out, andhere it sticks and I cannot get away.  There, don't laugh, you milk-faced things!  are you dumfounded?"The children took all the pains they could to pull the Dwarf's beardout; but without success.  "I will run and fetch some help," criedRose-Red at length."Crack-brained sheep's head that you are!" snarled the Dwarf; "what areyou going to call other people for?  You are two too many now for me;can you think of nothing else?""Don't be impatient," replied Snow-White; "I have thought ofsomething;" and pulling her scissors out of her pocket she cut off theend of the beard.  As soon as the Dwarf found himself at liberty, hesnatched up his sack, which lay between the roots of the tree, filledwith gold, and throwing it over his shoulder marched off, grumbling andgroaning and crying: "Stupid people!  to cut off a piece of mybeautiful beard.  Plague take you!" and away he went without oncelooking at the children.Some time afterward Snow-White and Rose-Red went a-fishing, and as theyneared the pond they saw something like a great locust hopping about onthe bank, as if going to jump into the water.  They ran up andrecognized the Dwarf.  "What are you after?" asked Rose-Red; "you willfall into the water."  "I am not quite such a simpleton as that,"replied the Dwarf: "but do you not see this fish will pull me in?"  Thelittle man had been sitting there angling, and unfortunately the windhad entangled his beard with the fishing line; and so, when a greatfish bit at the bait, the strength of the weak little fellow was notable to draw it out, and the fish had the best of the struggle.  TheDwarf held on by the reeds and rushes which grew near; but to nopurpose, for the fish pulled him where it liked, and he must soon havebeen drawn into the pond.  Luckily just then the two Maidens arrived,and tried to release the beard of the Dwarf from the fishing line; butboth were too closely entangled for it to be done.  So the Maidenpulled out her scissors again and cut off another piece of the beard.When the Dwarf saw this done he was in a great rage, and exclaimed:"You donkey!  that is the way to disfigure my face.  Was it not enoughto cut it once, but you must now take away the best part of my finebeard?  I dare not show myself again now to my own people.  I wish youhad run the soles off your boots before you had come here!"  So saying,he took up a bag of pearls which lay among the rushes, and withoutspeaking another word, slipped off and disappeared behind a stone.Not many days after this adventure, it chanced that the Mother sent thetwo Maidens to the next town to buy thread, needles and pins, laces andribbons.  Their road passed over a common, on which here and theregreat pieces of rock were lying about.  Just over their heads they sawa great bird flying round and round, and every now and then, droppinglower and lower, till at last it flew down behind a rock.  Immediatelyafterward they heard a piercing shriek, and running up they saw withaffright that the eagle had caught their old acquaintance.  the Dwarf,and was trying to carry him off.  The compassionate children thereuponlaid hold of the little man, and held him fast till the bird gave upthe struggle and flew off.  As soon then as the Dwarf had recoveredfrom his fright, he exclaimed in his squeaking voice: "Could you nothold me more gently?  You have seized my fine brown coat in such amanner that it is all torn and full of holes, meddling and interferingrubbish that you are!"  With these words he shouldered a bag filledwith precious stones, and slipped away to his cave among the rocks.The maidens were now accustomed to his ingratitude, and so they walkedon to the town and transacted their business there.  Coming home, theyreturned over the same common, and unawares walked up to a certainclean spot on which the Dwarf had shaken out his bag of preciousstones, thinking nobody was near.  The sun was shining, and the brightstones glittered in its beams and displayed such a variety of colorsthat the two Maidens stopped to admire them."What are you standing there gaping for?" asked the Dwarf, while hisface grew as red as copper with rage; he was continuing to abuse thepoor Maidens, when a loud roaring noise was heard, and presently agreat black Bear came rolling out of the forest.  The Dwarf jumped upterrified, but he could not gain his retreat before the Bear overtookhim.  Thereupon, he cried out: "Spare me, my dear Lord Bear!  I willgive you all my treasures.  See these beautiful precious stones whichlie here; only give me my life; for what have you to fear from a littleweak fellow like me?  you could not touch me with your big teeth.There are two wicked girls, take them; they would make nice morsels, asfat as young quails; eat them for heaven's sake."The Bear, however, without troubling himself to speak, gave the bad-hearted Dwarf a single blow with his paw, and he never stirred after.The Maidens were then going to run away, but the Bear called afterthem: "Snow-White and Rose-Red, fear not!  wait a bit and I willaccompany you."  They recognized his voice and stopped; and when theBear came, his rough coat suddenly fell off, and he stood up a tallman, dressed entirely in gold.  "I am a king's son," he said, "and wascondemned by the wicked Dwarf, who stole all my treasures, to wanderabout in this forest, in the form of a bear, till his death releasedme.  Now he has received his well-deserved punishment."Then they went home, and Snow-White was married to the prince, andRose-Red to his brother, with whom they shared the immense treasurewhich the Dwarf had collected.  The old Mother also lived for manyyears happily with her two children, and the rose trees which had stoodbefore the cottage were planted now before the palace, and producedevery year beautiful red and white roses.THE UGLY DUCKLINGBy Hans Christian AndersenIT was so glorious out in the country; it was summer; the cornfieldswere yellow, the oats were green, the hay had been put up in stacks inthe green meadows, and the stork went about on his long red legs, andchattered Egyptian, for this was the language he had learned from hisgood mother.  All around the fields and meadows were great forests, andin the midst of these forests lay deep lakes.  Yes, it was rightglorious out in the country.  In the midst of the sunshine there lay anold farm, with deep canals about it, and from the wall down to thewater grew great burdocks, so high that little children could standupright under the loftiest of them.  It was just as wild there as inthe deepest wood, and here sat a Duck upon her nest; she had to hatchher ducklings; but she was almost tired out before the little onescame; and then she so seldom had visitors.  The other ducks likedbetter to swim about in the canals than to run up to sit down under aburdock, and cackle with her.At last one egg-shell after another burst open.  "Piep!  piep!" itcried, and in all the eggs there were little creatures that stuck outtheir heads."Quack!  quack!" they said; and they all came quacking out as fast asthey could, looking all round them under the green leaves; and themother let them look as much as they chose, for green is good for theeye."How wide the world is!" said all the young ones, for they certainlyhad much more room now than when they were in the eggs."D'ye think this is all the world?" said the mother.  "That stretchesfar across the other side of the garden, quite into the parson's field;but I have never been there yet.  I hope you are all together," and shestood up.  "No, I have not all.  The largest egg still lies there.  Howlong is that to last?  I am really tired of it." And she sat downagain."Well, how goes it?" asked an old Duck who had come to pay her a visit."It lasts a long time with that one egg," said the Duck who sat there."It will not burst.  Now, only look at the others; are they not theprettiest little ducks one could possibly see?  They are all like theirfather: the rogue, he never comes to see me.""Let me see the egg which will not burst," said the old visitor.  "Youmay be sure it is a turkey's egg.  I was once cheated in that way, andhad much anxiety and trouble with the young ones, for they are afraidof the water.  Must I say it to you, I could not get them to venturein.  I quacked and I clacked, but it was no use.  Let me see the egg.Yes, that's a turkey's egg.  Let it lie there, and teach the otherchildren to swim.""I think I will sit on it a little longer," said the Duck.  "I've satso long now that I can sit a few days more.""Just as you please," said the old Duck; and she went away.At last the great egg burst.  "Piep!  piep!" said the little one, andcrept forth, it was very large and very ugly.  The Duck looked at it."It's a very large duckling," said she; "none of the others look likethat: can it really be a turkey chick?  Well, we shall soon find out.It must go into the water, even if I have to thrust it in myself."The next day, it was bright, beautiful weather; the sun shone on allthe green trees.  The Mother Duck went down to the canal with all herfamily.  Splash!  she jumped into the water.  "Quack!  quack!" shesaid, and one duckling after another plunged in.  The water closed overtheir heads, but they came up in an instant, and swam capitally; theirlegs went of themselves, and they were all in the water.  The ugly grayDuckling swam with them."No, it's not a turkey," said she; "look how well it can use its legs,and how straight it holds itself.  It is my own child!  On the wholeit's quite pretty, if one looks at it rightly.  Quack!  quack!  comewith me, and I'll lead you out into the great world, and present you inthe duckyard; but keep close to me, so that no one may tread on you,and take care of the cats!"And so they came into the duckyard.  There was a terrible riot, goingon in there, for two families were quarreling about an eel's head, andthe cat got it after all."See, that's how it goes in the world!" said the Mother Duck; and shewhetted her beak, for she too wanted the eel's head.  "Only use yourlegs," she said.  "See that you can bustle about, and bow your headsbefore the old Duck yonder.  She's the grandest of all here; she's ofSpanish blood-that's why she's so fat; and d'ye see she has a red raground her leg; that's something particularly fine, and the greatestdistinction a duck can enjoy; it signifies that one does not want tolose her, and that she's to be known by the animals and by men too.Shake yourselves-don't turn in your toes; a well-brought-up duck turnsits toes quite out, just like father and mother-so!  Now bend yournecks and say 'Quack!'"And they did so: but the other ducks round about looked at them, andsaid quite boldly:"Look there!  now we're to have these hanging on, as if there were notenough of us already! And- fie!-how that Duckling yonder looks; wewon't stand that!"  And one duck flew up at it, and bit it in the neck."Let it alone," said the mother: "it does no harm to anyone.""Yes, but it's too large and peculiar," said the Duck who had bittenit; "and therefore it must be put down.""Those are pretty children that the mother has there," said the oldDuck with the rag round her leg.  They're all pretty but that one; thatwas rather unlucky.  I wish she could bear it over again.""That cannot be done, my lady," replied the Mother Duck.  "It is notpretty, but it has a really good disposition, and swims as well as anyother; yes, I may even say it, swims better.  I think it will grow uppretty, and become smaller in time; it has lain too long in the egg,and therefore is not properly shaped."  And then she pinched it in theneck, and smoothed its feathers.  Moreover it is a drake," she said,"and therefore it is not so much consequence.  I think he will be verystrong: he makes his way already.""The other duckling's are graceful enough," said the old Duck.  "Makeyourself at home; and if you find an eel's head, you may bring it tome."And now they were at home.  But the poor Duckling which had crept lastout of the egg, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and jeered,as much by the ducks as by the chickens."It is too big!" they all said.  And the turkey cock, who had been bornwith spurs, and therefore thought himself an emperor, blew himself uplike a ship in full sail, and bore straight down upon it; then hegobbled and grew quite red in the face.  The poor Duckling did not knowwhere it should stand or walk; it was quite melancholy because itlooked ugly, and was the butt of the whole duckyard.So it went on the first day; and afterward it became worse and worse.The poor Duckling was hunted about by everyone: even its brothers andsisters were quite angry with it, and said: "If the cat would onlycatch you, you ugly creature!"  And the mother said: "If you were onlyfar away!"  And the ducks hit it, and the chickens beat it, and thegirl who had to feed the poultry kicked at it with her foot.Then it ran and flew over the fence, and the little birds in the bushesflew up in fear."That is because I am so ugly!" thought the Duckling; and it shut itseyes, but flew on further; and so it came out into the great moor,where the wild ducks lived.  Here it lay the whole night long; and itwas weary and downcast.Toward morning the wild chicks flew up, and looked at their newcompanion."What sort of a one are you?" they asked; and the Duckling turned inevery direction, and bowed as well as it could.  You are remarkablyugly!" said the Wild Ducks.  "But that is nothing to us, so long as youdo not marry into our family."Poor thing!  it certainly did not think of marrying, and only hoped toobtain leave to lie among the reeds and drink some of the swamp water.Thus it lay two whole days; then came thither two wild geese, or,properly speaking, two wild ganders.  It was not long since each hadcrept out of an egg, and that's why they were so saucy."Listen, comrade," said one of them.  "You're so ugly that I like you.Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage?  Near here, inanother moor, there are a few sweet lovely geese, all unmarried, andall able to say 'Rap?'  You've a chance of' making your fortune, uglyas you are.""Piff!  paff!" resounded through the air; and the two ganders fell downdead in the swamp, and the water became blood red.  "Piff paff!" itsounded again, and the whole flock of wild geese rose up from thereeds.  And then there was another report.  A great hunt was going on.The sportsmen were lying in wait all round the moor, and some were evensitting up in the branches of the trees, which spread far over thereeds.  The blue smoke rose up like clouds among the dark trees, andwas wafted far away across the water; and the hunting dogs came-splash,splash!-into the swamp, and the rushes and the reeds bent down on everyside.  That was a fright for the poor Duckling!  It turned its head,and put it under its wing; but at that moment a frightful great dogstood close by the Duckling.  His tongue hung far out of his mouth, andhis eyes gleamed horrible and ugly; he thrust out his nose closeagainst the Duckling, showed his Sharp teeth, and-splash, splash!-on hewent, without seizing it."O, Heaven be thanked!" sighed the Duckling.  "I am so ugly, that eventhe dog does not like to bite me!"And so it lay quite quiet, while the shots rattled through the reedsand gun after gun was fired.  At last, late in the day, all was still;but the poor Duckling did not dare to rise up; it waited several hoursbefore it looked round, and then hastened away out of the moor as fastit could.  It ran on over field and meadow; there was such a stormraging that it was difficult to get from one place to another.Toward evening the Duck came to a little miserable peasant's hut.  Thishut was so dilapidated that it did not itself know on which side itshould fall; and that's why it remained standing.  The storm whistledround the Duckling in such a way that the poor creature was obliged tosit down, to stand against it; and the wind blew worse and worse.  Thenthe Duckling noticed that one of the hinges of the door had given way,and the door hung so slanting that the Duckling could slip through thecrack into the room; and that is what it did.Here lived a woman, with her Cat and her Hen.  And the Cat, whom shecalled Sonnie, could arch his back and purr, he could even give outsparks; but for that one had to stroke his fur the wrong way.  The Henhad quite little short legs, and therefore she was called ChickabiddyShortshanks; she laid good eggs, and the woman loved her as her ownchild.In the morning the strange Duckling was at once noticed, and the Catbegan to purr and the Hen to cluck."What's this?" said the woman, and looked all round; but she could notsee well, and therefore she thought the Duckling was a fat duck thathad strayed.  "This is a rare prize!" she said, "Now I shall haveducks' eggs.  I hope it is not a drake.  We must try that."And so the Duckling was admitted on trial for three weeks; but no eggscame.  And the Cat was master of the house, and the Hen was the lady,and always said "We and the world!" for she thought they were half theworld, and by far the better half.  The Duckling thought one might havea different opinion, but the Hen would not allow it."Can you lay eggs?" she asked."No.""Then will you hold your tongue!"And the Cat said, "Can you curve your back, and purr, and give outsparks?""No.""Then you will please have no opinion of your own when sensible folksare speaking.And the Duckling sat in a corner and was melancholy; then the fresh airand the sunshine streamed in; and it was seized with such a strangelonging to swim on the water, that it could not help telling the Hen ofit."What are you thinking of?" cried the Hen.  "You have nothing to do,that's why you have these fancies.  Lay eggs, or purr, and they willpass over.""But it is so charming to swim on the water!" said the Duckling, "sorefreshing to let it close over one's head, and to dive down to thebottom.""Yes, that must be a mighty pleasure, truly," quoth the Hen.  "I fancyyou must have gone crazy.  Ask the Cat about it-he's the cleverestanimal I know-ask him if he likes to swim on the water, or to divedown: I won't speak about myself.  Ask our mistress, the old woman; noone in the world is cleverer than she.  Do you think she has any desireto swim, and to let the water close above her head?""You don't understand me," said the Duckling."We don't understand you?  Then pray who is to understand you?  Yousurely don't pretend to be cleverer than the Cat and the woman-I won'tsay anything of myself.  Don't be conceited, child, and thank yourMaker for all the kindness you have received.  Did you not get into awarm room, and have you not fallen into company from which you maylearn something?  But you are a chatterer, and it is not pleasant toassociate with you.  You may believe me, I speak for your good.  I tellyou disagreeable things, and by that one may always know one's truefriends!  Only take care that you learn to lay eggs, or to purr, andgive out sparks!""I think I will go out into the wide world," said the Duckling."Yes, do go," replied the Hen.And so the Duckling went away.  It swam on the water, and dived, but itwas slighted by every creature because of its ugliness.Now came the autumn.  The leaves in the forest turned yellow and brown;the wind caught them so that they danced about, and up in the air itwas very cold.  The clouds hung low, heavy with hail and snowflakes,and on the fence stood the raven, crying, "Croak!  croak!" for merecold; yes, it was enough to make one feel cold to think of this.  Thepoor little Duckling certainly had not a good time.  One evening-thesun was just setting in his beauty-there came a whole flock of great,handsome birds out of the bushes; they were dazzlingly white, withlong, flexible necks; they were swans.  They uttered a very peculiarcry, spread forth their glorious great wings, and flew away from thatcold region to warmer lands, to fair open lakes.  They mounted so high,so high!  and the ugly Duckling felt quite strangely as it watchedthem.  It turned round and round in the water like a wheel, stretchedout its neck toward them, and uttered such a strange, loud cry asfrightened itself.  Oh!  it could not forget those beautiful, happybirds; and so soon as it could see them no longer, it dived down to thevery bottom, and when it came up again, it was quite beside itself.  Itknew not the name of those birds, and knew not whither they wereflying; but it loved them more than it had ever loved anyone.  It wasnot at all envious of them.  How could it think of wishing to possesssuch loveliness as they had?  It would have been glad if only the duckswould have endured its company the poor, ugly creature!And the winter grew cold, very cold!  The Duckling was forced to swimabout in the water, to prevent the surface from freezing entirely; butevery night the hole in which it swam about became smaller and smaller.It froze so hard that the icy covering crackled again; and the Ducklingwas obliged to use its legs continually to prevent the hole fromfreezing up.  At last it became exhausted, and lay quite still, andthus froze fast into the ice.  Early in the morning a peasant came by,and when he saw what had happened, he took his wooden shoe, broke theice crust to pieces, and carried the Duckling home to his wife.  Thenit came to itself again.  The children wanted to play with it; but theDuckling thought they wanted to hurt it, and in its terror fluttered upinto the milk pan, so that the milk spurted down into the room.  Thewoman clasped her hands, at which the Duckling flew down into thebutter tub, and then into the meal barrel and out again.  How it lookedthen!  The woman screamed, and struck at it with the fire tongs; thechildren tumbled over one another in their efforts to catch theDuckling; and they laughed and they screamed!-well it was that the doorstood open, and the poor creature was able to slip out between theshrubs into the newly fallen snow-there it lay quite exhausted.But it would be too melancholy if I were to tell all the misery andcare which the Duckling had to endure in the hard winter.  It lay outon the moor among the reeds, when the sun began to shine again and thelarks to sing: it was a beautiful spring.Then all at once the Duckling could flap its wings: they beat the airmore strongly than before, and bore it strongly away; and before itwell knew how all this happened, it found itself in a great garden,where the elder trees smelled sweet, and bent their long green branchesdown to the canal that wound through the region.  Oh, here it was sobeautiful, such a gladness of spring!  and from the thicket came threeglorious white swans; they rustled their wings, and swam lightly on thewater.  The Duckling knew the splendid creatures, and felt oppressed bya peculiar sadness."I will fly away to them, to the royal birds!  and they will beat me,because I, that am so ugly, dare to come near them.  But it is all thesame.  Better to be killed by them than to be pursued by ducks, andbeaten by fowls, and pushed about by the girl who takes care of thepoultry yard, and to suffer hunger in winter!"  And it flew out intothe water, and swam toward the beautiful swans: these looked at it, andcame sailing down upon it with outspread wings.  "Kill me!" said thepoor creature, and bent its head down upon the water, expecting nothingbut death.  But what was this that it saw in the clear water?  Itbeheld its own image; and, lo!  it was no longer a clumsy, dark-graybird, ugly and hateful to look at, but a-swan!It matters nothing if one is born in a duck yard, if one has only lainin a swan's egg.It felt quite glad at all the need and misfortune it had suffered, nowit realized its happiness in all the splendor that surrounded it.  Andthe great swans swam round it, and stroked it with their beaks.Into the garden came little children, who threw bread and corn into thewater; and the youngest cried, "There is a new one!" and the otherchildren shouted joyously, "Yes, a new one has arrived!"  And theyclapped their hands and danced about, and ran to their father andmother; and bread and cake were thrown into the water; and they allsaid, "The new one is the most beautiful of all so young and handsome!"and the old swans bowed their heads before him.Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wings, for hedid not know what to do; he was so happy, and yet not at all proud.  Hethought how he had been persecuted and despised; and now he heard themsaying that he was the most beautiful of all birds.  Even the eldertree bent its branches straight down into the water before him, and thesun shone warm and mild.  Then his wings rustled, he lifted his slenderneck, and cried rejoicingly from the depths of his heart:"I never dreamed of so much happiness when I was the Ugly Duckling!"THE TINDER-BOXBy Hans Christian AndersenTHERE came a soldier marching along the high road-one, two!  one, two!He had his knapsack on his back and a saber by his side, for he hadbeen in the wars, and now he wanted to go home.  And on the way he metwith an old Witch: she was very hideous and her under lip hung downupon her breast.  She said: "Good evening, Soldier.  What a fine swordyou have, and what a big knapsack!  You're a proper soldier!  Now youshall have as much money as you like to have.""I thank you, you old Witch" said the Soldier."Do you see that great tree?" quoth the Witch; and she pointed to atree which stood beside them."It's quite hollow inside.  You must climb to the top, and then you'llsee a hole, through which you can let yourself down and get deep intothe tree.  I'll tie a rope round your body, so that I can pull you upagain when you call me.""What am I to do down in the tree?" asked the Soldier."Get money," replied the Witch.  "Listen to me.  When you come down tothe earth under the tree, you will find yourself in a great hall: it isquite light, for above three hundred lamps are burning there.  Then youwill see three doors; these you can open, for the keys are hangingthere.  If you go into the first chamber, you'll see a great chest inthe middle of the floor; on this chest sits a dog, and he's got a pairof eyes as big as two teacups.  But you need not care for that.  I'llgive you my blue-checked apron, and you can spread it out upon thefloor; then go up quickly and take the dog, and set him on my apron;then open the chest, and take as many shillings as you like.  They areof copper; if you prefer silver, you must go into the second chamber.But there sits a dog with a pair of eyes as big as mill wheels.  But donot you care for that.  Set him upon my apron, and take some of themoney.  And if you want gold, you can have that too-in fact, as much asyou can carry-if you go into the third chamber.  But the dog that sitson the money chest there has two eyes as big as round towers.  He is afierce dog, you may be sure; but you needn't be afraid, for all that.Only set him on my apron, and he won't hurt you; and take out of thechest as much gold as you like.""That's not so bad," said the Soldier.  "But what am I to give you, youold Witch?  for you will not do it for nothing, I fancy.""No," replied the Witch, "not a single shilling will I have.  You shallonly bring me an old Tinder-box which my grandmother forgot when shewas down there last.""Then tie the rope round my body," cried the Soldier."Here it is," said the Witch, "and here's my blue-checked apron."Then the Soldier climbed up into the tree, let himself slip down intothe hole, and stood, as the Witch had said, in the great hall where thethree hundred lamps were burning.Now he opened the first door.  Ugh!  there sat the dog with eyes as bigas teacups, staring at him."You're a nice fellow!" exclaimed the Soldier; and he set him on theWitch's apron, and took as many shillings as his pockets would hold,and then locked the chest, set the dog on it again, and went into thesecond chamber, Aha!  there sat the dog with eyes as big as millwheels."You should not stare so hard at me," said the Soldier; "you mightstrain your eyes." And he set the dog upon the Witch's apron.  And whenhe saw the silver money in the chest, he threw away all the coppermoney he had and filled his pockets and his knapsack with silver only.Then he went into the third chamber.  Oh, but that was horrid!  The dogthere really had eyes as big as towers, and they turned round and roundin his head like wheels."Good evening!" said the Soldier; and he touched his cap, for he hadnever seen such a dog as that before.  When he had looked at him alittle more closely, he thought: "That will do," and lifted him down tothe floor, and opened the chest.  Mercy!  What a quantity of gold wasthere!  He could buy with it the whole town, and the sugar sucking pigsof the cake woman, and all the tin soldiers, whips, and rocking-horsesin the whole world.  Yes, that was a quantity of money!  Now theSoldier threw away all the silver coin with which he had filled hispockets and his knapsack, and took gold instead; yes, all his pockets,his knapsack, his boots, and his cap were filled, so that he couldscarcely walk.  Now indeed he had plenty of money.  He put the dog onthe chest shut the door, and then called up through the tree: "Now pullme up, you old Witch!""Have you the Tinder-box?" asked the Witch."Plague on it!" exclaimed the Soldier, "I had clean forgotten that."And he went and brought it.The Witch drew him up, and he stood on the high road again, withpockets, boots, knapsack, and cap full of gold."What are you going to do with the Tinder-box?" asked the Soldier."That's nothing to you," retorted the Witch.  "You've had your money;just give me the Tinder-box.""Nonsense!" said the Soldier.  "Tell me directly what you're going todo with it or I'll draw my sword and cut off your head.""No!" cried the Witch.So the Soldier cut off her head.  There she lay!  But he tied up allhis money in her apron, took it on his back like a bundle, put theTinder-box in his pocket, and went straight off toward the town.That was a splendid town!  And he put up at the very best inn, andasked for the finest rooms, and ordered his favorite dishes, for now hewas rich, as he had so much money.  The servant who had to clean hisboots certainly thought them a remarkably old pair for such a richgentleman; but he had not bought any new ones yet.  The next day heprocured proper boots and handsome clothes.  Now our Soldier had becomea fine gentleman; and the people told him of all the splendid thingswhich were in their city, and about the King, and what a prettyPrincess the King's daughter was."Where can one get to see her?" asked the Soldier."She is not to be seen at all," said they all together; "she lives in agreat copper castle, with a great many walls and towers round about it:no one but the King may go in and out there, for it has been prophesiedthat she shall marry a common soldier, and the King can't bear that.""I should like to see her," thought the Soldier; but he could not getleave to do so.  Now he lived merrily, went to the theater, drove inthe King's garden, and gave much money to the poor; and this was verykind of him, for he knew from old times how hard it is when one has nota shilling.Now he was rich, had new clothes, and gained many friends, who all saidhe was a rare one, a true cavalier; and that pleased the Soldier well.But as he spent money every day and never carried any, he had at lastonly two shillings left; and he was obliged to turn out of the finerooms in which he had dwelt, and had to live in a little garret underthe roof, and clean his boots for himself, and mend them with adarning-needle.  None of his friends came to see him, for there weretoo many stairs to climb.It was quite dark one evening, and he could not even buy himself acandle, when it occurred to him that there was a candle end in theTinder-box which he had taken out of the hollow tree into which theWitch had helped him.  He brought out the Tinder-box and the candleend; but as soon as he struck fire and the sparks rose up from theflint, the door flew open, and the dog who had eyes as big as a coupleof teacups, and whom he had seen in the tree, stood before him, andsaid:"What are my lord's commands?""What is this?" said the Soldier.  "That's a famous Tinder-box, if Ican get everything with it that I want!  Bring me some money," said heto the dog; and whisk!  the dog was gone, and whisk!  he was backagain, with a great bag full of shillings in his mouth.Now the Soldier knew what a capital Tinder-box this was.  If he struckit once, the dog came who sat upon the chest of copper money; if hestruck it twice, the dog came who had the silver; and if he struck itthree times, then appeared the dog who had the gold.  Now the Soldiermoved back into the fine rooms, and appeared again in handsome clothes;and all his friends knew him again, and cared very much for him indeed.Once he thought to himself: "It is a very strange thing that one cannotget to see the Princess.  They all say she is very beautiful; but whatis the use of that, if she has always to sit in the great copper castlewith the many towers?  Can I not get to see her at all?  Where is myTinder-box?" And so he struck a light, and whisk!  came the dog witheyes as big as teacups."It is midnight, certainly," said the Soldier, "but I should very muchlike to see the Princess, only for one little moment."And the dog was outside the door directly, and, before the Soldierthought it, came back with the Princess.  She sat upon the dogs backand slept; and everyone could see she was a real Princess, for she wasso lovely.  The Soldier could not refrain from kissing her, for he wasa thorough soldier.  Then the dog ran back again with the Princess.But when morning came, and the King and Queen were drinking tea, thePrincess said she had had a strange dream the night before about a dogand a soldier-that she had ridden upon the dog, and the soldier hadkissed her."That would be a fine history!" said the Queen.So one of the old court ladies had to watch the next night by thePrincess's bed, to see if this was really a dream, or what it might be.The Soldier had a great longing to see the lovely Princess again; sothe dog came in the night, took her away, and ran as fast as he could.But the old lady put on water boots, and ran just as fast after him.When she saw that they both entered a great house, she thought: "Now Iknow where it is; and with a bit of chalk she drew a great cross on thedoor.  Then she went home and lay down, and the dog came up with thePrincess; but when he saw that there was a cross drawn on the doorwhere the Soldier lived, he took a piece of chalk too, and drew crosseson all the doors in the town.  And that was cleverly done, for now thelady could not find the right door, because all the doors had crossesupon them.In the morning early came the King and Queen, the old court lady andall the officers, to see where it was the Princess had been.  "Here itis!" said the King, when he saw the first door with a cross upon it."No, my dear husband, it is there!" said the Queen, who descriedanother door which also showed a cross.  "But there is one, and thereis one!" said all, for wherever they looked there were crosses on thedoors.  So they saw that it would avail them nothing if they searchedon.But the Queen was an exceedingly clever woman, who could do more thanride in a coach.  She took her great gold scissors, cut a piece of silkinto pieces, and made a neat little bag; this bag she filled with finewheat flour, and tied it on the Princess's back, and when that wasdone, she cut a little hole in the bag, so that the flour would bescattered along all the way which the Princess should take.In the night the dog came again, took the Princess on his back, and ranwith her to the Soldier, who loved her very much, and would gladly havebeen a prince, so that he might have her for his wife.  The dog did notnotice at all how the flour ran out in a stream from the castle to thewindows of the Soldier's house, where he ran up the wall with thePrincess.  In the morning the King and Queen saw well enough wheretheir daughter had been, and they took the Soldier and put him inprison.There he sat.  Oh, but it was dark and disagreeable there!  And theysaid to him: "To-morrow you shall be hanged."  That was not amusing tohear, and he had left his Tinder-box at the inn.  In the morning hecould see, through the iron grating of the little window, how thepeople were hurrying out of the town to see him hanged.  He heard thedrums beat and saw the soldiers marching.  All the people were runningout, and among them was the shoemaker's boy with leather apron andslippers, and he galloped so fast that one of his slippers flew off,and came right against the wall where the Soldier sat looking throughthe iron grating."Halloo, you shoemaker's boy!  you needn't be in such a hurry," criedthe Soldier to him: "it will not begin till I come.  But if you willrun to where I lived and bring me my Tinder-box, you shall have fourshillings: but you must put your best leg foremost."The shoemaker's boy wanted to get the four shillings, so he went andbrought the Tinder-box, and-well, we shall hear now what happened.Outside the town a great gallows had been built, and round it stood thesoldiers and many hundred thousand people.  The King and Queen sat on asplendid throne, opposite to the judges and the whole council.  Thesoldiers already stood upon the ladder; but as they were about to putthe rope round his neck, he said that before a poor criminal sufferedhis punishment an innocent request was always granted to him.  Hewanted very much to smoke a pipe of tobacco, and it would be the lastpipe he should smoke in the world.  The King would not say "No" tothis; so the Soldier took his Tinder-box and struck fire.  One-two-three! - and there suddenly stood all the dogs-the one with eyes as bigas teacups, the one with eyes as large as mill wheels, and the onewhose eyes were as big as round towers."Help me now, so that I may not be hanged," said the Soldier.And the dogs fell upon the judges and all the council, seized one bythe leg and another by the nose, and tossed them many feet into theair, so that they fell down and were all broken to pieces."I won't!" cried the King; but the biggest dog took him and the Queen,and threw them after the others.  Then the soldiers were afraid, andthe people cried: "Little Soldier, you shall be our king, and marry thebeautiful Princess."So they put the Soldier into the King's coach, and all the three dogsdarted on in front and cried "Hurrah!" and the boys whistled throughtheir fingers, and the soldiers presented arms.  The Princess came outof the copper castle, and became Queen, and she liked that well enough.The wedding lasted a week, and the three dogs sat at the table too, andopened their eyes wider than ever at all they saw.THE CONSTANT TIN SOLDIERBy Hans Christian AndersenTHERE were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers; they were all brothers,for they had all been born of one old tin spoon.  They shouldered theirmuskets, and looked straight before them; their uniform was red andblue, and very splendid.  The first thing they had heard in the world,when the lid was taken off the box, had been the words "Tin soldiers!"These words were tittered by a little boy, clapping his hands; thesoldiers had been given to him, for it was his birthday; and now he putthem upon the table.  Each soldier was exactly like the rest; but oneof them had been cast last of all, and there had not been enough tin tofinish him; but he stood as firmly upon his one leg as the others ontheir two; and it was just this soldier who became remarkable.On the table on which they had been placed stood many other playthings,but the toy that attracted most attention was a neat castle ofcardboard.  Through the little windows one could see straight into thehall.  Before the castle some little trees were placed round a littlelooking-glass, which was to represent a clear lake.  Waxen swans swamon this lake, and were mirrored in it.  This was all very pretty; butthe prettiest of all was a little Lady, who stood at the open door ofthe castle; she was also cut out in paper, but she had a dress of theclearest gauze, and a little narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders thatlooked like a scarf; and in the middle of this ribbon was a shiningtinsel rose, as big as her whole face.  The little Lady stretched outboth her arms, for she was a dancer, and then she lifted one leg sohigh that the Tin Soldier could not see it at all, and thought that,like himself, she had but one leg."That would be the wife for me," thought he; "but she is very grand.She lives in a castle, and I have only a box, and there are five-and-twenty of us in that.  It is no place for her.  But I must try to makeacquaintance with her."And then he lay down at full length behind a snuffbox which was on thetable; there he could easily watch the little dainty lady, whocontinued to stand on one leg without losing her balance.When the evening came, all the other tin soldiers were put into theirbox, and the people in the house went to bed.  Now the toys began toplay at "visiting," and at "war," and "giving balls."  The tin soldiersrattled in their box, for they wanted to join, but could not lift thelid.  The Nutcracker threw somersaults, and the Pencil amused itself onthe table; there was so much noise that the Canary woke up, and beganto speak too, and even in verse.  The only two who did not stir fromtheir places were the Tin Soldier and the Dancing Lady; she stoodstraight up on the point of one of her toes, and stretched out both herarms: and he was just as enduring on his one leg; and he never turnedhis eyes away from her.Now the clock struck twelve-and, bounce! -the lid flew off thesnuffbox; but there was not snuff in it, but a little black goblin; yousee, it was a trick."Tin Soldier," said the Goblin, "don't stare at things that don'tconcern you."But the Tin Soldier pretended not to hear him.  "Just you wait till to-morrow!" said the Goblin.  But when the morning came, and the childrengot up, the Tin Soldier was placed in the window; and whether it wasthe Goblin or the draft that did it, all at once the window flew open,and the Soldier fell, head over heels, out of the third story.  Thatwas a terrible passage!  He put his leg straight up, and struck withhis helmet downward, and his bayonet between the paving stones.The servant maid and the little boy came down directly to look for him,but though they almost trod upon him they could not see him.  If theSoldier had cried out, "Here I am!" they would have found him; but hedid not think it fitting to call out loudly, because he was in uniform.Now it began to rain; the drops soon fell thicker, and at last it camedown in a complete stream.  When the rain was past, two street boyscame by."Just look!" said one of them, "there lies a tin soldier.  He must comeout and ride in the boat."And they made a boat out of a newspaper, and put the Tin Soldier in themiddle of it; and so he sailed down the gutter, and the two boys ranbeside him and clapped their hands.  Goodness preserve us!  how thewaves rose in that gutter, and how fast the stream ran!  But then ithad been a heavy rain.  The paper boat rocked up and down, andsometimes turned round so rapidly that the Tin Soldier trembled; but heremained firm and never changed countenance, and looked straight beforehim, and shouldered his musket.All at once the boat went into a long drain, and it became as dark asif he had been in his box."Where am I going now?" he thought.  "Yes, yes, that's the Goblin'sfault.  Ah! if the little Lady only sat here with me in the boat, itmight be twice as dark for what I should care."Suddenly there came a great water rat, which lived under the drain."Have you a passport?" said the Rat.  "Give me your passport."But the Tin Soldier kept silence, and only held his musket tighter thanever.The boat went on, but the Rat came after it.  Hu! how he gnashed histeeth, and called out to the bits of straw and wood:"Hold him! hold him! he hasn't paid toll-he hasn't showed hispassport!"But the stream became stronger and stronger.  The Tin Soldier could seethe bright daylight where the arch ended; but he heard a roaring noise,which might well frighten a bolder man.  Only think-just where thetunnel ended the drain ran into a great canal; and for him that wouldhave been as dangerous as for us to be carried down a great waterfall.Now he was already so near it that he could not stop.  The boat wascarried out, the poor Tin Soldier stiffening himself as much as hecould, and no one could say that he moved an eyelid.  The boat whirledround three or four times, and was full of water to the very edge- itmust sink.  The Tin Soldier stood up to his neck in water, and the boatsank deeper and deeper, and the paper was loosened more and more, andnow the water closed over the Soldier's head.  Then he thought of thepretty little dancer, and how he should never see her again; and itsounded in the Soldier's ears:'Farewell, farewell, thou warrior brave,Die shalt thou this day."And now the paper parted, and the Tin Soldier fell out; but at thatmoment he was snapped up by a great fish.Oh, how dark it was in that fish's body!  It was darker yet than in thedrain tunnel; and then it was very narrow, too.  But the Tin Soldierremained unmoved, and lay at full length, shouldering his musket.The fish swam to and fro; he made the most wonderful movements, andthen became quite still.  At last something flashed through him likelightning.  The daylight shone quite clear, and a voice said aloud,"The Tin Soldier!" The fish had been caught, carried to market, bought,and taken into the kitchen, where the cook cut him open with a largeknife.  She seized the Soldier round the body with both her hands, andcarried him into the room, where all were anxious to see the remarkableman who had traveled about in the inside of a fish; but the Tin Soldierwas not at all proud.  They placed him on the table, and there-no!What curious things may happen in the world!  The Tin Soldier was inthe very room in which he had been before!  he saw the same children,and the same toys stood upon the table; and there was the pretty castlewith the graceful little Dancer.  She was still balancing herself onone leg and held the other extended in the air.  She was faithful, too.That moved the Tin Soldier: he was very near weeping tin tears, butthat would not have been proper.  He looked at her, but they saidnothing to each other.Then one of the little boys took the Tin Soldier and flung him into thestove.  He gave no reason for doing this.  It must have been the faultof the Goblin in the snuffbox.The Tin Soldier stood there quite illuminated, and felt a heat that wasterrible; but whether this heat proceeded from the real fire or fromlove he did not know.  The colors had quite gone off from him; butwhether that had happened on the journey, or had been caused by grief,no one could say.  He looked at the little Lady, she looked at him, andhe felt that he was melting; but he stood firm, shouldering his musket.Then suddenly the door flew open, and the draft of air caught theDancer, and she flew like a sylph just into the stove to the TinSoldier, and flashed up in a flame, and then was gone!  Then the TinSoldier melted down into a lump, and when the servant maid took theashes out next day, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart.But of the Dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose, and that wasburned as black as coal.THE FIR TREEBy Hans Christian AndersenOUT in the woods stood a nice little Fir tree.  The place he had was avery good one; the sun shone on him; as to fresh air, there was enoughof that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well asfirs.  But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not carefor the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when theywere in the wood looking for wild strawberries.  The children oftencame with a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of themthreaded on a straw, and sat down near the young Tree and said, "Oh,how pretty he is!  what a nice little fir!" But this was what the Treecould not bear to hear.At the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another yearhe was another long bit taller; for with fir trees one can always tellby the shoots how many years old they are."Oh, were I but such a high tree as the others are," sighed he.  "ThenI should be able to spread out my branches, and with the tops to lookinto the wide world!  Then would the birds build nests among mybranches; and when there was a breeze, I could bend with as muchstateliness as the others!"Neither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the red clouds which morningand evening sailed above him, gave the little Tree any pleasure.In winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare wouldoften come leaping along, and jump right over the little Tree.  Oh,that made him so angry!  But two winters were past, and in the thirdthe Tree was so large that the hare was obliged to go round it.  "Togrow and grow, to get older and be tall," thought the Tree-"that, afterall, is the most delightful thing in the world!"In autumn the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largesttrees.  This happened every year; and the young Fir tree, that had nowgrown to a very comely size, trembled at the sight; for the magnificentgreat trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the brancheswere lopped off, and the trees looked long and bare: they were hardlyto be recognized; and then they were laid in carts, and the horsesdragged them out of the wood.Where did they go to?  What became of them?  In spring, when theSwallows and the Storks came, the Tree asked them: "Don't you knowwhere they have been taken?  Have you not met them anywhere?"The Swallows did not know anything about it; but the Stork lookedmusing, nodded his head, and said: "Yes; I think I know; I met manyships as I was flying hither from Egypt; on the ships were magnificentmasts, and I venture to assert that it was they that smelled so of fir.I may congratulate you, for they lifted themselves on high mostmajestically!""Oh, were I but old enough to fly across the sea!  But how does the sealook in reality?  What is it like?""That would take a long time to explain," said the Stork, and withthese words off he went."Rejoice in thy growth!" said the Sunbeams, "rejoice in thy vigorousgrowth, and in the fresh life that groweth within thee!"And the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears over him; but theFir understood it not.When Christmas came, quite young trees were cut down; trees which oftenwere not even as large or of the same age as this Fir tree, who couldnever rest, but always wanted to be off.  These young trees, and theywere always the finest looking, retained their branches; they were laidon carts, and the horses drew them out of the wood."Where are they going to?" asked the Fir."They are not taller than I; there was one indeed that was considerablyshorter; -and why do they retain all their branches?  Whither are theytaken?""We know!  we know!" chirped the Sparrows.  "'We have peeped in at thewindows in the town below!  We know whither they are taken!  Thegreatest splendor and the greatest magnificence one can imagine awaitthem.  We peeped through the windows, and saw them planted in themiddle of the warm room, and ornamented with the most splendid things-with gilded apples, with gingerbread, with toys, and many hundredlights!""And then?" asked the Fir tree, trembling in every bough.  "And then?What happens then?""We did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful.""I would fain know if I am destined for so glorious a career," criedthe Tree, rejoicing.  "That is still better than to cross the sea!What a longing do I suffer!  Were Christmas but come!  I am now tall,and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year!Oh, were I but already on the cart!  Were I in the warm room with allthe splendor and magnificence!  Yes; then something better, somethingstill grander, will surely follow, or wherefore should they thusornament me?  Something better, something still grander, must follow-but what?  Oh, how I long, how I suffer!  I do not know myself what isthe matter with me!""Rejoice in our presence!" said the Air and the Sunlight; "rejoice inthy own fresh youth!"But the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was greenboth winter and summer.  People that saw him said, "What a fine tree!"and toward Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down.  The axstruck deep into the very pith; the tree fell to the earth with a sigh:he felt a pang -it was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness,for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the placewhere he had sprung up.  He well knew that he should never see his dearold comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, any more;perhaps not even the birds!  The departure was not at all agreeable.The Tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard withthe other trees, and heard a man say, "That one is splendid!  we don'twant the others."  Then two servants came in rich livery and carriedthe Fir tree into a large and splendid drawing-room.  Portraits werehanging on the walls, and near the white porcelain stove stood twolarge Chinese vases with lions on the covers.  There, too, were largeeasy-chairs, silken sofas, large tables full of picture books, and fullof toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns-at least the childrensaid so.  And the Fir tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filledwith sand: but no one could see that it was a cask, for green cloth washung all round it, and it stood on a large gayly colored carpet.  Oh,how the Tree quivered!  What was to happen?  The servants, as well asthe young ladies, decorated it.  On one branch there hung little netscut out of colored paper, and each net was filled with sugarplums; andamong the other boughs gilded apples and walnuts were suspended,looking as though they had grown there, and little blue and whitetapers were placed among the leaves.  Dolls that looked for all theworld like men -the Tree had never beheld such before-were seen amongthe foliage, and at the very top a large star of gold tinsel was fixed.It was really splendid -beyond description splendid."This evening!" said they all; "how it will shine this evening!""Oh," thought the Tree, "if the evening were but come!  If the taperswere but lighted!  And then I wonder what will happen!  Perhaps theother trees from the forest will come to look at me!  Perhaps thesparrows will beat against the windowpanes!  I wonder if I shall takeroot here, and winter and summer stand covered with ornaments!"He knew very much about the matter!  but he was so impatient that forsheer longing he got a pain in his back, and this with trees is thesame thing as a headache with us.The candles were now lighted.  What brightness!  What splendor!  TheTree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to thefoliage.  It blazed up splendidly."Help!  help!" cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out thefire.Now the Tree did not even dare tremble.  What a state he was in!  Hewas so uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendor, that hewas quite bewildered amid the glare and brightness; when suddenly bothfolding doors opened, and a troop of children rushed in as if theywould upset the Tree.  The older persons followed quietly; the littleones stood quite still.  But it was only for a moment; then theyshouted so that the whole place reechoed with their rejoicing; theydanced round the Tree, and one present after the other was pulled off."What are they about?" thought the Tree.  "What is to happen now!" Andthe lights burned down to the very branches, and as they burned downthey were put out one after the other, and then the children hadpermission to plunder the Tree.  So they fell upon it with suchviolence that all its branches cracked; if it had not been fixed firmlyin the cask, it would certainly have tumbled down.The children danced about with their beautiful playthings; no onelooked at the Tree except the old nurse, who peeped between thebranches; but it was only to see if there was a fig or an apple leftthat had been forgotten."A story!  a story!" cried the children, drawing a little fat mantoward the Tree.  He seated himself under it, and said: "Now we are inthe shade, and the Tree can listen too.  But I shall tell only onestory.  Now which will you have; that about IvedyAvedy, or aboutKlumpy-Dumpy who tumbled downstairs, and yet after all came to thethrone and married the princess?""Ivedy-Avedy," cried some; "Klumpy-Dumpy," cried the others.  There wassuch a bawling and screaming!  -the Fir tree alone was silent, and hethought to himself, "Am I not to bawl with the rest?-am I to do nothingwhatever?" for he was one of the company, and had done what he had todo.And the man told about Klumpy-Dumpy that tumbled down, whonotwithstanding came to the throne, and at last married the princess.And the children clapped their hands, arid cried out, "Oh, go on!  Dogo on!" they waited to hear about Ivedy-Avedy too, but the little manonly told them about Klumpy-Dumpy.  The Fir tree stood quite still andabsorbed in thought: the birds in the wood had never related the likeof this.  "Klumpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married theprincess!  Yes, yes!  that's the way of the world!" thought the Firtree, and believed it all, because the man who told the story was sogood-looking.  "Well, well!  who knows, perhaps I may fall downstairstoo, and get a princess as wife!"  And he looked forward with joy tothe morrow, when he hoped to be decked out again with lights, play-things, fruits, and tinsel."I won't tremble to-morrow!" thought the Fir tree.  "I will enjoy tothe full all my splendor!  To-morrow I shall hear again the story ofKlumpy-Dumpy, and perhaps that of Ivedy-Avedy too." And the whole nightthe Tree stood still and in deep thought.In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in."Now then the splendor will begin again," thought the Fir.  But theydragged him out of the room, and up the stairs into the loft; and here,in a dark corner, where no daylight could enter, they left him."What's the meaning of this?" thought the Tree.  "What am I to do here?What shall I hear now, I wonder?"  And he leaned against the wall lostin reverie.  Time enough had he too for his reflections; for days andnights passed on, and nobody came up; and when at last somebody didcome, it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way.There stood the Tree quite hidden; it seemed as if he had been entirelyforgotten."'Tis now winter out-of-doors!" thought the Tree.  "The earth is hardand covered with snow; men cannot plant me now, and therefore I havebeen put up here under shelter till the springtime comes!  Howthoughtful that is!  How kind man is, after all!  If it only were notso dark here, and so terribly lonely!  Not even a hare.  And out in thewoods it was so pleasant, when the snow was on the ground, and the hareleaped by; yes-even when he jumped over me; but I did not like it then.It is really terribly lonely here!""Squeak!  squeak!" said a little Mouse at the same moment, peeping outof his hole.  And then another little one came.  They snuffed about theFir tree, and rustled among the branches."It is dreadfully cold," said the Mouse.  "But for that, it would bedelightful here, old Fir, wouldn't it?""I am by no means old," said the Fir tree.  "There's many a oneconsiderably older than I am.""Where do you come from," asked the Mice; "and what can you do?"  Theywere so extremely curious.  "Tell us about the most beautiful spot onthe earth.  Have you never been there?  Were you never in the larder,where cheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from above; where onedances about on tallow candles; that place where one enters lean, andcomes out again fat and portly?""I know no such place," said the Tree.  "But I know the wood, where thesun shines, and where the little birds sing."  And then he told allabout his youth; and the little Mice had never heard the like before;and they listened and said:"Well, to be sure!  How much you have seen!  How happy you must havebeen!""I!" said the Fir tree, thinking over what he had himself related."Yes, in reality those were happy times."  And then he told aboutChristmas Eve, when he was decked out with cakes and candles."Oh," said the little Mice, "how fortunate you have been, old Firtree!""I am by no means old," said he.  "I came from the wood this winter; Iam in my prime, and am only rather short for my age.""What delightful stories you know!" said the Mice; and the next nightthey came with four other little Mice, who were to hear what the Treerecounted; and the more he related, the more plainly he remembered allhimself; and it appeared as if those times had really been happy times."But they may still come-they may still come.  Humpy-Dumpy felldownstairs, and yet he got a princess!" and he thought at the moment ofa nice little Birch tree growing out in the woods; to the Fir, thatwould be a real charming princess."Who is Klumpy-Dumpy?" asked the Mice.  So then the Fir tree told thewhole fairy tale, for he could remember every single word of it; andthe little Mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the Tree.  Nextnight two more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats, even; but they saidthe stories were not interesting, which vexed the little Mice; andthey, too, now began to think them not so very amusing either."Do you know only one story?" asked the Rats."Only that one," answered the Tree.  "I heard it on my happiestevening; but I did not then know how happy I was.""It is a very stupid story!  Don't you know one about bacon and tallowcandles?  Can't you tell any larder stories?""No," said the Tree."Then good-by," said the Rats and they went home.At last the little Mice stayed away also; and the Tree sighed: "Afterall, it was very pleasant when the sleek little Mice sat round me andlistened to what I told them.  Now that too is over.  But I will takegood care to enjoy myself when I am brought out again."But when was that to be?  Why, one morning there came a quantity ofpeople and set to work in the loft.  The trunks were moved, the treewas pulled out and thrown-rather hard, it is true- down on the floor,but a man drew him toward the stairs, where the daylight shone."Now a merry life will begin again," thought the Tree.  He felt thefresh air, the first sunbeam- and now he was out in the courtyard.  Allpassed so quickly, there was so much going on around him, that the Treequite forgot to look to himself.  The court adjoined a garden, and allwas in flower; the roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade,the lindens were in blossom, the Swallows flew by, and said "Quirre-vit!  my husband is come!" but it was not the Fir tree that they meant."Now, then, I shall really enjoy life," said he, exultingly, and spreadout his branches; but, alas!  they were all withered and yellow.  Itwas in a corner that he lay, among weeds and nettles.  The golden starof tinsel was still on the top of the Tree, and glittered in thesunshine.In the courtyard some of the merry children were playing who had dancedat Christmas round the Fir tree, and were so glad at the sight of him.One of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star."Only look what is still on the ugly old Christmas tree!" said he,trampling on the branches, so that they all cracked beneath his feet.And the Tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers, and the freshness inthe garden; he beheld himself, and wished he had remained in his darkcorner in the loft: he thought of his first youth in the wood, of theMerry Christmas Eve, and of the little Mice who had listened with somuch pleasure to the story of Humpy-Dumpy."'Tis over-'tis past!" said the poor Tree.  "Had I but rejoiced when Ihad reason to do so!  But now 'tis past, 'tis past!"And the gardener's boy chopped the Tree into small pieces; there was awhole heap lying there.  The wood flamed up splendidly under the largebrewing copper, and it sighed so deeply!  Each sigh was like a shot.The boys played about in the court, and the youngest wore the gold staron his breast which the Tree had had on the happiest evening of hislife.  However, that was over now-the Tree gone, the story at an end.All, all was over; every tale must end at last.THE FLYING TRUNKBy Hans Christian AndersenTHERE was once a merchant, who was so rich that he could pave the wholestreet with gold, and almost have enough left for a little lane.  Buthe did not do that; he knew how to employ his money differently.  Whenhe spent a shilling he got back a crown, such a clever merchant was he;and this continued till he died.His son now got all this money; and he lived merrily, going to themasquerade every evening, making kites out of dollar notes, and playingat ducks and drakes on the seacoast with gold pieces instead ofpebbles.  In this way the money might soon be spent, and indeed it wasso.  At last he had no more than four shillings left, and no clothes towear but a pair of slippers and an old dressing gown.Now his friends did not trouble themselves any more about him as theycould not walk with him in the street, but one of them, who was good-natured, sent him an old trunk, with the remark:  "Pack up!"  Yes, thatwas all very well, but he had nothing to pack, therefore he seatedhimself in the trunk.That was a wonderful trunk.  So soon as any one pressed the lock thetrunk could fly.  He pressed it, and whirr!  away flew the trunk withhim through the chimney and over the clouds farther and farther away.But as often as the bottom of the trunk cracked a little he was ingreat fear lest it might go to pieces, and then he would have flung afine somersault!  In that way he came to the land of the Turks.  He hidthe trunk in a wood under some dry leaves, and then went into the town.He could do that very well, for among the Turks all the people wentabout dressed like himself in dressing gown and slippers.  Then he meta nurse with a little child."Here, you Turkish nurse," he began, "what kind of a great castle isthat close by the town, in which the windows are so high up?""There dwells the Sultan's daughter," replied she.  "It is prophesiedthat she will be very unhappy respecting a lover; and therefore nobodymay go near her, unless the Sultan and Sultana are there too.""Thank you!" said the Merchant's Son; and he went out into the forest,seated himself in his trunk, flew on the roof, and crept through thewindow into the Princess's room.She was lying asleep on the sofa, and she was so beautiful that theMerchant's Son was compelled to kiss her.  Then she awoke, and wasstartled very much; but he said he was a Turkish angel who had comedown to her through the air, and that pleased her.They sat down side by side, and he told her stories about her eyes; andhe told her they were the most glorious dark lakes, and that thoughtswere swimming about in them like mermaids.  And he told her about herforehead; that it was a snowy mountain with the most splendid halls andpictures.  And he told her about the stork who brings the lovely littlechildren.Yes, those were fine histories!  Then he asked the Princess if shewould marry him, and she said, "Yes," directly."But you must come here on Saturday," said she.  "Then the Sultan andSultana will be here to tea.  They will be very proud that I am tomarry a Turkish angel.  But take care that you know a very prettystory, for both my parents are very fond indeed of stories.  My motherlikes them high-flown and moral, but my father likes them merry, sothat one can laugh.""Yes, I shall bring no marriage gift but a story," said he; and so theyparted.  But the Princess gave him a saber, the sheath embroidered withgold pieces and that was very useful to him.Now he flew away, bought a new dressing gown, and sat in the forest andmade up a story; it was to be ready by Saturday, and that was not aneasy thing.By the time he had finished it Saturday had come.  The Sultan and hiswife and all the court were at the 'Princess's to tea.  He was receivedvery graciously."Will you relate us a story?" said the Sultana; "one that is deep andedifying.""Yes, but one that we can laugh at," said the Sultan."Certainly," he replied; and so began.  And now listen well."There was once a bundle of Matches, and these Matches wereparticularly proud of their high descent.  Their genealogical tree,that is to say, the great fir tree of which each of them was a littlesplinter, had been a great old tree out in the forest.  The Matches nowlay between a Tinder-box and an old Iron Pot; and they were tellingabout the days of their youth.  'Yes, when we were upon the greenboughs,' they said, 'then we really were upon the green boughs!  Everymorning and evening there was diamond tea for us-I mean dew; we hadsunshine all day long whenever the sun shone, and all the little birdshad to tell stories.  We could see very well that we were rich, for theother trees were only dressed out in summer, while our family had themeans to wear green dresses in the winter as well.  But then thewoodcutter came, like a great revolution, and our family was broken up.The head of the family got an appointment as mainmast in a first-rateship, which could sail round the world if necessary; the other brancheswent to other places, and now we have the office of kindling a lightfor the vulgar herd.  That's how we grand people came to be in thekitchen.'"'My fate was of different kind,' said the Iron Pot, which stood nextto the Matches.  'From the beginning, ever since I came into the world,there has been a great deal of scouring and cooking done in me.  I lookafter the practical part, and am the first here in the house.  My onlypleasure is to sit in my place after dinner, very clean and neat, andto carry on a sensible conversation with my comrades.  But except theWaterpot, which is sometimes taken down into the courtyard, we alwayslive within our four walls.  Our only newsmonger is the Market Basket;but he speaks very uneasily about the government and the people.  Yes,the other day there was an old pot that fell down, from fright, andburst.  He's liberal, I can tell you!'- 'Now you're talking too much,'the Tinder-box interrupted, and the steel struck against the flint, sothat sparks flew out.  'Shall we not have a merry evening?'"'Yes, let us talk about who is the grandest,' said the Matches."'No, I don't like to talk about myself,' retorted the Pot. 'Let us getup an evening entertainment.  I will begin.  I will tell a story fromreal life, something that everyone has experienced, so that we caneasily imagine the situation, and take pleasure in it.   On the Baltic,by the Danish shore-'"'That's a pretty beginning!' cried all the Plates.  'That will be astory we shall like.'"'Yes, it happened to me in my youth, when I lived in a family wherethe furniture was polished, the floors scoured, and new curtains wereput up every fortnight.'"'What an interesting way you have of telling a story!' said the CarpetBroom.  'One can tell directly that a man is speaking who has been inwoman's society.  There's something pure runs through it.'"And the Pot went on telling the story, and the end was as good as thebeginning."All the Plates rattled with joy, and the Carpet Broom brought somegreen parsley out of the dust hole, and put it like a wreath on thePot, for he knew that it would vex the others.  'If I crown him to-day,' it thought, 'he will crown me tomorrow.'"'Now I'll dance,' said the Fire Tongs; and they danced.  Preserve us!how that implement could lift up one leg!  The old chair-cushion burstto see it.  'Shall I be crowned too?' thought the Tongs; and indeed awreath was awarded."'They're only common people, after all!' thought the Matches."Now the Tea Urn was to sing; but she said she had taken cold and couldnot sing unless she felt boiling within.  But that was onlyaffectation: she did not want to sing, except when she was in theparlor with the grand people."In the window sat an old Quill Pen, with which the maid generallywrote: there was nothing remarkable about this pen, except that it hadbeen dipped too deep into the ink, but she was proud of that.  'If theTea Urn won't sing,' she said, 'she may leave it alone.  Outside hangsa nightingale in a cage, and he can sing.  He hasn't had any education,but this evening we'll say nothing about that.'"'I think it very wrong,' said the Teakettle- he was the kitchensinger, and half brother to the Tea Urn-'that that rich and foreignbird should be listened to.  Is that patriotic?  Let the Market Basketdecide.'"'I am vexed,' said the Market Basket.  'No one can imagine how much Iam secretly vexed.  Is that a proper way of spending the evening?Would it not be more sensible to put the house in order?  Let each onego to his own place, and I will arrange the whole game.  That would bequite another thing.''Yes, let us make a disturbance, cried they all.  Then the door opened,and the maid came in, and they all stood still; not one stirred.  Butthere was not one pot among them who did not know what he could do andhow grand he was.  'Yes, if I had liked,' each one thought, 'it mighthave been a very merry evening.'"The servant girl took the Matches and lighted the fire with them.mercy!  how they sputtered and burst out into flame! 'Now everyone cansee,' thought they, 'that we are the first.  How we shine!  what alight!'-and they burned out.""That was a capital story," said the Sultana.  "I feel myself quitecarried away to the kitchen, to the Matches.  Yes, now thou shalt marryour daughter.""Yes, certainly," said the Sultan, "thou shalt marry our daughter onMonday."And they called him thou, because he was to belong to the family.The wedding was decided on, and on the evening before it the whole citywas illuminated.  Biscuits and cakes were thrown among the people, thestreet boys stood on their toes, called out "Hurrah!" and whistled ontheir fingers.  It was uncommonly splendid."Yes, I shall have to give something as a treat," thought theMerchant's Son.  So he bought rockets and crackers, and everyimaginable sort of fire-work, put them all into his trunk, and flew upinto the air."Crack!" how they went, and how they went off!  All the Turks hopped upwith such a start that their slippers flew about their ears; such ameteor they had never yet seen.  Now they could understand that it mustbe a Turkish angel who was going to marry the Princess.What stories people tell!  Everyone whom he asked about it had seen itin a separate way; but one and all thought it fine."I saw the Turkish angel himself," said one.  "He had eyes like glowingstars, and a beard like foaming water.""He flew up in a fiery mantle," said another; "the most lovely littlecherub peeped forth from among the folds."Yes, they were wonderful things that he heard; and on the following dayhe was to be married.Now he went back to the forest to rest himself in his trunk.  But whathad become of that?  A spark from the fireworks had set fire to it, andthe trunk was burned to ashes.  He could not fly any more, and couldnot get to his bride.She stood all day on the roof waiting; and most likely she is waitingstill.  But he wanders through the world, telling fairy tales; but theyare not so merry as that one he told about the Matches.THE DARNING NEEDLEBy Hans Christian AndersenTHERE was once a darning needle, who thought herself so fine, sheimagined she was an embroidery needle."Take care, and mind you hold me tight!" she said to the Fingers thattook her out.  "Don't let me fall!  If I fall on the ground I shallcertainly never be found again, for I am so fine!""That's as it may be," said the Fingers; and they grasped her round thebody."See, I'm coming with a train!" said the Darning Needle, and she drew along thread after her, but there was no knot in the thread.The Fingers pointed the needle just at the cook's slipper, in which theupper leather had burst, and was to be sewn together."That's vulgar work," said the Darning Needle.  "I shall never getthrough.  I'm breaking!  I'm breaking!" And she really broke.  "Did Inot say so?" said the Darning Needle; "I'm too fine!""Now it's quite useless," said the Fingers; but they were obliged tohold her fast, all the same; for the cook dropped some sealing wax uponthe needle, and pinned her handkerchief together with it in front."So, now I'm a breastpin!" said the Darning Needle.  "I knew very wellthat I should come to honor: when one is something, one comes tosomething!"And she laughed quietly to herself-and one can never see when a darningneedle laughs.  There she sat, as proud as if she was in a state coach,and looked all about her."May I be permitted to ask if you are of gold?" she inquired of thepin, her neighbor.  "You have a very pretty appearance, and a peculiarhead, but it is only little.  You must take pains to grow, for it's noteveryone that has sealing wax dropped upon him."And the Darning Needle drew herself up so proudly that she fell out ofthe handkerchief right into the sink, which the cook was rinsing out."Now we're going on a journey," said the Darning Needle.  "If I onlydon't get lost!"But she really was lost."I'm too fine for this world," she observed, as she lay in the gutter."But I know who I am, and there's always something in that!"So the Darning Needle kept her proud behavior, and did not lose hergood humor.  And things of many kinds swam over her, chips and strawsand pieces of old newspapers."Only look how they sail!" said the Darning Needle.  "They don't knowwhat is under them!  I'm here, I remain firmly here.  See, there goes achip thinking of nothing in the world but of himself-of a chip!There's a straw going by now.  How he turns!  how he twirls about!Don't think only of yourself, you might easily run up against a stone.There swims a bit of newspaper.  What's written upon it has long beenforgotten, and yet it gives itself airs.  I sit quietly and patientlyhere.  I know who I am, and I shall remain what I am."One day something lay close beside her that glittered splendidly; thenthe Darning Needle believed that it was a diamond; but it was a bit ofbroken bottle; and because it shone, the Darning Needle spoke to it,introducing herself as a breastpin."I suppose you are a diamond?" she observed."Why, yes, something of that kind."And then each believed the other to be a very valuable thing; and theybegan speaking about the world, and how very conceited it was."I have been in a lady's box," said the Darning Needle, "and this ladywas a cook.  She had five fingers on each hand, and I never sawanything so conceited as those five fingers.  And yet they were onlythere that they might take me out of the box and put me back into it.""Were they of good birth?" asked the Bit of Bottle."No, indeed," cried the Darning Needle, "but very haughty.  There werefive brothers, all of the finger family.  They kept very proudlytogether, though they were of different lengths: the outermost, thethumbling, was short and fat; he walked out in front of the ranks, andonly had one joint in his back, and could only make a single bow; buthe said that if he were hacked off a man, that man was useless forservice in war.  Daintymouth, the second finger, thrust himself intosweet and sour, pointed to sun and moon, and gave the impression whenthey wrote.  Longrnan, the third, looked at all the others over hisshoulder.  Goldborder, the fourth, went about with a golden belt roundhis waist; and little Playman did nothing at all, and was proud of it.There was nothing but bragging among them, and therefore I went away.""And now we sit here and glitter!" said the Bit of Bottle.At that moment more water came into the gutter, so that it overflowed,and the Bit of Bottle was carried away."So he is disposed of," observed the Darning Needle.  "I remain here, Iam too fine.  But that's my pride, and my pride is honorable."  Andproudly she sat there, and had many great thoughts.  "I could almostbelieve I had been born of a sunbeam, I'm so fine!  It really appearsas if the sunbeams were always seeking for me under the water.  Ah!I'm so fine that my mother cannot find me.  If I had my old eye, whichbroke off, I think I should cry; but, no, I should not do that: it'snot genteel to cry."One day a couple of street boys lay grubbing in the gutter where theysometimes find old nails, farthings, and similar treasures.  It wasdirty work, but they took great delight in it."Oh!" cried one, who had pricked himself with the Darning Needle,there's a fellow for you!""I'm not a fellow; I'm a young lady!" said the Darning Needle.But nobody listened to her.  The sealing wax had come off, and she hadturned black; but black makes one look slender, and she thought herselffiner even than before."Here comes an eggshell sailing along!" said the boys; and they stuckthe Darning Needle fast in the eggshell."White walls, and black myself!  that looks well," remarked the DarningNeedle.  "Now one can see me.  I only hope I shall not be seasick!"But she was not seasick at all.  "It is good against seasickness, ifone has a steel stomach, and does not forget that one is a little morethan an ordinary person!  Now my seasickness is over.  The finer oneis, the more one can bear.""Crack!" went the eggshell, for a wagon went over her."Good heavens, how it crushes one!" said the Darning Needle.  "I'mgetting seasick now-I'm quite sick."But she was not really sick, though the wagon went over her; she laythere at full length, and there she may lie.PEN AND INKSTANDBy Hans Christian AndersenTHE following remark was made in a poet's room, as the speaker lookedat the inkstand that stood upon his table:"It is marvelous all that can come out of that ink-stand!  What will itproduce next?  Yes, it is marvelous!""So it is!" exclaimed the Inkstand.  "It is incomprehensible!  That iswhat I always say."  It was thus the Inkstand addressed itself to thePen, and to everything else that could hear it on the table.  "It isreally astonishing all that can come from me!  It is almost incredible!I positively do not know myself what the next thing may be, when aperson begins to dip into me.  One drop of me serves for half a side ofpaper; and what may not then appear upon it?  I am certainly somethingextraordinary.  From me proceed all the works of the poets.  Theseanimated beings, whom people think they recognize-these deep feelings,that gay humor, these charming descriptions of nature -I do notunderstand them myself, for I know nothing about nature; but still itis all in me.  From me have gone forth, and still go forth, thesewarrior hosts, these lovely maidens, these bold knights on snortingsteeds, those droll characters in humbler life.  The fact is, however,that I do not know anything about them myself.  I assure you they arenot my ideas.""You are right there," replied the Pen.  "You have few ideas, and donot trouble yourself much with thinking, if you did exert yourself tothink, you would perceive that you ought to give something that was notdry.  You supply me with the means of committing to paper what I havein me; I write with that.  It is the pen that writes.  Mankind do notdoubt that; and most men have about as much genius for poetry as an oldinkstand.""You have but little experience," said the ink-stand.  "You havescarcely been a week in use, and you are already half worn out.  Do youfancy that you are a poet?  You are only a servant: and I have had manyof your kind before you came- many of the goose family, and of Englishmanufacture.  I know both quill pens and steel pens.  I have had agreat many in my service, and I shall have many more still, when he,the man who stirs me up, comes and puts down what he takes from me.  Ishould like very much to know what will be the next thing he will takefrom me.""Ink tub!" said the Pen.Late in the evening the Poet returned home.  He had been at a concert,had heard a celebrated violin player, and was quite enchanted with hiswonderful performance.  It had been a complete gush of melody that hehad drawn from the instrument.  Sometimes it seemed like the gentlemurmur of a rippling stream, sometimes like the singing of birds,sometimes like the tempest sweeping through the mighty pine forests, hefancied he heard his own heart weep, but in the sweet tones that can beheard in a woman's charming voice.  It seemed as if not only thestrings of the violin made music, but its bridge, its pegs, and itssounding board.  It was astonishing!  The piece had been a mostdifficult one; but it seemed like play-as if the bow were but wanderingcapriciously over the strings.  Such was the appearance of facility,that everyone might have supposed he could do it.  The violin seemed tosound of itself, the bow to play of itself.  These two seemed to do itall.  One forgot the master who guided them, who gave them life andsoul.  Yes, they forgot the master; but the Poet thought of him.  Henamed him, and wrote down his thoughts as follows:"How foolish it would be of the violin and the bow, were they to bevain in their performance!  And yet this is what so often we of thehuman species are.  Poets, artists, those who make discoveries inscience, military and naval commanders -we are all proud of ourselves;and yet we are all only the instruments in our Lord's hands.  To Himalone be the glory!  We have nothing to arrogate to ourselves."This was what the Poet wrote; and he headed it with: "The Master andthe Instruments.""Well, madam," said the Pen to the Inkstand when they were again alone,"you heard him read aloud what I had written.""Yes, what I gave you to write," said the Ink-stand.  "It was a hit atyou for your conceit.  Strange that you cannot see that people make afool of you!  I gave you that hit pretty cleverly.  I confess, though,it was rather malicious.""Inkholder!" cried the Pen."Writing stick!" cried the Inkstand.They both felt assured that they had answered well; and it is apleasant reflection that one has made a smart reply-one sleepscomfortably after it.  And they both went to sleep; but the Poet couldnot sleep.  His thoughts welded forth like the tones from the violin,trilling like pearls, rushing like a storm through the forest.  Herecognized the feeling of his own heart-he perceived the gleam from theeverlasting Master.To Him alone be the glory!CINDERELLARetold by Miss MulockTHERE was once an honest gentleman who took for his second wife a lady,the proudest and most disagreeable in the whole country.  She had twodaughters exactly like herself in all things.  He also had one littlegirl, who resembled her dead mother, the best woman in all the world.Scarcely had the second marriage taken place, than the stepmotherbecame jealous of the good qualities of the little girl who was sogreat a contrast to her own two daughters.  She gave her all the menialoccupations of the house; compelled her to wash the floors andstaircases; to dust the bedrooms, and clean the grates; and while hersisters occupied carpeted chambers hung with mirrors, where they couldsee themselves from head to foot, this poor little damsel was sent tosleep in an attic, on an old straw mattress, with only one chair andnot a looking-glass in the room.She suffered all in silence, not daring to complain to her father, whowas entirely ruled by his new wife.  When her daily work was done, sheused to sit down in the chimney corner among the ashes; from which thetwo sisters gave her the nickname of Cinderella.  But Cinderella,however, shabbily clad, was handsomer than they were with all theirfine clothes.It happened that the king's son gave a series of balls, to which wereinvited all the rank and fashion of the city, and among the rest thetwo elder sisters.  They were very proud and happy, and occupied theirwhole time in deciding what they should wear; a source of new troubleto Cinderella, whose duty it was to get up their fine linen and laces,and who never could please them however much she tried.  They talked ofnothing but their clothes."I," said the elder, "shall wear my velvet gown and my trimmings ofEnglish lace.""And I," added the younger, "will have but my ordinary silk petticoat,but I shall adorn it with an upper skirt of flowered brocade, and shallput on my diamond tiara, which is a great deal finer than anything ofyours."Here the elder sister grew angry, and the dispute began to run so highthat Cinderella, who was known to have excellent taste, was called uponto decide between them.  She gave them the best advice she could, andgently and submissively offered to dress them herself, and especiallyto arrange their hair, an accomplishment in which she excelled many anoted coiffeur.  The important evening came, and she exercised all herskill to adorn the two young ladies.  While she was combing out theelder's hair, this ill-natured girl said sharply, "Cinderella, do younot wish you were going to the ball?""Ah, madam" (they obliged her always to say madam), "you are onlymocking me; it is not my fortune to have any such pleasure.""You are right; people would only laugh to see a little cinder wench ata ball."Any other than Cinderella would have dressed the hair all awry, but shewas good, and dressed it perfectly even and smooth, and as prettily asshe could.The sisters had scarcely eaten for two days, and had broken a dozenstaylaces a day, in trying to make themselves slender; but to-nightthey broke a dozen more, and lost their tempers over and over againbefore they had completed their toilet.  When at last the happy momentarrived, Cinderella followed them to the coach; after it had whirledthem away, she sat down by the kitchen fire and cried.Immediately her godmother, who was a fairy, appeared beside her.  "Whatare you crying for, my little maid?""Oh, I wish-I wish-"  Her sobs stopped her."You wish to go to the ball; isn't it so? "Cinderella nodded."Well then, be a good girl, and you shall go.  First run into thegarden and fetch me the largest pumpkin you can find."Cinderella did not comprehend what this had to do with her going to theball, but being obedient and obliging, she went.  Her godmother tookthe pumpkin, and having scooped out all its inside, struck it with herwand; it became a splendid gilt coach, lined with rose-colored satin."Now fetch me the mousetrap out of the pantry, my dear."Cinderella brought it; it contained six of the fattest, sleekest mice.The fairy lifted up the wire door, and as each mouse ran out she struckit and changed it into a beautiful black horse."But what shall I do for your coachman, Cinderella?"Cinderella suggested that she had seen a large black rat in the rattrap, and he might do for want of better."You are right; go and look again for him."He was found; and the fairy made him into a most respectable coachman,with the finest whiskers imaginable.  She afterward took six lizardsfrom behind the pumpkin frame, and changed them into six footmen, allin splendid livery, who immediately jumped up behind the carriage, asif they had been footmen all their days.  "Well, Cinderella, now youcan go to the ball.""What, in these clothes?" said Cinderella piteously, looking down onher ragged frock.Her godmother laughed, and touched her also with the wand; at which herwretched threadbare jacket became stiff with gold, and sparkling withjewels; her woolen petticoat lengthened into a gown of sweeping satin,from underneath which peeped out her little feet, no longer bare, butcovered with silk stockings, and the prettiest glass slippers in theworld.  "Now, Cinderella, depart; but remember, if you stay one instantafter midnight, your carriage will become a pumpkin, your coachman arat, your horses mice, and your footmen lizards; while you, yourself,will be the little cinder wench you were an hour ago."Cinderella promised without fear, her heart was so full of joy.Arrived at the palace, the king's son, whom some one, probably thefairy, had told to await the coming of an uninvited princess, whomnobody knew, was standing at the entrance, ready to receive her.  Heoffered her his hand, and led her with the utmost courtesy through theassembled guests, who stood aside to let her pass, whispering to oneanother, "Oh, how beautiful she is!"  It might have turned the head ofanyone but poor Cinderella, who was so used to be despised, that shetook it all as if it were something happening in a dream.Her triumph was complete; even the old king said to the queen, thatnever since her majesty's young days had he seen so charming andelegant a person.  All the court ladies scanned her eagerly, clothesand all, determining to have theirs made next day of exactly the samepattern.  The king's son himself led her out to dance, and she dancedso gracefully that he admired her more and more.  Indeed, at supper,which was fortunately early, his admiration quite took away hisappetite.  For Cinderella, herself, with an involuntary shyness, soughtout her sisters; placed herself beside them and offered them all sortsof civil attentions, which coming as they supposed from a stranger, andso magnificent a lady, almost overwhelmed them with delight.While she was talking with them, she heard the clock strike a quarterto twelve, and making a courteous adieu to the royal family, shereentered her carriage, escorted tenderly by the king's son, andarrived in safety at her own door.  There she found her godmother, whosmiled approval; and of whom she begged permission to go to a secondball, the following night, to which the queen had earnestly invitedher.While she was talking, the two sisters were heard knocking at the gate,and the fairy godmother vanished, leaving Cinderella sitting in thechimney corner, rubbing her eves and pretending to be very sleepy."Ah," cried the eldest sister maliciously, "it has been the mostdelightful ball, and there was present the most beautiful princess Iever saw, who was so exceedingly polite to us both.""Was she?" said Cinderella indifferently; "and who might she be?""Nobody knows, though everybody would give their eyes to know,especially the king's Son.""Indeed!" replied Cinderella, a little more interested; "I should liketo see her.  Miss Javotte"- that was the elder sister's name-"will younot let me go to-morrow, and lend me your yellow gown that you wear onSundays?""What, lend my yellow gown to a cinder wench!  I am not so mad asthat;" at which refusal Cinderella did not complain, for if her sisterreally had lent her the gown, she would have been considerablyembarrassed.The next night came, and the two young ladies, richly dressed indifferent toilets, went to the ball.Cinderella, more splendidly attired and beautiful than ever, followedthem shortly after.  "Now remember twelve o'clock," was her godmother'sparting speech; and she thought she certainly should.  But the prince'sattentions to her were greater even than the first evening, and in thedelight of listening to his pleasant conversation, time slipped byunperceived.  While she was sitting beside him in a lovely alcove, andlooking at the moon from under a bower of orange blossoms, she heard aclock strike the first stroke of twelve.  She started up, and fled awayas lightly as a deer.Amazed, the prince followed, but could not catch her.  Indeed he missedhis lovely princess altogether, and only saw running out of the palacedoors, a little dirty lass whom he had never beheld before, and of whomhe certainly would never have taken the least notice.  Cinderellaarrived at home breathless and weary, ragged and cold, withoutcarriage, or footman or coachman; the only remnant of her pastmagnificence being one of her little glass slippers-the other she haddropped in the ballroom as she ran away.When the two sisters returned, they were full of this strangeadventure, how the beautiful lady had appeared at the ball morebeautiful than ever, and enchanted everyone who looked at her; and howas the clock was striking twelve she had suddenly risen up and fledthrough the ballroom, disappearing no one knew how or where, anddropping one of her glass slippers behind her in her flight.  How theking's son had remained inconsolable, until he chanced to pick up thelittle glass slipper, which he carried away in his pocket, and was seento take it out continually, and look at it affectionately, with the airof a man very much in love; in fact, from his behavior during theremainder of the evening, all the court and royal family were convincedthat he had become desperately enamored of the wearer of the littleglass slipper.Cinderella listened in silence, turning her face to the kitchen fire,and perhaps it was that which made her look so rosy, but nobody evernoticed or admired her at home, so it did not signify, and next morningshe went to her weary work again just as before.A few days after, the whole city was attracted by the sight of a heraldgoing round with a little glass slipper in his hand, publishing with aflourish of trumpets, that the king's son ordered this to be fitted onthe foot of every lady in the kingdom, and that he wished to marry thelady whom it fitted best, or to whom it and the fellow slipperbelonged.  Princesses, duchesses, countesses, and simple gentlewomenall tried it on, but being a fairy slipper, it fitted nobody; andbesides, nobody could produce its fellow slipper, which lay all thetime safely in the pocket of Cinderella's old linsey gown.At last the herald came to the house of the two sisters, and thoughthey well knew neither of themselves was the beautiful lady, they madeevery attempt to get their clumsy feet into the glass slipper, but invain."Let me try it on," said Cinderella from the chimney corner."What, you?" cried the others, bursting into shouts of laughter; butCinderella only smiled, and held out her hand.Her sisters cou1d not prevent her, since the command was that everyyoung maiden in the city should try on the slipper, in order that nochance might be left untried, for the prince was nearly breaking hisheart; and his father and mother were afraid that though a prince, hewould actually die for love of the beautiful unknown lady.So the herald bade Cinderella sit down on a three-legged stool in thekitchen, and himself put the slipper on her pretty little foot, whichit fitted exactly; she then drew from her pocket the fellow slipper,which she also put on, and stood up-for with the touch of the magicshoes all her dress was changed likewise-no longer the poor despisedcinder wench, but the beautiful lady whom the king's son loved.Her sisters recognized her at once.  Filled with astonishment, mingledwith no little alarm, they threw themselves at her feet, begging herpardon for all their former unkindness.  She raised and embraced them;told them she forgave them with all her heart, and only hoped theywould love her always.  Then she departed with the herald to the king'spalace, and told her whole story to his majesty and the royal family,who were not in the least surprised, for everybody believed in fairies,and everybody longed to have a fairy godmother.For the young prince, he found her more lovely and lovable than ever,and insisted upon marrying her immediately.  Cinderella never went homeagain, but she sent for her two sisters to the palace, and with theconsent of all parties married them shortly after to two rich gentlemenof the court.LITTLE RED RIDING-HOODBy Charles PerraultONCE upon a time there lived in a certain village a little countrygirl, the prettiest creature ever seen.  Her mother was very fond ofher, and her grandmother doted on her still more.  This good woman hadmade for her a little red riding-hood, which became the girl so wellthat everybody called her Little Red Riding-Hood.One day her mother, having made some custards, said to her:"Go, my dear, and see how thy grandmamma does, for I hear she has beenvery ill; carry her a custard and this little pot of butter."Little Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother,who lived in another village.As she was going through the wood she met with Gaffer Wolf, who had avery great mind to eat her up, but he durst not, because of some fagotmakers hard by in the forest.  He asked her whither she was going.  Thepoor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stop and listento a wolf, said to him:"I am going to see my grandmamma and carry her a custard and a littlepot of butter from my mamma.""Does she live far off?" said the Wolf."Oh!  yes," answered Little Red Riding-Hood; "it is beyond that millyou see there, at the first house in the village.""Well," said the Wolf, "I'll go and see her, too.  I'll go this way andyou go that, and we shall see who will be there soonest."The Wolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the nearest way, andthe little girl went by the longest, diverting herself in gatheringnuts, running after butterflies, and making nosegays of such littleflowers as she met with.  The Wolf was not long before he got to theold woman's house.  He knocked at the door-tap, tap."Who's there?""Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood," replied the Wolf, imitatingher voice; "who has brought you a custard and a little pot of buttersent you by mamma."The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was ill, cried out:"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and he fell upon thegood woman and ate her up in a moment, for it was above three days thathe had not touched a bit.  He then shut the door and went into thegrandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding-Hood, who came some timeafterward and knocked at the door-tap, tap."Who's there?"Little Red Riding-Hood, hearing the big voice of the Wolf, was at firstafraid; but believing her grandmother had got a cold and was hoarse,answered:'Tis your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood, who has brought you acustard and a little pot of butter mamma sends you."The Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could:"Pull the bobbin and the latch will go up."Little Red Riding-Hood pulled the bobbin and the door opened.The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under thebedclothes:"Put the custard and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and comeand lie down with me."Little Red Riding-Hood undressed herself and went into bed, where,being greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, she said to her:"Grandmamma, what great arms you've got!""That is the better to hug thee, my dear.""Grandmamma, what great legs you've got!""The better to run, my child.""Grandmamma, what great ears you've got!""The better to hear, my child!""Grandmamma, what great eyes you've got!""The better to see, my child.""Grandmamma, what great teeth you've got!""To eat thee up!"And saying these words, the wicked Wolf fell upon Little Red Riding-Hood and ate her all up.THE STORY OF THE THREE BEARSBy Robert SoutheyONCE upon a time there were three Bears, who lived together in a houseof their own in a wood.  One of them was a Little, Small, Wee Bear; andone was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great, Huge Bear.They had each a pot for their porridge, a little pot for the Little,Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized pot for the Middle Bear; and agreat pot for the Great, Huge Bear.  And they had each a chair to sitin: a little chair for the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sizedchair for the Middle Bear; and a great chair for the Great, Huge Bear.And they had each a bed to sleep in: a little bed for the Little,Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle Bear; and agreat bed for the Great, Huge Bear.One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast andpoured it into their porridge pots, they walked out into the wood whilethe porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths bybeginning too soon to eat it.  And while they were walking a little oldwoman came to the house.  She could not have been a good, honest, oldwoman; for, first, she looked in at the window, and then she peeped inat the keyhole, and, seeing nobody in the house, she lifted the latch.The door was not fastened, because the bears were good bears, who didnobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them.  Sothe little old woman opened the door and went in; and well pleased shewas when she saw the porridge on the table.  If she had been a goodlittle old woman she would have waited till the bears came home, andthen, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast, for they weregood hears-a little rough or so, as the manner of bear's is, but forall that very good-natured and hospitable.  But she was an impudent,bad old woman, and set about helping herself.So first she tasted the porridge of the Great Huge Bear, and that wastoo hot for her; and she said a bad word about that.  And then shetasted the porridge of the Middle Bear, and that was too cold for her;and she said a bad word about that, too.  And then she went to theporridge of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and tasted that, and that wasneither too hot nor too cold, but just right; and she liked it so wellthat she ate it all up; but the naughty old woman said a bad word aboutthe little porridge pot, because it did not hold enough for her.Then the little old woman sat down in the chair of the Great, HugeBear, and that was too hard for her.  And then she sat down in thechair of the Middle Bear, and that was too soft for her.  And then shesat down in the chair of the Little Small, Wee Bear, and that wasneither too hard nor too soft, but just right.  So she seated herselfin it, and there she sat till the bottom of the chair came out, anddown came she, plump upon the ground.  And the naughty old woman saidwicked words about that, too.Then the little old woman went upstairs into the bedchamber in whichthe three Bears slept.  And first she lay down upon the bed of theGreat, Huge Bear, but that was too high at the head for her.  And nextshe lay down upon the bed of the Middle Bear, and that was too high atthe foot for her.  And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little,Small, Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at thefoot, but just right.  So she covered herself up comfortably, and laythere till she fell asleep.  By this time the three Bears thought theirporridge would be cool enough, so they came home to breakfast.  Now thelittle old woman had left the spoon of the Great, Huge Bear standing inhis porridge."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!"said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great gruff voice.  And when theMiddle Bear looked at his, he saw that the spoon was standing in it,too.  They were wooden spoons; if they had been silver ones the naughtyold woman would have put them in her pocket."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!"said the middle Bear, in his middle voice.Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoonin the porridge pot, but the porridge was all gone."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!"said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.Upon this the three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their houseand eaten up the Little, Small, Wee Bear's breakfast, began to lookabout them.  Now the little old woman had not put the hard cushionstraight when she rose from the chair of the Great, Huge Bear."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.And the little old woman had squatted down the soft cushion of theMiddle Bear."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.And you know what the little old woman had done to the third chair."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SAT THE BOTTOM OUT OFIT!"said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.Then the three bears thought it necessary that they should make furthersearch; so they went upstairs into their bedchamber.  Now the littleold woman had pulled the pillow of the Great, Huge Bear out of itsplace."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.And the little old woman had pulled the bolster of the Middle Bear outof its place."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there wasthe bolster in its place, and upon the pillow was the little oldwoman's ugly, dirty head-which was not in its place, for she had nobusiness there."SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED-AND HERE SHE IS!"said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.The little old woman had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruffvoice of the Great, Huge Bear, but she was so fast asleep that it wasno more to her than the moaning of wind or the rumbling of thunder.And she had heard the middle voice of the Middle Bear, but it was onlyas if she had heard some one speaking in a dream.  But when she heardthe little, small, wee voice of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, it was sosharp and so shrill that it awakened her at once.  Up she started, andwhen she saw the three bears on one side of the bed she tumbled herselfout at the other and ran to the window.  Now the window was open,because the Bears, like good, tidy bears as they were, always openedtheir bedchamber window when they got up in the morning.  Out thelittle old woman jumped, and whether she broke her neck in the fall orran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the woodand was taken up by the constable and sent to the House of Correctionfor a vagrant as she was, I cannot tell.  But the three Bears never sawanything more of her.PUSS IN BOOTSBy Charles PerraultA MILLER, dying, divided all his property between his three children.This was very easy, as he had nothing to leave but his mill, his ass,and his cat; so he made no will, and called in no lawyer.  The eldestson had the mill; the second, the ass; and the youngest, nothing butthe cat.  The young fellow was quite downcast at so poor a lot.  "Mybrothers," said he, "by putting their property together, may gain anhonest living, but there is nothing left for me except to die ofhunger, unless, indeed, I were to kill my cat and eat him, and make amuff of his skin."The cat, who heard all this, sat up on his four paws, and looking athim with a grave and wise air, said: "Master, I think you had betternot kill me; I shall be much more useful to you alive.""How so?" asked his master."You have but to give me a sack and a pair of boots, such as gentlemenwear when they go shooting, and you will find you are not so ill off asyou suppose."Now, though the young man did not much depend upon the cat's words,still he thought it rather surprising that a cat should speak at all.And he had before now seen him play a great many cunning tricks incatching rats and mice, so that it seemed advisable to trust him alittle further; especially as-poor young fellow-he had nobody else totrust.When the cat got his boots, he drew them on with a grand air, andslinging his sack over his shoulder, and drawing the cords of it roundhis neck, he marched bravely to a rabbit warren hard by, with which hewas well acquainted.  Then, putting some bran and lettuces into hisbag, and stretching himself out beside it as if he were dead, he waitedtill some fine, fat young rabbit, ignorant of the wickedness and deceitof the world, should peep into the sack to eat the food that wasinside.  This happened very shortly, for there are plenty of foolishyoung rabbits in every warren; and when one of them, who really was asplendid fat fellow, put his head inside, Master Puss drew the cordsimmediately, and took him and killed him without mercy.  Then, veryproud of his prey, he marched direct to the palace, and begged to speakwith the King.He was told to ascend to the apartment of his majesty, where, making alow bow, he said:  "Sire, here is a magnificent rabbit, killed in thewarren, which belongs to my lord the Marquis of Carabas, and which hetold me to offer humbly to your majesty.""Tell your master," replied the King, politely, "that I accept hispresent, and am very much obliged to him."Another time, Puss went out and hid himself and his sack in a wheatfield, and there caught two splendid fat partridges in the same manneras he had done the rabbit.  When he presented them to the King, with asimilar message as before, his majesty was so pleased that he orderedthe cat to be taken down into the kitchen and given something to eatand drink; where, while enjoying himself, the faithful animal did notcease to talk in the most cunning way of the large preserves andabundant game which belonged to his lord the Marquis of Carabas.One day, hearing that the King was intending to take a drive along theriverside with his daughter, the most beautiful princess in the world,Puss said to his master:  "Sir, if you would only follow my advice,your fortune is made.""Be it so," said the miller's son, who was growing disconsolate, andcared very little what he did:  "Say your say, cat.""It is but little," replied Puss, looking wise, as cats can.  "You haveonly to go and bathe in the river at a place which I shall show you,and leave all the rest to me.  Only remember that you are no longeryourself, but my lord the Marquis of Carabas.""Just so," said the miller's son, "it's all the same to me;" but he didas the cat told him.While he was bathing, the King and all the court passed by, and werestartled to hear loud cries of "Help! help!  my lord the Marquis ofCarabas is drowning."  The King put his head out of the carriage, andsaw nobody but the cat, who had at different times brought him so manypresents of game; however, he ordered his guards to fly quickly to thesuccor of my lord the Marquis of Carabas.  While they were pulling theunfortunate marquis out of the water, the cat came up, bowing, to theside of the King's carriage, and told a long and pitiful story aboutsome thieves who, while his master was bathing, had come and carriedaway all his clothes, so that it would be impossible for him to appearbefore his majesty and the illustrious princess."Oh, we will soon remedy that," answered the King, kindly andimmediately ordered one of the first officers of the household to rideback to the palace with all speed, and bring thence a supply of fineclothes for the young gentleman, who kept out of sight until theyarrived.  Then, being handsome and well-made, his new clothes becamehim so well, that he looked as if he had been a marquis all his days,and advanced with an air of respectful ease to offer his thanks to hismajesty.The King received him courteously, and the princess admired him verymuch.  Indeed, so charming did he appear to her, that she hinted to herfather to invite him into the carriage with them, which, you may besure the young man did not refuse.  The cat, delighted at the successof his scheme, went away as fast as he could, and ran so swiftly thathe kept a long way ahead of the royal carriage.  He went on and on,till he came to some peasants who were mowing in a meadow.  "Goodpeople," said he, in a very firm voice, "the King is coming past hereshortly, and if you do not say that the field you are mowing belongs tomy lord the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be chopped as small asmincemeat."So when the King drove by, and asked whose meadow it was where therewas such a splendid crop of hay, the mowers all answered, trembling,that it belonged to my lord the Marquis of Carabas."You have very fine land, marquis," said his majesty to the miller'sson, who bowed, and answered that "it was not a bad meadow, take italtogether."Then the cat came to a wheat field, where the reapers were reaping withall their might.  He bounced in upon them:  "The King is coming pastto-day, and if you do not tell him that this wheat belongs to my lordthe Marquis of Carabas, I will have you everyone chopped as small asmincemeat."  The reapers, very much alarmed, did as they were bid, andthe King congratulated the marquis upon possessing such beautifulfields, laden with such an abundant harvest.They drove on-the cat always running before and saying the same thingto everybody he met, that they were to declare that the whole countrybelonged to his master; so that even the King was astonished at thevast estate of my lord the Marquis of Carabas.But now the cat arrived at a great castle where dwelt an Ogre, to whombelonged all the land through which the royal carriage had beendriving.  This Ogre was a cruel tyrant, and his tenants and servantswere terribly afraid of him, which accounted for their being so readyto say whatever they were told to say by the cat, who had taken painsto inform himself all about the Ogre.  So, putting on the boldest facehe could assume, Puss marched up to the castle with his boots on, andasked to see the owner of it, saying that he was on his travels, butdid not wish to pass so near the castle of such a noble gentlemanwithout paying his respects to him.  When the Ogre heard this message,he went to the door, received the cat as civilly as an Ogre can, andbegged him to walk in and repose himself."Thank you, sir," said the cat; "but first I hope you will satisfy atraveler's curiosity.  I have heard in far countries of your manyremarkable qualities, and especially how you have the power to changeyourself into any sort of beast you choose-a lion, for instance, or anelephant.""That is quite true," replied the Ogre; "and lest you should doubt it Iwill immediately become a lion."He did so; and the cat was so frightened that he sprang up to the roofof the castle and hid himself in the gutter-a proceeding ratherinconvenient on account of his boots, which were not exactly fitted towalk with on tiles.  At length, perceiving that the Ogre had resumedhis original form, he came down again, and owned that he had been verymuch frightened."But, sir," said he, "it may be easy enough for such a big gentleman asyou to change himself into a large animal; I do not suppose you couldbecome a small one-a rat, or mouse, for instance.  I have heard thatyou can; still, for my part, I consider it quite impossible.""Impossible!" cried the other, indignantly.  "You shall see!" andimmediately the cat saw the Ogre no longer, but a little mouse runningalong on the floor.This was exactly what Puss wanted; and he fell upon him at once and atehim up.  So there was an end to the Ogre.By this time the King had arrived opposite the castle, and had a strongwish to go into it.  The cat, hearing the noise of the carriage wheels,ran forward in a great hurry, and, standing at the gate, said, in aloud voice:  "Welcome, sire, to the castle of my lord the Marquis ofCarabas.""What!" cried his majesty, very much surprised, "does the castle alsobelong to you?  Truly, marquis, you have kept your secret well up tothe last minute.  I have never seen anything finer than this courtyardand these battlements.  Let us go in, if you please."The marquis, without speaking, offered his hand to the princess to helpher to descend, and, standing aside that the King might enter first,followed his majesty to the great hall, where a magnificent dinner waslaid out, and where, without more delays they all sat down to feast.Before the banquet was over, the King, charmed with the good qualitiesof the Marquis of Carabas, said, bowing across the table at which theprincess and the miller's son were talking very confidentiallytogether:  "It rests with you, marquis, whether you will marry mydaughter.""I shall be only too happy," said the marquis, and the princess's cast-down eyes declared the same.So they were married the very next day, and took possession of theOgre's castle, and of everything that had belonged to him.As for the cat, he became at once a great lord, and had nevermore anyneed to run after mice, except for his own diversion.JACK THE GIANT-KILLERRetold by Joseph JacobsIN the reign of the famous King Arthur there lived in Cornwall a ladnamed Jack, who was a boy of a bold temper and took delight in hearingor reading of conjurers, giants, and fairies; and used to listeneagerly to the deeds of the knights of King Arthur's Round Table.In those days there lived on St. Michael's Mount, off Cornwall, a hugeGiant, eighteen feet high and nine feet round; his fierce and savagelooks were the terror of all who beheld him.He dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain, and used towade over to the mainland in search of prey, when he would throw half adozen oxen upon his back, and tie three times as many sheep and hogsround his waist, and march back to his own abode.The Giant had done this for many years when Jack resolved to destroyhim.Jack took a horn, a shovel, a pickaxe, his armor, and a dark lantern,and one winter's evening he went to the mount.  There he dug a pittwenty-two feet deep and twenty broad.  He covered the top over so asto make it look like solid ground.  He then blew such a blast on hishorn that the Giant awoke and came out of his den, crying out:  "Yousaucy villain, you shall pay for this!  I'll broil you for mybreakfast!"He had just finished, when, taking one step farther, he tumbledheadlong into the pit, and Jack struck him a blow on the head with hispickaxe which killed him.  Jack then returned home to cheer his friendswith the news.Another Giant, called Blunderbore, vowed to be revenged on Jack if everhe should have him in his power.This Giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely wood, andsome time after the death of Cormoran, Jack was passing through a wood,and, being weary, sat down and went to sleep.The Giant, passing by and seeing Jack, carried him to his castle, wherehe locked him up in a large room, the floor of which was covered withthe bodies, skulls, and bones of men and women.Soon after, the Giant went to fetch his brother, who was likewise aGiant, to take a meal off his flesh, and Jack saw with terror throughthe bars of his prison the two Giants approaching.Jack, perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord, took courage,and making a slip-knot at each end, he threw them over their heads, andtied it to the window-bars; he then pulled till he had choked them.When they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed themto the heart.Jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of Blunderbore andwent into the castle again.  He made a strict search through all therooms, and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair oftheir heads and almost starved to death.  They told him that theirhusbands had been killed by the Giants, who had then condemned them tobe starved to death."Ladies," said Jack, "I have put an end to the monster and his wickedbrother, and I give you this castle and all the riches it contains tomake some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt."  He then verypolitely gave them the keys of the castle and went farther on hisjourney to Wales.As Jack had but little money, he went on as fast as possible.  Atlength he came to a handsome house.Jack knocked at the door, when there came forth a Welsh Giant.  Jacksaid he was a traveler who had lost his way, on which the Giant madehim welcome and let him into a room where there was a good bed to sleepin.Jack took off his clothes quickly, but though he was weary he could notgo to sleep.  Soon after this he heard the Giant walking backward andforward in the next room and saying to himself:"Though here you shall lodge with me this night,You shall not see the morning light;My club shall dash your brains out quite!""Say you so?" thought Jack.  "Are these your tricks upon travelers?But I hope to prove as cunning as you are."  Then, getting out of bed,he groped about the room and at last found a thick tog of wood.  Helaid it in his own place in the bed, and then hid himself in a darkcorner of the room.The Giant, about midnight, entered the apartment, and with his bludgeonstruck many blows on the bed, in the very place where Jack had laid thelog; and then he went back to his own room, thinking he had broken allJack's bones.Early in the morning Jack put a bold face upon the matter and walkedinto the Giant's room to thank him for his lodging.  The Giant startedwhen he saw him, and began to stammer out:  "Oh! dear me; is it you?Pray, how did you sleep last night?  Did you hear or see anything inthe dead of the night?""Nothing worth speaking of," said Jack, carelessly; "a rat, I believe,gave me three or four slaps with its tail, and disturbed me a little;but I soon went to sleep again."The Giant wondered more and more at this; yet he did not answer a word,but went to bring two great bowls of hasty-pudding for their breakfast.Jack wanted to make the Giant believe that he could eat as much ashimself so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat andslip the hasty-pudding into this bag while he seemed to put it into hismouth.When breakfast was over he said to the Giant:  "Now I will show you afine trick.  I can cure all wounds with a touch; I could cut off myhead in one minute, and the next put it sound again on my shoulders.You shall see an example."  He then took hold of the knife, ripped upthe leathern bag, and all the hasty-pudding tumbled out upon the floor."Ods splutter hur nails!" cried the Welsh Giant, who was ashamed to beoutdone by such a little fellow as Jack, "hur can do that hurself;" sohe snatched up the knife, plunged it into his own stomach, and in amoment dropped down dead.Jack, having hitherto been successful in all his undertakings, resolvednot to be idle in future; he therefore furnished himself with a horse,a cap of knowledge, a sword of sharpness, shoes of swiftness, and aninvisible coat, the better to perform the wonderful enterprises thatlay before him.He traveled over high hills, and on the third day he came to a largeand spacious forest through which his road lay.  Scarcely had heentered the forest when he beheld a monstrous Giant dragging along bythe hair of their heads a handsome Knight and his lady.  Jack alightedfrom his horse, and tying him to an oak-tree, put on his invisiblecoat, under which he carried his sword of sharpness.When he came up to the Giant he made several strokes at him, but couldnot reach his body, but wounded his thighs in several places; and atlength, putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might,he cut off both his legs.  Then Jack, setting his foot upon his neck,plunged his sword into the Giant's body, when the monster gave a groanand expired.The Knight and his 1ady thanked Jack for their deliverance, and invitedhim to their house to receive a proper reward for his services.  "No,"Said Jack, "I cannot be easy till I find out this monster'shabitation."  So taking the Knight's directions, he mounted his horseand soon after came in sight of another Giant, who was sitting on ablock of timber waiting for his brother's return.Jack alighted from his horse, and, putting on his invisible coat,approached and aimed a blow at the Giant's head, but missing his aim heonly cut off his nose.  On this the Giant seized his club and laidabout him most unmercifully."Nay," said Jack, "if this be the case I'd better dispatch you!"  Sojumping upon the block, he stabbed him in the back, when he droppeddown dead.Jack then proceeded on his journey, and traveled over hills and dalestill, arriving at the foot of a high mountain, he knocked at the doorof a lonely house, when an old man let him in.When Jack was seated the hermit thus addressed him:  "My son, on thetop of this mountain is an enchanted castle, kept by the GiantGalligantus and a vile magician.  I lament the fate of a duke'sdaughter, whom they seized as she was walking in her father's garden,and brought hither transformed into a deer."Jack promised that in the morning, at the risk of his life, he wouldbreak the enchantment; and after a sound sleep he rose early, put onhis invisible coat, and got ready for the attempt.When he had climbed to the top of the mountain he saw two fierygriffins; but he passed between them without the least fear of danger,for they could not see him because of his invisible coat.  On thecastle gate he found a golden trumpet, under which were written theselines:Whoever can this trumpet blowShall cause the giant's overthrow.As soon as Jack had read this he seized the trumpet and blew a shrillblast, which made the gates fly open and the very castle itselftremble.The Giant and the conjurer now knew that their wicked course was at anend, and they stood biting their thumbs and shaking within fear.  Jack,with his sword of sharpness, soon killed the Giant, and the magicianwas then carried away by a whirlwind; and every knight and beautifullady who had been changed into birds and beasts returned to theirproper shapes.  The castle vanished away like smoke, and the head ofthe Giant Galligantus was sent to King Arthur.The knights and ladies rested that night at the old man's hermitage,and next day they set out for the Court.  Jack then went up to the Kingand gave his Majesty an account of all his fierce battles.Jack's fame had now spread through the whole country, and at the King'sdesire the Duke gave him his daughter in marriage, to the joy of allhis kingdom.  After this the King gave him a large estate, on which heand his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and contentment.TOM THUMBRetold by Joseph JacobsIN the days of the great Prince Arthur, there lived a mighty magician,named Merlin, the most learned and skillful enchanter the world hasever seen.This famous magician, who could take any form he pleased, wastravelling about as a poor  beggar, and being very tired he stopped atthe cottage of a Ploughman to rest himself, and asked for some food.The countryman bade him welcome, and his wife, who was a very good-hearted woman, brought him some milk in a wooden bowl and some coarsebrown bread on a platter.Merlin was much pleased with the kindness of the Ploughman and hiswife; but he could not help noticing that though everything was neatand comfortable in the cottage, they both seemed to be very unhappy.He therefore asked them why they were so melancholy, and learned thatthey were miserable because they had no children.The Poor Woman said, with tears in her eves:  "I should be the happiestcreature in the world if I had a son although he was no bigger than myhusband's thumb."Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a man'sthumb that he determined to grant the Poor Woman's wish.  Accordingly,in a short time after, the Ploughman's wife had a son, who, wonderfulto relate!  was not a bit bigger than his father's thumb.The Queen of the fairies, wishing to see the little fellow, came in atthe window, while the mother was sitting up in bed admiring him.  TheQueen kissed the child, and, giving it the name of Tom Thumb, sent forsome of the fairies, who dressed her little godson according to herorders:An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown;His shirt of web by spiders spun;With jacket wove of thistle's down;His trousers were of feathers done.His stockings, of apple rind, they tieWith eyelash from his mother's eye:His shoes were made of mouse's skin,Tann'd with the downy hair within.Tom never grew any larger than his father's thumb, but as he got olderhe became very cunning and full of tricks.  When he was old enough toplay with the boys, and had lost all his own cherry stones, he used tocreep into the bags of his play-fellows, fill his pockets, and, gettingout without their noticing him, would again join in the game.One day, as he was coming out of a bag of cherry stones, where he hadbeen stealing as usual, the boy to whom it belonged chanced to see him."Ah, ah! my little Tommy," said the boy, "so I have caught you stealingmy cherry stones at last, and you shall be rewarded for your thievishtricks."  On saying this, he drew the string tight round his neck, andgave the bag such a hearty shake that poor little Tom's legs, thighsand body were sadly bruised.  He roared out with pain and begged to belet out, promising never to steal again.A short time afterwards his mother was making a batter pudding, andTom, being anxious to see how it was made, climbed up to the edge ofthe bowl; but his foot slipped, and he plumped over head and ears intothe batter, without his mother noticing him, who stirred him into thepudding-bag, and put him in the pot to boil.The batter filled Tom's mouth, and prevented him from crying; but, uponfeeling the hot water, he kicked and struggled so much in the pot thathis mother thought that the pudding was bewitched, and, pulling it outof the pot, she threw it outside the door.  A poor tinker, who waspassing by, lifted up the pudding, put it in his bag, and walked off.As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of the batter, he began to cryaloud, which so frightened the tinker that he flung down the puddingand ran away.  The pudding being broke to pieces by the fall, Tom creptout covered all over with the batter, and walked home.  His mother, whowas very sorry to see her darling in such a woeful state, put him intoa teacup and soon washed off the batter; after which she kissed him andlaid him in bed.Soon after the adventure of the pudding, Tom's mother went to milk hercow in the meadow, and she took him along with her.  As the wind wasvery high, for fear of being blown away, she tied him to a thistle witha piece of fine thread.  The cow soon observed Tom's oak-leaf hat, andliking the appearance of it, took poor Tom and the thistle at onemouthful.  While the cow was chewing the thistle Tom was afraid of hergreat teeth, which threatened to crush him in pieces, and he roared outas loud as he could:  "Mother, mother!""Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?" said his mother."Here, mother," replied he, "in the red cow's mouth."His mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised atthe odd noise in her throat, opened her mouth and let Tom drop out.Fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to theground, or he would have been dreadfully hurt.  She then put Tom in herbosom and ran home with him.Tom's father made him a whip of barley straw to drive the cattle with,and having one day gone into the fields, Tom slipped a foot and rolledinto the furrow.  A raven, which was flying over, picked him up andflew with him over the sea, and there dropped him.A large fish swallowed Tom the moment he fell into the sea, which wassoon after caught and bought for the table of King Arthur.  When theyopened the fish in order to cook it, every one was astonished atfinding such a little boy, and Tom was quite delighted at being freeagain.  They carried him to the King, who made Tom his dwarf, and hesoon became a great favorite at court; for by his tricks and gambols henot only amused the King and Queen, but also the Knights of the RoundTable.It is said that when the King rode out on horseback he often took Tomalong with him, and if a shower came on he used to creep into hisMajesty's waistcoat pocket, where he slept till the rain was over.King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents, wishing to know ifthey were as small as he was, and whether they were well off.  Tom toldthe King that his father and mother were as tall as anybody about thecourt, but in rather poor circumstances.  On hearing this, the Kingcarried Tom to his treasury, the place where he kept all his money, andtold him to take as much money as he could carry home to his parents,which made the poor little fellow caper with joy.  Tom went immediatelyto procure a purse which was made of a water-bubble, and then returnedto the treasury, where he received a silver three-penny piece to putinto it.Our little hero had some difficulty in lifting the burden upon hisback; but he at last succeeded in getting it placed and set forward onhis journey.  Without meeting with any accident, and after restinghimself more than a hundred times by the way, in two days and twonights he reached his father's house in safety.Tom had traveled forty-eight hours with a huge silver piece on hisback, and was almost tired to death, when his mother ran out to meethim and carried him into the house.  But he soon returned to court.As Tom's clothes had suffered much in the batter pudding and the insideof the fish, his Majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes, and to bemounted as a knight on a mouse.Of Butterfly's wings his shirt was made,His boots of chicken's hide;And by a nimble fairy blade,Well learned in the tailoring trade,His clothing was supplied.A needle dangled by his side;A dapper mouse he used to ride,Thus strutted Tom in stately pride!It was certainly very amusing to see him in this dress and mounted onthe mouse, as he rode out a-hunting with the King and nobility, whowere all ready to expire with laughter at Tom and his fine prancingcharioteer.The King was so charmed with his address that he ordered a little chairto be made, in order that Tom might sit upon his table, and also apalace of gold, a span high, with a door an inch wide, to live in.  Healso gave him a coach, drawn by six small mice.The Queen was so enraged at the honors conferred on Sir Thomas that sheresolved to ruin him, and told the King that the little knight had beensaucy to her.The King sent for Tom in great haste, but being fully aware of thedanger of royal anger, he crept into an empty snail shell, where he layfor a long time until he was almost starved with hunger; at last heventured to peep out, and seeing a fine large butterfly on the ground,near the place of his concealment, he got close to it and jumpingastride on it was carried up into the, air.  The butterfly flew withhim from tree to tree and from field to field, at last returned to thecourt, where the King and nobility all strove to catch him; but at lastpoor Tom fell from his seat into a watering-pot, in which he was almostdrowned.When the Queen saw him she was in a rage, and said he should bebeheaded; and he was again put into a mouse trap until the time of hisexecution.However, a cat, observing something alive in the trap, patted it abouttill the wires broke, and set Thomas at liberty.The King received Tom again into favor, which he did not live to enjoy,for a large spider one day attacked him; and although he drew his swordand fought well, yet the spider's poisonous breath at last overcamehim.King Arthur and his whole court were so sorry at the loss of theirlittle favorite that they went into mourning and raised a fine whitemarble monument over his grave with the following epitaph:Here lies Tom Thumb, King Arthur's knight,Who died by a spider's cruel bite.He was well known in Arthur's court,Where he afforded gallant sport;He rode a tilt and tournament,And on a mouse a-hunting went.Alive he filled the court with mirth;His death to sorrow soon gave birth.Wipe, wipe your eyes, and shake your headAnd cry,-Alas!  Tom Thumb is dead!BLUE BEARDBy Charles PerraultTHERE was once a man who had fine houses, both in town and country, adeal of silver and gold plate, embroidered furniture, and coachesgilded all over with gold.  But this man was so unlucky as to have ablue beard, which made him so ugly that all the women and girls ranaway from him.One of his neighbors, a lady of quality, had two daughters who wereperfect beauties.  He asked her for one of them in marriage, butneither of them could bear the thought of marrying a man who had a bluebeard.  Besides, he had already been married several times, and nobodyever knew what became of his wives.In the hope of making them like him, Blue Beard took them, with theirmother and three or four ladies of their acquaintance, and other youngpeople of the neighborhood, to one of his country houses, where theystayed a whole week.There were parties of pleasure, hunting, fishing, dancing, mirth, andfeasting all the time.  Nobody went to bed, but all passed the time inmerry-making and joking with one another.  Everything succeeded so wellthat the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house was avery civil gentleman.  And his beard not so very blue after all.As soon as they returned home, the marriage took place.  About a monthafterward Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take ajourney for six weeks, about affairs of great consequence, desiring herto amuse herself in his absence, to send for her friends andacquaintances, to carry them in to the country if she pleased, and tohave a good time wherever she was."Here," said he, "are the keys of the two great wardrobes wherein Ihave my best furniture; these are of my silver and gold plate, which isnot every day in use; these open my strong boxes, which hold my money,both gold and silver; these my caskets of jewels; and this is themaster key to all my apartments.  This little one here is the key ofthe closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor.  Openthem all; go into all and every one of them, except that little closet,which I forbid you; if you happen to open it, there's nothing but whatyou may expect from my just anger and resentment."She promised to observe exactly whatever he ordered; so, havingembraced her, he got into his coach and proceeded on his journey.Her neighbors and good friends did not wait to be sent for, so greatwas their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house.  Theyran through all the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were all sofine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another.After that they went up into the two great rooms, where were the bestand richest furniture; they could not sufficiently admire the numberand beauty of the tapestries, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables,and looking-glasses, in which you might see yourself from head to foot;some of them were framed with glass, others with silver, plain andgilded, the finest and most magnificent ever seen.They ceased not to compliment and envy their friend, but she was somuch pressed by her curiosity to open the closet on the ground floorthat, without considering that it was very uncivil to leave hercompany, she went down a little back staircase with such haste that shehad twice or thrice like to have broken her neck.Arriving at the closet door, she hesitated, thinking of her husband'sorders and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she wasdisobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcomeit.  She took the little key and opened it, trembling, but could not atfirst see anything plainly because the windows were shut.  After somemoments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered withblood, in which lay the bodies of several dead women, ranged againstthe walls.  (These were the wives whom Blue Beard had married andmurdered, one after another.)  She thought she would die for fear, andthe key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand.After having somewhat recovered from the shock, she took up the key,locked the door, and went upstairs to her bedroom to rest.  Havingobserved that the key of the closet was stained with blood, she triedtwo or three times to wipe it off, but the stain would not come out; invain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand, the bloodstill remained, for the key was magical; when the blood was removedfrom one side it came again on the other.Blue Beard returned from his journey the same evening, and said he hadreceived letters upon the road informing him that the affair he wentabout was ended to his advantage.  His wife did all she could toconvince him she was extremely glad of his speedy return.Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but withsuch a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened."What!" said he, "is not the key of my closet among the rest?""I must certainly," said she, "have left it above upon the table.""Fail not," said Blue Beard, "to bring it to me presently."After several goings backward and forward she was forced to bring himthe key.  Blue Beard attentively considered it and said to his wife:"How comes this blood upon the key?""I do not know," cried the poor woman, paler than death."You do not know!" replied Blue Beard.  "I very well know.  You wereresolved to go into the closet, were you not?  Very well, madam; youshall go in and take your place among the ladies you saw there.Upon this she threw herself at her husband's feet, and begged hispardon with all the signs of a true repentance, vowing that she wouldnever again be disobedient.  She would have melted a rock, so beautifuland sorrowful was she; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any rock!"You must die, madam," said he, "and that; very soon.""Since I must die," answered she, her eyes bathed in tears, "give mesome little time to say my prayers.""I give you," replied Blue Beard, "half a quarter of an hour, but notone moment more."When she was alone she called out to her sister:"Sister Anne, go up, I beg you, on top of the tower and see if mybrothers are not coming; they promised me that they would come to-day,and if you see them, give them a sign to make haste."Sister Anne went up on the top of the tower, and the poor afflictedwife cried out from time to time:"Anne, sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?"And sister Anne replied:"I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, whichlooks green."In the meanwhile Blue Beard, holding a great saber in his hand, criedout as loud as he could bawl to his wife:"Come down instantly, or I shall come up after you.""One moment longer, if you please," said his wife; and then she criedout softly:  "Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see anybody coming?"And sister Anne answered:"I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which isgreen.""Come down quickly," shouted Blue Beard, "or I will come up after you.""I am coming," answered his wife; and then she cried:  "Anne, sisterAnne, dost thou not see any one coming?""I see," replied sister Anne, "a great dust, which comes on this side.""Are they my brothers?""Alas!  no, my dear sister, I see a flock of sheep.""Will you not come down?' roared Blue Beard."One moment longer," said his wife, and then she cried out:  "Anne,sister Anne, dost thou see nobody coming?""I see," said she, "two horsemen, but they are yet a great way off.""God be praised!" replied the poor wife joyfully; "they are mybrothers; I will make them a sign, as well as I can, for them to makehaste."Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole housetremble.  The distressed wife came down and threw herself at his feet,all in tears, with her hair about her shoulders."That will not help you," says Blue Beard; "you must die;" then, takinghold of her hair with one hand, and lifting up the sword with theother, he was going to cut off her head.  The poor lady, turning to himand looking at him with dying eyes, begged him to give her one littlemoment more."No, no," said he; "say your prayers," and was just about to strike...At this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate thatBlue Beard looked up in alarm.  The gate was opened and two horsemenentered, who drew their swords and ran directly at Blue Beard.  He knewthem to be his wife's brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer;so that he quickly ran to save himself; but the two brothers pursued soclose that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of theporch, and ran their swords through his body and left him dead.  Thepoor wife was almost as dead as her husband, and had not strengthenough to rise and welcome her brothers.Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all hisestate.  She made use of one part of it to marry her sister Anne to ayoung gentleman who had loved her a long while; another part to buycaptains' commissions for her brothers, and the rest to marry herselfto a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the unhappy time shehad passed with Blue Beard.THE BRAVE LITTLE TAILORAnonymousONE summer's day a little Tailor sat on his table by the window in thebest of spirits and sewed for dear life.  As he was sitting thus apeasant woman came down the street, calling out:  "Good jam to sell!good jam to sell!"  This sounded sweetly in the Tailor's ears; he puthis little head out of the window and shouted:  "Up here, my goodwoman, and you'll find a willing customer!"  The woman climbed up thethree flights of stairs with her heavy basket to the tailor's room, andhe made her spread out the pots in a row before him.  He examined themall, lifted them up and smelt them, and said at last:  "This jam seemsgood; weigh me four ounces of it, my good woman; and even if it's aquarter of a pound I won't stick at it."  The woman, who had hoped tofind a good market, gave him what he wanted, but went away grumblingwrathfully.  "Now Heaven shall bless this jam for my use," cried thelittle Tailor, "and it shall sustain and strengthen me."  He fetchedsome bread out of a cupboard, cut a round off the loaf, and spread thejam on it.  "That will taste good," he said; "but I'll finish thatwaistcoat first before I take a bite."  He placed the bread beside him,went on sewing, and out of the lightness of his heart kept on makinghis stitches bigger and bigger.  In the meantime the smell of the sweetjam rose to the ceiling, where swarms of flies were gathered, andattracted them to such an extent that they swarmed on to it in masses."Ha! who invited you?" said the Tailor, and chased the unwelcome guestsaway.  But the flies, who didn't understand English, refused to letthemselves be warned off, and returned again in even greater numbers.At last the Tailor, losing all patience, reached out of his chimney-corner for a duster, and exclaiming, "Wait, and I'll give it to you!"he beat them mercilessly with it.  When he left off he counted theslain, and no fewer than seven lay dead before him with outstretchedlegs.  "What a brave fellow I am!" said he, and was filled withadmiration at his own courage.  "The whole town must know about this;"and in great haste the little Tailor cut out a girdle, hemmed it, andembroidered on it in big letters, "Seven at a blow."  "What did I say,the town? no, the whole world shall hear of it," he said; and his heartbeat for joy as a lamb wags his tail.The Tailor strapped the girdle round his waist and set out into thewide world, for he considered his workroom too small a field for hisbravery.  Before he set forth he looked round about him, to see ifthere was anything in the house he could take with him on his journey;but he found nothing except an old cheese, which he took possession of.In front of the house he observed a bird that had been caught in somebushes, and this he put into his wallet beside the cheese.  Then hewent on his way merrily, and being light and quick he never felt tired.His way led up a hill on the top of which sat a powerful Giant, who wascalmly surveying the landscape.  The little Tailor went up to him, andgreeting him cheerfully said: "Good-day, friend; there you sit at yourease viewing the whole wide world.  I'm just on my way there.  What doyou say to accompanying me?"  The Giant looked contemptuously at theTailor, and said:  "What a poor, wretched little creature you are!""That's a good joke," answered the little Tailor, and unbuttoning hiscoat he showed the Giant the girdle.  "There, now, you can read whatsort of a fellow I am."  The Giant read:  "Seven at a blow," andthinking they were human beings the Tailor had slain, he had a certainrespect for the little man.  But first he thought he'd test him; sotaking up a stone in his hand, he squeezed it till some drops of waterran out.  "Now you do the same," said the Giant, "if you really wish tobe thought strong."  "Is that all?"  said the little Tailor; "that'schild's play to me."   So he dived into his wallet, brought out thecheese, and pressed it till the whey ran out.  "My squeeze was betterthan yours," said he.  The Giant didn't know what to say, for hecouldn't have believed it of the little fellow.  To prove him again,the Giant lifted a stone and threw it so high that the eye could hardlyfollow it.  "Now, my little dwarf, let me see you do that."  "Wellthrown," said the Tailor; "but, after all, your stone fell to theground; I'll throw one that won't come down at all."  He dived into hiswallet again, and grasping the bird in his hand he threw it up into theair.  The bird, enchanted to be free, soared up into the sky, and flewaway never to return.  "Well, what do you think of that little piece ofbusiness, friend?" asked the Tailor.  "You can certainly throw," saidthe Giant; "but now let's see if you can carry a proper weight."  Withthese words he led the Tailor to a huge oak-tree which had been felledto the ground, and said:  "If you are strong enough, help me carry thetree out of the wood."  "Most certainly," said the little Tailor: "justyou take the trunk on your shoulder; I'll bear the top and branches,which is certainly the heaviest part."  The Giant laid the trunk on hisshoulder, but the Tailor sat at his ease among the branches; and theGiant, who couldn't see what was going on behind him, had to carry thewhole tree, and the little Tailor into the bargain.  There he satbehind in the best of spirits, lustily whistling a tune, as if carryingthe tree were mere sport.  The Giant after dragging the heavy weightfor some time, could get on no farther, and shouted out:  "Hi!  I mustlet the tree fall."  The Tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the treewith both hands as if he had carried it the whole way, and said to theGiant:  "Fancy a big lazy fellow like you not being able to carry atree!"They continued to go on their way together, and as they passed by acherry-tree the Giant grasped the top of it, where the ripest fruithung, gave the branches into the Tailor's hand, and bade him eat.  Butthe little Tailor was far too weak to hold the tree down, and when theGiant let go the tree swung back into the air, bearing the littleTailor with it.  When he had fallen to the ground again without hurtinghimself, the Giant said:  "What!  do you mean to tell me you haven'tthe strength to hold down a feeble twig?"  "It wasn't strength that waswanting," replied time Tailor; "do you think that would have beenanything for a man who has killed seven at a blow?  I jumped over thetree because the huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us.  Doyou do the like if you dare."  The Giant made an attempt, but couldn'tget over the tree, and stuck fast in the branches, so that here, too,the little Tailor had the better of him."Well, you're a fine fellow, after all," said the Giant; "come andspend the night with us in our cave."  The little Tailor willinglyconsented to do this, and following his friend they went on till theyreached a cave where several other giants were sitting round a fire,each holding a roast sheep in his hand, of which he was eating.  Thelittle Tailor looked about him, and thought:  "Yes, there's certainlymore room to turn round in here than in my workshop."  The Giant showedhim a bed, and bade him lie down and have a good sleep.  But the bedwas too big for the little Tailor, so he didn't get into it, but creptaway into the corner.  At midnight, when the Giant thought the littleTailor was fast asleep, he rose up, and taking his big iron walking-stick, he broke the bed in two with a blow, and thought he had made anend of the little grasshopper.  At early dawn the Giants went off tothe wood, and quite forgot about the little Tailor, till all of asudden they met him trudging along in the most cheerful manner.  TheGiants were terrified at seeing him, and, fearing lest he should slaythem, they all took to their heels as fast as they could.The Little Tailor continued to follow his nose, and after he hadwandered about for a long time he came to the courtyard of a royalpalace, and feeling tired he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.While he lay there the people came, and looking him all over read onhis girdle, "Seven at a blow."  "Oh!" they said, "what can this greathero of a hundred fights want in our peaceful land?  He must indeed bea mighty man of valor."  They went and told the King about him, andsaid what a weighty and useful man he'd be in time of war and that itwould be well to secure him at any price.  This counsel pleased theKing, and he sent one of his courtiers down to the little Tailor, tooffer him, when he awoke, a commission in their army.  The messengerremained standing by the sleeper, and waited till he stretched hislimbs and opened his eyes, when he tendered his proposal.  "That's thevery thing I came here for," he answered; "I am quite ready to enterthe King's service."  So he was received with all honor, and given aspecial house of his own to live in.But the other officers were angry at the success of the little Tailor,and wished him a thousand miles away.  "What's to come of it all?" theyasked one another; "if we quarrel with him, he'll let out at us, and atevery blow seven will fall.  There'll soon be an end of us."  So theyresolved to go in a body to the King, and all to send in their papers."We are not made," they said.  "to hold out against a man who killsseven at a blow."  The King was grieved at the thought of losing allhis faithful servants for the sake of one man, and he wished heartilythat he had never set eyes on him, or that he could get rid of him.But he didn't dare to send him away, for he feared he might kill himand place himself on the throne.  He thought long and deeply over thematter, and finally came to a conclusion.  He sent for the Tailor andtold him that, seeing what a great and warlike hero he was, he wasabout to make him an offer.  In a certain wood of his kingdom theredwelt two Giants who did much harm by the way they robbed, murdered,burnt, and plundered everything about them; "no one could approach themwithout endangering his life.  If he could overcome and kill these twogiants he should have the King's only daughter for a wife, and half hiskingdom into the bargain; he might have a hundred horsemen, too, toback him up."  "That's the very thing for a man like me," thought thelittle Tailor; "one doesn't get the offer of a beautiful princess andhalf a kingdom every day."  "Done with you," he answered; "I'll soonput an end to the Giants.  But I haven't the smallest need of yourhundred horsemen; a fellow who can slay seven men at a blow need not beafraid of two."The little Tailor set out, and the hundred horsemen followed him.  Whenhe came to the outskirts of the wood he said to his followers:  "Youwait here, I'll manage the Giants by myself;" and he went on into thewood, casting his sharp little eyes right and left about him.  After awhile he spied the two Giants lying asleep under a tree, snoring tillthe very boughs bent with the breeze.  The little Tailor lost no timein filling his wallet with stones, and then climbed up the tree underwhich they lay.  When he got to about the middle of it he slipped alonga branch till he sat just above the sleepers, when he threw down onestone after the other on the nearest Giant.  The Giant felt nothing fora long time, but at last he woke up, and pinching his companion said:"What did you strike me for?"  "I didn't strike you," said the other;"you must be dreaming."  They both lay down to sleep again, and theTailor threw down a stone on the second Giant, who sprang up and cried:"What's that for?  Why did you throw something at me?"  "I didn't throwanything," growled the first one.  They wrangled on for a time, till asboth were tired, they made up the matter and fell asleep again.  Thelittle Tailor began his game once more, and flung the largest stone hecould find in his wallet with all his force, and hit the first Giant onthe chest.  "This is too much of a good thing!" he yelled, andspringing up like a madman, he knocked his companion against the treetill he trembled.  He gave, however, as good as he got, and they becameso enraged that they tore up trees and beat each other with them, tillthey both fell dead at once on the ground.  Then the little Tailorjumped down.  "It's a mercy," he said, "that they didn't root up thetree on which I was sitting, or I should have had to jump like asquirrel on to another, which, nimble though I am, would have been noeasy job."  He drew his sword and gave each of the Giants a very finethrust or two on the breast, and then went to the horsemen and said:"The deed is done; I've put an end to the two of them; but I assure youit has been no easy matter, for they even tore up trees in theirstruggle to defend themselves; but all that's of no use against one whoslays seven men at a blow."  "Weren't you wounded?" asked the horsemen."No fear," answered the Tailor; "they haven't touched a hair of myhead." But the horsemen wouldn't believe him till they rode into thewood and found the Giants weltering in their blood, and the trees lyingaround, torn up by the roots.The little Tailor now demanded the promised reward, but the Kingrepented his promise, and pondered once more how he could rid himselfof the hero.  "Before you obtain the hand of my daughter and half mykingdom," he said to him, "you must do another deed of valor.  Aunicorn is running about loose in the wood and doing much mischief; youmust first catch it."  "I'm even less afraid of one unicorn than of twoGiants; seven at a blow, that's my motto."  He took a piece of cord andan axe with him, went out to the wood, and again told the men who hadbeen sent with him to remain outside.  He hadn't to search long, forthe unicorn soon passed by, and, on perceiving the Tailor, dashedstraight at him as though it were going to spike him on the spot."Gently, gently," said he; "not so fast, my friend;" and standing stillhe waited till the beast was quite near, when he sprang lightly behinda tree; the unicorn ran with all its force against the tree, and rammedits horn so firmly into the trunk that it had no strength left to pullit out again, and was thus successfully captured.  "Now, I've caught mybird," said the Tailor, and he came out from behind the tree, placedthe cord round its neck first, then struck the horn out of the treewithin his axe, and when everything was in order led the beast Beforethe King.Still the King didn't want to give him the promised reward and made athird demand.  The Tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did agreat deal of harm in the wood; and he might have the huntsmen to helphim.  "Willingly," said the Tailor; "that's mere child's play."  But hedidn't take the huntsmen into the wood with him, and they were wellenough pleased to remain behind, for the wild boar had often receivedthem in a manner which did not make them desire its furtheracquaintance.  As soon as the boar perceived the Tailor it ran at himwith foaming mouth and gleaming teeth, and tried to knock him down; butour alert little friend ran into a chapel that stood near, and got outof the window with a jump.  The boar pursued him into the church, butthe Tailor skipped round to the door and closed it securely.  So theraging beast was caught, for it was far too heavy and unwieldy tospring out of the window.  The little Tailor summoned the huntsmentogether, that they might see the Prisoner with their own eyes.  Thenthe hero betook himself to the King, who was obliged now, whether heliked it or not, to keep his promise, and hand him over his daughterand half his kingdom.  Had he known that no hero-warrior, but only alittle tailor, stood before him, it would have gone even more to hisheart.  So the wedding was celebrated with much splendor and littlejoy, and the Tailor became a King.After a time the Queen heard her husband saying one night in his sleep:"My lad, make that waistcoat and patch these trousers, or I'll box yourears."  Thus she learned in what rank the young gentleman had beenborn, and next day she poured forth her woes to her father, and beggedhim to help her to get rid of a husband who was nothing more nor lessthan a tailor.  The King comforted her, and said:  "Leave your bedroomdoor open tonight; my servants shall stand outside, and when yourhusband is fast asleep they shall enter, bind him fast, and carry himon to a ship, which shall sail away out into the wide ocean."  TheQueen was well satisfied with the idea, but the armor-bearer, who hadoverheard everything, being much attached to his young master, wentstraight to him and revealed the whole plot.  "I'll soon put a stop tothe business," said the Tailor.  That night he and his wife went to bedat the usual time; and when she thought he had fallen asleep she gotup, opened the door, and then lay down again.  The little Tailor, whohad only pretended to be asleep, began to call out in a clear voice:"My lad, make that waistcoat and patch these trousers, or I'll box yourears.  I have killed seven at a blow, slain two giants, led a unicorncaptive, and caught a wild boar, then why should I be afraid of thosemen standing outside my door?"  The men, when they heard the Tailorsaying these words, were so terrified that they fled as if pursued by awild army, and didn't dare go near him again.  So the little Tailor wasand remained a King all the days of his life.THE SLEEPING BEAUTY IN THE WOODBy Charles PerraultTHERE was once in a distant country a King and Queen whose only sorrowwas that they had no children.  At last the Queen gave birth to alittle daughter and the King showed his joy by giving a christeningfeast so grand that the like of it was never known.  He asked all thefairies in the land-there were seven found in the kingdom-to standgodmothers to the little Princess; hoping that each might bestow on hersome good gift.After the christening all the guests returned to the palace, wherethere was placed before each fairy godmother a magnificent covereddish, and a knife, fork, and spoon of pure gold, set with preciousstones.  But, as they all were sitting down at table there entered anold fairy who had not been invited, because it was more than fiftyyears since she had gone out of a certain tower, and she was thought tobe dead or enchanted.  The King ordered a cover to be placed for her,but it was of common earthenware, for he had ordered from his jeweleronly seven gold dishes, for the seven fairies aforesaid.  The old fairythought herself neglected, and muttered angry threats, which wereoverheard by one of the younger fairies, who chanced to sit beside her.This good godmother, afraid of harm to the pretty baby, hastened tohide herself behind the hangings in the hall.  She did this because shewished to speak last and repair any evil the old fairy might intend.The fairies now offered their good wishes, which, unlike most wishes,were sure to come true.  The first wished that the little Princessshould grow up the fairest woman in the world; the second, that sheshould have wit like an angel; the third, that she should be perfectlygraceful; the fourth, that she should sing like a nightingale; thefifth, that she should dance perfectly well; the sixth, that she shouldplay all kinds of music perfectly.  Then the old fairy's turn came.Shaking her head spitefully, she uttered the wish that when the babygrew up into a young lady, and learned to spin, she might prick herfinger with a spindle and die of the wound.This terrible prophecy made all the company tremble; and every one fellto crying.  Upon which the wise young fairy appeared from behind thecurtains and said: "Assure yourselves O King and Queen; the Princessshall not die.  I have no power to undo what my elder has done.  ThePrincess must pierce her finger with a spindle and she shall then sink,not into the sleep of death, but into a sleep that will last a hundredyears.  After that time is ended, the son of a King shall come andawake her."Then all the fairies vanished.The King, in the hope of avoiding his daughter's doom, issued an edictforbidding all persons to spin, and even to have spinning wheels intheir houses, on pain of instant death.  But it was in vain.  One daywhen she was just fifteen years of age, the King and Queen left theirdaughter alone in one of their castles, where, wandering about at herwill, she came to a little room in the top of a tower, and there founda very old woman, who had not heard of the King's edict, busy with herspinning wheel."What are you doing, good old woman?" said the Princess."I'm spinning my pretty child.""Ah, how pretty!  Let me try if I can spin also."She had no sooner taken up the spindle than, being hasty and unhandy,she pierced her finger with the point.  Though it was so small a wound,she fainted away at once and dropped on the floor.  The poor old womancalled for help; shortly came the ladies-in-waiting, who tried everymeans to restore their young mistress; but all in vain.  She lay,beautiful as an angel, the color still lingering in her lips andcheeks, her fair bosom softly stirred with her breath; only her eyeswere fast closed.  When the King, her father, and the Queen, hermother, beheld her thus, they knew that all had happened as the cruelfairy meant, and that their daughter would sleep for one hundred years.They sent away all the physicians and attendants, and themselvessorrowing laid her upon a bed in the finest apartment in the palace.There she slept and looked like a sleeping angel still.When this misfortune happened, the kindly young fairy who had saved thePrincess by changing her sleep of death into this sleep of a hundredyears, was twelve thousand leagues away, in the kingdom of Mataquin.But, being informed of everything by a little dwarf who wore seven-league boots, she arrived speedily in a chariot of fire drawn bydragons.  The King handed her out of the chariot, and she approved ofall he had done.  Then, being a fairy of great common sense andforesight, she thought that the Princess, awakening after a hundredyears in this old castle, might not know what to do with herself if shefound herself alone.  Accordingly, she touched with her magic wandeverybody and everything in the palace except the King and Queen:governesses, ladies of honor, waiting maids, gentlemen ushers, cooks,kitchen girls, pages, footmen; even the horses that were in thestables, and the grooms that attended them, she touched each and all.Nay, the dogs, too, in the outer court, and the little fat lapdog,Mopsey, who had laid himself down beside his mistress on her splendidbed, were also touched, and they, like all the rest, fell fast asleepin a moment.  The very spits that were before the kitchen fire fellasleep, and the fire itself, and everything became as still as if itwere the middle of the night, or as if the palace were a palace of thedead.The King and Queen, having kissed their daughter, went out of thecastle, giving orders that it was to be approached no more.  Thecommand was unnecessary, for in one quarter of an hour there sprang uparound it a wood so thick and thorny that neither beasts nor men couldattempt to penetrate there.  Above this dense mass of forest could onlybe seen the top of the high tower where the lovely Princess slept.When a hundred years were gone the King had died, and his throne hadpassed to another royal family.  The reigning King's son, being one dayout hunting, was stopped in the chase by this great wood, inquired whatwood it was and what were those towers which he saw appearing out ofthe midst of it.  Every one answered as he had heard.  Some said it wasan old castle haunted by spirits.  Others said it was the abode ofwitches and enchanters.  The most common story was that an Ogre livedthere, a giant with long teeth and claws, who carried away naughtylittle boys and girls and ate them up.  The Prince did not know what tothink.  At length an old peasant was found who remembered having heardhis grandfather say to his father that in this tower was a Princess,beautiful as the day, who was doomed to sleep there for one hundredyears, until awakened by a king's son, who was to marry her.At this the young Prince, who had the spirit of a hero, determined tofind out the truth for himself.Spurred on by love and honor, he leaped from his horse and began toforce his way through the thick wood.  To his amazement the stiffbranches all gave way, and the ugly thorns drew back of their ownaccord, and the brambles buried themselves in the earth to let himpass.  This done, they closed behind him, allowing none to follow.Nevertheless, he pushed boldly on alone.The first thing he saw was enough to freeze him with fear.  Bodies ofmen and horses lay extended on the ground; but the men had faces, notdeath white, but red as roses, and beside them were glasses half filledwith wine, showing that they had gone to sleep drinking.  Next heentered a large court paved with marble, where stood rows of guardspresenting arms, but as still as if cut out of stone; then he passedthrough many chambers where gentlemen and ladies, all in the dress ofthe past century, slept at their ease, some standing, some sitting.The pages were lurking in corners, the ladies of honor were stoopingover their embroidery frames or listening to the gentlemen of thecourt; but all were as silent and as quiet as statues.  Their clothes,strange to say, were fresh and new as ever; and not a particle of dustor spider web had gathered over the furniture, though it had not knowna broom for a hundred years.  Finally, the astonished Prince came to aninner chamber, where was the fairest sight his eyes ever beheld.A young girl of wonderful beauty lay asleep on an embroidered bed, andshe looked as if she had only just closed her eyes.  Trembling, thePrince approached and knelt beside her.  Some say he kissed her; but asnobody saw it, and she never told, we cannot be quite sure of the fact.However, as the end of the enchantment had come, the Princess waked atonce, and, looking at him with eyes of the tenderest regard, said,sleepily: "Is it you, my Prince?  I have waited for you very long."Charmed with these words, and still more by the tone in which they wereuttered, the Prince assured her that he loved her more than his life.For a long time did they sit talking, and yet had not said half enough.Their only interruption was the little dog Mopsey, who had awakenedwith his mistress, and now began to be jealous that the Princess didnot notice him as much as she was wont to do.Meanwhile all the attendants, whose enchantment was also broken, notbeing in love, were ready to die of hunger after their fast of ahundred years.  A lady of honor ventured to say that dinner was served,whereupon the Prince handed his beloved Princess at once to the greathall.  She did not wait to dress for dinner, being already perfectlyand magnificently attired, though in a fashion somewhat out of date.However, her lover had the politeness not to notice this, nor to remindher that she was dressed exactly like his grandmother whose portraitstill hung on the palace walls.During dinner a concert by the attendant musicians took place, and,considering they had not touched their instruments for a century, theyplayed the old tunes extremely well.  They ended with a wedding march,for that very evening the Prince and Princess were married.After a few days they went together out of the castle and enchantedwood, both of which immediately vanished, and were nevermore beheld bymortal eyes.  The Princess was restored to her ancestral kingdom, andafter a few years the Prince and she became King and Queen, and ruledlong and happily.THE FAIR ONE WITH GOLDEN LOCKSRetold by Miss MulockTHERE was once a King's daughter so beautiful that they named her theFair One with Golden Locks.  These golden locks were the mostremarkable in the world, soft and fine, and falling in long waves downto her very feet.  She wore them always thus, loose and flowing,surmounted with a wreath of flowers; and though such long hair wassometimes rather inconvenient, it was so exceedingly beautiful, shiningin the sun like ripples of molten gold, that everybody agreed she fullydeserved her name.Now there was a young King of a neighboring country, very handsome,very rich, and wanting nothing but a wife to make him happy.  He heardso much of the various perfections of the Fair One with Golden Locks,that at last, without even seeing her, he fell in love with her sodesperately that he could neither eat nor drink, and resolved to sendan ambassador at once to demand her in marriage.  So he ordered amagnificent equipage-more than a hundred horses and a hundred footmen-in order to bring back to him the Fair One with Golden Locks, who, henever doubted, would be only too happy to become his Queen.  Indeed, hefelt so sure of her that he refurnished the whole palace, and had madeby all the dressmakers of the city, dresses enough to last a lady alifetime.  But, alas! when the ambassador arrived and delivered hismessage, either the princess was in bad humor, or the offer did notappear to be to her taste; for she returned her best thanks to hismajesty, but said she had not the slightest wish or intention to getmarried.  She also, being a prudent damsel, declined receiving any ofthe presents which the King had sent her; except that, not quite tooffend his majesty, she retained a box of English pins, which were inthat country of considerable value.When the ambassador returned, alone and unsuccessful, all the court wasvery much affected, and the King himself began to weep with all hismight.  Now, there was in the palace household a young gentleman namedAvenant, beautiful as the sun, besides being at once so amiable and sowise that the King confided to him all his affairs; and every one lovedhim, except those people-to be found in all courts-who were envious ofhis good fortune.  These malicious folk hearing him say gaily: "If theKing had sent me to fetch the Fair One with Golden Locks, I know shewould have come back with me," repeated the saying in such a manner,that it appeared as if Avenant thought so much of himself and hisbeauty, and felt sure the princess would have followed him all over theworld; which when it came to the ears of the King, as it was meant todo, irritated him so much that he commanded Avenant to be imprisoned ina high tower and left to die there of hunger.  The guards accordinglycarried off the young man, who had quite forgotten his idle speech, andhad not the least idea what fault he had committed.  They ill-treatedhim very much, and then left him with nothing to eat and only water todrink.  This, however, kept him alive for a few days, during which hedid not cease to complain aloud, and to call upon the King, saying: "OhKing, what harm have I done?  You have no subject more faithful than I.Never have I had a thought which could offend you."And it so befell that the King, coming by chance, or else with a sortof remorse, past the tower, was touched by the voice of the youngAvenant, whom he had once so much regarded.  In spite of all thecourtiers could do to prevent him, he stopped to listen, and overheardthese words.  The tears rushed into his eyes; he opened the door of thetower, and called: "Avenant!"  Avenant came, creeping feebly along,fell at the King's knees, and kissed his feet:"Oh sire, what have I done that you should treat me so cruelly?""You have mocked me and my ambassador; for you said, if I had sent youto fetch the Fair One with Golden Locks, you would have been successfuland brought her back.""I did say it, and it was true," replied Avenant fearlessly; "for Ishould have told her so much about your majesty and your various highqualities, which no one knows so well as myself, that I am persuadedshe would have returned with me.""I believe it," said the King, with an angry look at those who hadspoken ill of his favorite; he then gave Avenant a free pardon and tookhim back with him to the court.After having supplied the famished youth with as much supper as hecould eat, the King admitted him to a private audience, and said: "I amas much in love as ever with the Fair One with Golden Locks, so I willtake thee at thy word, and send thee to try and win her for me.""Very well, please your majesty" replied Avenant cheerfully; "I willdepart to-morrow."The King, overjoyed with his willingness and hopefulness would havefurnished him with a still more magnificent equipage and suite than thefirst ambassador but Avenant refused to take anything except a goodhorse to ride, and letters of introduction to the Princess's father.The King embraced him and eagerly saw him depart.It was on a Monday morning when, without any pomp or show, Avenant thusstarted on his mission.  He rode slowly and meditatively, ponderingover every possible means of persuading the Fair One with Golden Locksto marry the King; but, even after several days journey towards hercountry, no clear project had entered into his mind.  One morning, whenhe had started at break of day, he came to a great meadow with a streamrunning through it, along which were planted willows and poplars.  Itwas such a pleasant, rippling stream that he dismounted and sat down onits banks.  There he perceived gasping on the grass a large goldenCarp, which, in leaping too far after gnats, had thrown itself quiteout of the water, and now lay dying on the greensward.  Avenant tookpity on it, and though he was very hungry, and the fish was very fat,and he would well enough have liked it for his breakfast, still helifted it gently and put it back into the stream.  No sooner had theCarp touched the fresh cool water than it revived and swam away; butshortly returning, it spoke to him from the water in this wise:"Avenant, I thank you for your good deed.  I was dying, and you havesaved me; I will recompense you for this one day."After this pretty little speech, the fish popped down to the bottom ofthe stream, according to the habit of Carp, leaving Avenant very muchastonished, as was natural.Another day he met with a Raven that was in great distress, beingpursued by an Eagle, which would have swallowed him up in no time."See," thought Avenant, "how the stronger oppress the weaker!  Whatright has an Eagle to eat up a Raven?"  So taking his bow and arrow,which he always carried, he shot the Eagle dead, and the Raven,delighted, perched in safety on an opposite tree."Avenant," screeched he, though not in the sweetest voice in the world,"you have generously succored me, a poor miserable Raven.  I am notungrateful, and I will recompense you one day.""Thank you," said Avenant, and continued his road.Entering in a thick wood, so dark with the shadows of early morningthat he could scarcely find his way, he heard an Owl hooting, like anowl in great tribulation.  She had been caught by the nets spread bybird-catchers to entrap finches, larks, and other small birds.  "What apity," thought Avenant, "that men must always torment poor birds andbeasts who have done them no harm!"  So he took out his knife, cut thenet, and let the Owl go free.  She went sailing up in the air, butimmediately returned hovering over his head on her brown wings."Avenant," said she, "at daylight the bird-catchers would have beenhere, and I should have been caught and killed.  I have a gratefulheart; I will recompense you one day."These were the three principal adventures that befell Avenant on hisway to the kingdom of the Fair One with Golden Locks.  Arrived there,he dressed himself with the greatest care, in a habit of silverbrocade, and a hat adorned with plumes of scarlet and white.  He threwover all a rich mantle, and carried a little basket, in which was alovely little dog, an offering of respect to the Princess.  With thishe presented himself at the palace gates, where even though he camealone, his mien was so dignified and graceful, so altogether charming,that every one did him reverence, and was eager to run and tell theFair One with Golden Locks, that Avenant, another ambassador from theKing, her suitor, awaited an audience."Avenant!" repeated the Princess.  "That is a pretty name; perhaps theyouth is pretty too.""So beautiful," said the ladies of honor, "that while he stood underthe palace window we could do nothing but look at him.""How silly of you!" sharply said the Princess.  But she desired them tobring her robe of blue satin, to comb out her long hair, and adorn itwith the freshest garland of flowers; to give her her high-heeledshoes, and her fan.  "Also," added she, "take care that my audience-chamber is well swept and my throne well dusted.  I wish in everythingto appear as becomes the Fair One with Golden Locks."This done she seated herself on her throne of ivory and ebony and gaveorders for her musicians to play, but softly, so as not to disturbconversation.  Thus, shining in all her beauty, she admitted Avenant toher presence.He was so dazzled that at first he could not speak; then he began anddelivered his harangue to perfection."Gentle Avenant," returned the Princess, after listening to all hisreasons for her returning with him, "your arguments are very strong,and I am inclined to listen to them; but you must first find for me aring, which I dropped into the river about a month ago.  Until Irecover it, I can listen to no proposition of marriage."Avenant, surprised and disturbed, made her a profound reverence andretired, taking with him the basket and the little dog Cabriole, whichshe refused to accept.  All night long he sat sighing to himself.  "Howcan I ever find a ring which she dropped into the river a month ago?She has set me an impossibility.""My dear master," said Cabriole, "nothing is an impossibility to one soyoung and charming as you are; let us go at daybreak to the river-side."Avenant patted him, but replied nothing; until, worn out with grief, heslept.  Before dawn Cabriole wakened him, saying: "Master, dressyourself and let us go to the river."There Avenant walked up and down, with his arms folded and his headbent, but saw nothing.  At last he heard a voice, calling from adistance, "Avenant, Avenant!"The little dog ran to the water-side.- "Never believe me again, master,if it is not a golden Carp with a ring in its mouth!""Yes, Avenant," said the Carp, "this is the ring which the Princess haslost.  You saved my life in the willow meadow, and I have recompensedyou.  Farewell!"Avenant took the ring gratefully and returned to the palace withCabriole, who scampered about in great glee.Craving an audience, he presented the Princess with her ring, andbegged her to accompany him to his master's kingdom.  She took thering, looked at it, and thought she was surely dreaming."Some fairy must have assisted you, fortunate Avenant," said she."Madam, I am only fortunate in my desire to obey your wishes.""Obey me still," she said graciously.  "There is a prince namedGalifron, whose suit I have refused.  He is a giant as tall as a tower,who eats a man as a monkey eats a nut: he puts cannons into his pocketsinstead of pistols; and when he speaks, his voice is so loud that everyone near him becomes deaf.  Go and fight him, and bring me his head."Avenant was thunderstruck; but after a time he recovered himself."Very well, madam, I shall certainly perish, but I will perish like abrave man.  I will depart at once to fight the Giant Galifron."The Princess, now in her turn surprised and alarmed, tried everypersuasion to induce him not to go, but in vain.  Avenant armed himselfand started, carrying his little dog in its basket.  Cabriole was theonly creature that gave him consolation: "Courage, master!  While youattack the giant, I will bite his legs: he will stoop down to strikeme, and then you can knock him on the head."  Avenant smiled at thelittle dog's spirit, but he knew it was useless.Arrived at the castle of Galifron, he found the road all strewn withbones, and carcasses of men.  Soon he saw the giant walking.  His headwas level with the highest trees, and he sang in a terrific voice:"Bring me babies to devour;More-more-more-more-Men and women, tender and tough;All the world holds not enough."To which Avenant replied, imitating the tune:"Avenant you here may see,He is come to punish thee:Be he tender, be he tough,To kill thee, giant, he is enough."Hearing these words, the giant took up his massive club, looked aroundfor the singer, and perceiving him, would have slain him on the spot,had not a Raven, sitting on a tree close by, suddenly flown out uponhim and picked out both his eyes.  Then Avenant easily killed him andcut off his head, while the Raven, watching him, said:"You shot the Eagle who was pursuing me: I promised to recompense you,and to-day I have done it.  We are quits.""No, it is I who am your debtor, Sir Raven," replied Avenant, as,hanging the frightful head to his saddle-bow, he mounted his horse androde back to the city of the Fair One with Golden Locks.There everybody followed him, shouting: "Here is brave Avenant, who haskilled the giant," until the Princess, hearing the noise, and fearingit was Avenant himself who was killed, appeared, all trembling; andeven when he appeared with Galifron's head, she trembled still,although she had nothing to fear."Madam," said Avenant, "your enemy is dead; so I trust you will acceptthe hand of the King my master.""I cannot," replied she thoughtfully, "unless you first bring me aphial of the water in the Grotto of Darkness.  It is six leagues inlength, and guarded at the entrance by two fiery dragons.  Within, itis a pit, full of scorpions, lizards, and serpents, and at the bottomof this place flows the Fountain of Beauty and Health.  All who wash init become, if ugly, beautiful, and if beautiful, beautiful forever; ifold, young; and if young, young forever.  Judge then, Avenant, if I canquit my kingdom without carrying with me some of this miraculouswater.""Madam," replied Avenant, "you are already so beautiful that yourequire it not; but I am an unfortunate ambassador whose death youdesire; I will obey you, though I know I shall never return."So he departed with his only friends-his horse and his faithful dogCabriole; while all who met him looked at him compassionately, pityingso pretty a youth bound on such a hopeless errand.  But, however kindlythey addressed him, Avenant rode on and answered nothing, for he wastoo sad at heart.He reached a mountain-side, where he sat down to rest, leaving hishorse to graze, and Cabriole to run after the flies.  He knew that theGrotto of Darkness was not far off, yet he looked about him like onewho sees nothing.  At last he perceived a rock, as black as ink, whencecame a thick smoke; and in a moment appeared one of the two dragons,breathing out flames.  It had a yellow and green body, claws, and along tail.  When Cabriole saw the monster, the poor little dog hidhimself in terrible fright.  But Avenant resolved to die bravely; sotaking a phial which the Princess had given him, he prepared to descendinto the cave."Cabriole," said he, "I shall soon be dead; then fill this phial withmy blood, and carry it to the Fair One with Golden Locks, and afterwardto the King, my master, to show him I have been faithful to the last."While he was thus speaking a voice called: "Avenant, Avenant!"-and hesaw an Owl sitting on a hollow tree.  Said the Owl: "You cut the net inwhich I was caught, and I vow to recompense you.  Now is the time.Give me the phial; I know every corner of the Grotto of Darkness-I willfetch you the water of beauty."Delighted beyond words, Avenant delivered up his phial; the Owl flewwith it into the grotto, and in less than half an hour reappeared,bringing it quite full and well corked.  Avenant thanked her with allhis heart, and joyfully took once more the road to the city.The Fair One with Golden Locks had no more to say.  She consented toaccompany him back, with all her suite, to his master's court.  On theway thither she saw so much of him, and found him so charming, thatAvenant might have married her himself had he chosen; but he would nothave been false to his master for all the beauties under the sun.  Atlength they arrived at the King's city, and the Fair One with GoldenLocks became his spouse and Queen.  But she still loved Avenant in herheart, and often said to the King her lord: "But for Avenant I shouldnot be here; he has done all sorts of impossible deeds for my sake; hehas fetched me the water of beauty, and I shall never grow old-inshort, I owe him everything."And she praised him in this sort so much that at length the King becamejealous; and though Ayenant gave him not the slightest cause ofoffense, he shut him up in the same high tower once more-but with ironson his hands and feet, and a cruel jailer besides, who fed him withbread and water only.  His sole companion was his little dog Cabriole.When the Fair One with Golden Locks heard of this, she reproached herhusband for his ingratitude, and then throwing herself at his knees,implored that Avenant might be set free.  But the King only said: "Sheloves him!" and refused her prayer.  The Queen entreated no more, butfell into a deep melancholy.When the King saw it, he thought she did not care for him because hewas not handsome enough; and that if he could wash his face with herwater of beauty, it would make her love him the more.  He knew that shekept it in a cabinet in her chamber, where she could find it always.Now it happened that a waiting-maid, in cleaning out this cabinet, had,the very day before, knocked down the phial, which was broken in athousand pieces, and all the contents were lost.  Very much alarmed,she then remembered seeing, in a cabinet belonging to the King, asimilar phial.  This she fetched, and put in the place of the otherone, in which was the water of beauty.  But the King's phial containedthe water of death.  It was a poison, used to destroy great criminals-that is, noblemen, gentlemen, and such like.  Instead of hanging themor cutting their heads off, like common people, they were compelled towash their faces with this water; upon which they fell asleep, and wokeno more.  So it happened that the King, taking up this phial, believingit to be the water of beauty, washed his face with it, fell asleep,and-died.Cabriole heard the news, and, gliding in and out among the crowd whichclustered round the young and lovely widow, whispered softly to her-"Madam, do not forget poor Avenant."  If she had been disposed to doso, the sight of his little dog would have been enough to remind her ofhim-his many sufferings, and his great fidelity.  She rose up, withoutspeaking to anybody, and went straight to the tower where Avenant wasconfined.  There, with her own hands, she struck off his chains, andputting a crown of gold on his head, and a purple mantle on hisshoulders, said to him, "Be King- and my husband.Avenant could not refuse: for in his heart he had loved her all thetime.  He threw himself at her feet, and then took the crown andscepter, and ruled her kingdom like a king.  All the people weredelighted to have him as their sovereign.  The marriage was celebratedin all imaginable pomp, and Avenant and the Fair One with Golden Lockslived and reigned happily together all their days.BEAUTY AND THE BEASTBy Mme. d'AulnoyTHERE was once a very rich merchant, who had six children, three boysand three girls.  As he was himself a man of great sense, he spared noexpense for their education.  The three daughters were all handsome,but particularly the youngest; indeed, she was so very beautiful, thatin her childhood everyone called her the Little Beauty; and beingequally lovely when she was grown up, nobody called her by any othername, which made her sisters very jealous of her.  This youngestdaughter was not only more handsome than her sisters, but also wasbetter tempered.  The two eldest were vain of their wealth andposition.  They gave themselves a thousand airs, and refused to visitother merchants' daughters; nor would they condescend to be seen exceptwith persons of quality.They went every day to balls, p1ays, and public walks, and always madegame of their youngest sister for spending her time in reading or otheruseful employments.  As it was well known that these young ladies wouldhave large fortunes, many great merchants wished to get them for wives;but the two eldest always answered, that, for their parts, they had nothoughts of marrying anyone below a duke or an earl at least.  Beautyhad quite as many offers as her sisters, but she always answered, withthe greatest civility, that though she was much obliged to her lovers,she would rather live some years longer with her father, as she thoughtherself too young to marry.It happened that, by some unlucky accident, the merchant suddenly lostall his fortune, and had nothing left but a small cottage in thecountry.  Upon this he said to his daughters, while the tears ran downhis cheeks, "My children, we must now go and dwell in the cottage, andtry to get a living by labor, for we have no other means of support."The two eldest replied that they did not know how to work, and wouldnot leave town; for they had lovers enough who would be glad to marrythem, though they had no longer any fortune.  But in this they weremistaken; for when the lovers heard what had happened, they said, "Thegirls were so proud and ill-tempered, that all we wanted was theirfortune; we are not sorry at all to see their pride brought down; letthem show off their airs to their cows and sheep."  But everybodypitied poor Beauty, because she was so sweet-tempered and kind to all,and several gentlemen offered to marry her, though she had not a penny;but Beauty still refused, and said she could not think of leaving herpoor father in this trouble.  At first Beauty could not help sometimescrying in secret for the hardships she was now obliged to suffer; butin a very short time she said to herself, "All the crying in the worldwill do me no good, so I will try to be happy without a fortune."When they had removed to their cottage, the merchant and his three sonsemployed themselves in ploughing and sowing the fields, and working inthe garden.  Beauty also did her part, for she rose by four o'clockevery morning, lighted the fires, cleaned the house, and got ready thebreakfast for the whole family.  At first she found all this very hard;but she soon grew quite used to it, and thought it no hardship; indeed,the work greatly benefited her health.  When she had done, she used toamuse herself with reading, playing her music, or singing while shespun.  But her two sisters were at a loss what to do to pass the timeaway; they had their breakfast in bed, and did not rise till teno'clock.  Then they commonly walked out, but always found themselvesvery soon tired; when they would often sit down under a shady tree, andgrieve for the loss of their carriage and fine clothes, and say to eachother, "What a mean-spirited, poor stupid creature our young sister is,to be so content within this low way of life!"  But their fatherthought differently; and loved and admired his youngest child more thanever.After they had lived in this manner about a year the merchant receiveda letter, which informed him that one of his richest ships, which hethought was lost, had just come unto port.  This news made the twoeldest sisters almost mad with joy; for they thought they should nowleave the cottage, and have all their finery again.  When they foundthat their father must take a journey to the ship, the two eldestbegged he would not fail to bring them back some new gowns, caps,rings, and all sorts of trinkets.  But Beauty asked for nothing; forshe thought in herself that all the Ship was worth would hardly buyeverything her sisters wished for.  "Beauty," said the merchant, "howcomes it that you ask for nothing: what can I bring you, my child?""Since you are so kind as to think of me, dear father," she answered,"I should be glad if you would bring me a rose, for we have none in ourgarden."  Now Beauty did not indeed wish for a rose, nor anything else,but she only said this that she might not affront her sisters;otherwise they would have said she wanted her father to praise her fordesiring nothing.  The merchant took his leave of them, and set out onhis journey; but when he got to the ship, some persons went to law withhim about the cargo, and after a deal of trouble he came back to hiscottage as poor as he had left it.  When he was within thirty miles ofhis home, and thinking of the joy of again meeting his children, helost his way in the midst of a dense forest.  It rained and snowed veryhard, and, besides, the wind was so high as to throw him twice from hishorse.  Night came on, and he feared he should die of cold and hunger,or be torn to pieces by the wolves that he heard howling round him.All at once, he cast his eyes toward a long avenue, and saw at the enda light, but it seemed a great way off.  He made the best of his waytoward it, and found that it came from a splendid palace, the windowsof which were all blazing with light.  It had great bronze gates,standing wide open, and fine court-yards, through which the merchantpassed; but not a living soul was to be seen.  There were stables, too,which his poor, starved horse, less scrupulous than himself, entered atonce, and took a good meal of oats and hay.  His master then tied himup, and walked toward the entrance hall, but still without seeing asingle creature.  He went on to a large dining parlor, where he found agood fire, and table covered with some very nice dishes, but only oneplate with a knife and fork.  As the snow and rain had wetted him tothe skin, he went up to the fire to dry himself.  "I hope," said he,"the master of the house or his servants will excuse me, for it surelywill not be long now before I see them."  He waited some time, butstill nobody came: at last the clock struck eleven, and the merchant,being quite faint for the want of food, helped himself to a chicken,and to a few glasses of wine, yet all the time trembling with fear.  Hesat till the clock struck twelve, and then, taking courage, began tothink he might as well look about him: so he opened a door at the endof the hall, and went through it into a very grand room, in which therewas a fine bed; and as he was feeling very weary, he shut the door,took off his clothes, and got into it.It was ten o'clock in the morning before he awoke, when he was amazedto see a handsome new suit of clothes laid ready for him, instead ofhis own, which were all torn and spoiled.  "To be sure," said he tohimself, "this place belongs to some good fairy, who has taken pity onmy ill luck."  He looked out of the window, and instead of the snow-covered wood, where he had lost himself the previous night, he saw themost charming arbors covered with all kinds of flowers.  Returning tothe hall where he had supper, he found a breakfast table, readyprepared.  "Indeed, my good fairy," said the merchant aloud, "I amvastly obliged to you for your kind care of me."  He then made a heartybreakfast, took his hat, and was going to the stable to pay his horse avisit; but as he passed under one of the arbors, which was loaded withroses, he thought of what Beauty had asked him to bring back to her,and so he took a bunch of roses to carry home.  At the same moment heheard a loud noise, and saw coming toward him a beast, so frightful tolook at that he was ready to faint with fear.  "Ungrateful man!" saidthe beast in a terrible voice, "I have saved your life by admitting youinto my palace, and in return you steal my roses, which I value morethan anything I possess.  But you shall atone for your fault-die in aquarter of an hour.The merchant fell on his knees, and clasping his hands, said, "Sir, Ihumbly beg your pardon: I did not think it would offend you to gather arose for one of my daughters, who had entreated me to bring her onehome.  Do not kill me, my lord!""I am not a lord, but a beast," replied.  the monster, "I hate falsecompliments: so do not fancy that you can coax me by any such ways.You tell me that you have daughters; now I will suffer you to escape,if one of them will come and die in your stead.  If not, profuse thatyou will yourself return in three months, to be dealt with as I maychoose."The tender-hearted merchant had no thoughts of letting any one of hisdaughters die for his sake; but he knew that if he seemed to accept thebeast's terms, he should at least have the pleasure of seeing them onceagain.  So he gave his promise, and was told that he might then set offas soon as he liked.  "But," said the beast, "I do not wish you to goback empty handed.  Go to the room you slept in, and you will find achest there; fill it with whatsoever you like best, and I will have ittaken to your own house for you."When the beast had said this, he went away.  The good merchant, left tohimself, began to consider that as he must die-for he had no thought ofbreaking a promise, made even to a beast-he might as well have thecomfort of leaving his children provided for.  He returned to the roomhe had slept in, and found there heaps of gold pieces lying about.He filled the chest with them to the very brim, locked it, and,mounting his horse, left the palace as sorrowful as he had been gladwhen he first beheld it.  The horse took a path across the forest ofhis own accord, and in a few hours they reached the merchant's house.His children came running round him, but, instead of kissing them withjoy, he could not help weeping as he looked at them.  He held in hishand the bunch of roses, which he gave to Beauty, saying, "Take theseroses, Beauty; but little do you think how dear they have cost yourpoor father;" and then he gave them an account of all that he had seenor heard in the palace of the beast.The two eldest sisters now began to shed tears, and to lay the blameupon Beauty, who, they said, would be the cause of her father's death."See," said they, "what happens from the pride of the little wretch;why did not she ask for such things as we did?  But, to be sure, Missmust not be like other people; and though she will be the cause of herfather's death, yet she does not shed a tear.""It would be useless," replied Beauty, "for my father shall not die.As the beast will accept one of his daughters, I will give myself up,and be only too happy to prove my love for the best of fathers.""No, sister," said the three brothers with one voice, "that cannot be;we will go in search of this monster, and either he or we will perish.""Do not hope to kill him," said the merchant, "his power is far toogreat.  But Beauty's young life shall not be sacrificed; I am old, andcannot expect to live much longer; so I shall but give up a few yearsof my life, and shall only grieve for the sake of my children.""Never, father!" cried Beauty; "if you go back to the palace, youcannot hinder my going after you; though young, I am not over-fond oflife; and I would much rather be eaten up by the monster, than die ofgrief for your loss."The merchant in vain tried to reason with Beauty who still obstinatelykept to her purpose; which, in truth, made her two sisters glad, forthey were jealous of her, because everybody loved her.The merchant was so grieved at the thoughts of losing his child, thathe never once thought of the chest filled with gold, but at night, tohis great surprise, he found it standing by his bedside.  He saidnothing about his riches to his eldest daughters, for he knew very wellit would at once make them want to return to town; but he told Beautyhis secret, and she then said, that while he was away, two gentlemenhad been on a visit at her cottage, who had fallen in love with her twosisters.  She entreated her father to marry them without delay, for shewas so sweet-natured, she only wished them to be happy.Three months went by, only too fast, and then the merchant and Beautygot ready to set out for the palace of the beast.  Upon this, the twosisters rubbed their eyes with an onion, to make believe they werecrying; both the merchant and his sons cried in earnest.  Only Beautyshed no tears.  They reached the palace in a very few hours, and thehorse, without bidding, went into the stable as before.  The merchantand Beauty walked toward the large hall, where they found a tablecovered with every dainty and two plates laid already.  The merchanthad very little appetite; but Beauty, that she might the better hideher grief, placed herself at the table, and helped her father; she thenbegan to eat herself, and thought all the time that, to be sure, thebeast had a mind to fatten her before he ate her up, since he hadprovided such good cheer for her.  When they had done their supper,they heard a great noise, and the good old man began to bid his poorchild farewell, for he knew it was the beast coming to them.  WhenBeauty first saw that frightful form, she was very much terrified, buttried to hide her fear.  The creature walked up to her, and eyed herall over-then asked her in a dreadful voice if she had come quite ofher own accord."Yes," said Beauty."Then you are a good girl, and I am very much obliged to you."This was such an astonishingly civil answer that Beauty's courage rose:but it sank again when the beast, addressing the merchant, desired himto leave the palace next morning, and never return to it again.  "Andso good-night, merchant.  And good-night, Beauty.""Good-night, beast," she answered, as the monster shuffled out of theroom."Ah!  my dear child," said the merchant, kissing his daughter, "I amhalf dead already, at the thought of leaving you with this dreadfulbeast; you shall go back and let me stay in your place.""No," said Beauty, boldly, "I will never agree to that; you must gohome to-morrow morning."They then wished each other good-night, and went to bed, both of themthinking they should not be able to close their eyes; but as soon asever they had lain down, they fell into a deep sleep, and did not awaketill morning.  Beauty dreamed that a lady came up to her, who said, "Iam very much pleased, Beauty, with the goodness you have shown, inbeing willing to give your life to save that of your father.  Do not beafraid of anything; you shall not go without a reward."As soon as Beauty awoke she told her father this dream; but though itgave him some comfort, he was a long time before he could be persuadedto leave the palace.  At last Beauty succeeded in getting him safelyaway.When her father was out of sight, poor Beauty began to weep sorely;still, having naturally a courageous spirit, she soon resolved not tomake her sad case still worse by sorrow, which she knew was vain, butto wait and be patient.  She walked about to take a view of all thepalace, and the elegance of every part of it much charmed her.But what was her surprise, when she came to a door on which waswritten, BEAUTY'S ROOM!  She opened it in haste, and her eyes weredazzled by the splendor and taste of the apartment.  What made herwonder more than all the rest, was a large library filled with books, aharpsichord, and many pieces of music.  "The beast surely does not meanto eat me up immediately," said she, "since he takes care I shall notbe at a loss how to amuse myself."  She opened the library and sawthese verses written in letters of gold in the back of one of the books"Beauteous lady, dry your tears,Here's no cause for sighs or fears.Command as freely as you may,For you command and I obey.""Alas!" said she, sighing; "I wish I could only command a sight of mypoor father, and to know what he is doing at this moment."  Just then,by chance, she cast her eyes upon a looking-glass that stood near her,and in it she saw a picture of her old home, and her father ridingmournfully up to the door.  Her sisters came out to meet him, andalthough they tried to look sorry, it was easy to see that in theirhearts they were very glad.  In a short time all this picturedisappeared, but it caused Beauty to think that the beast, besidesbeing very powerful, was also very kind.  About the middle of the dayshe found a table laid ready for her, and a sweet concert of musicplayed all the time she was dining, without her seeing anybody.  But atsupper, when she was going to seat herself at table, she heard thenoise of the beast, and could not help trembling with fear."Beauty," said he, "will you give me leave to see you sup?""That is as you please," answered she, very much afraid."Not in the least," said the beast; "you alone command in this place.If you should not like my company, you need only say so, and I willleave you that moment.  But tell me, Beauty, do you not think me veryugly?""'Why, yes," said she, "for I cannot tell a falsehood; but then I thinkyou are very good.""Am I?" sadly replied the beast; "yet, besides being ugly, I am alsovery stupid; I know well enough that I am but a beast.""Very stupid people," said Beauty, "are never aware of it themselves."At which kindly speech the beast looked pleased, and replied, notwithout an awkward sort of politeness, "Pray do not let me detain youfrom supper, and be sure that you are well served.  All you see is yourown, and I should be deeply grieved if you wanted for anything.""You are very kind-so kind that I almost forgot you are so ugly," saidBeauty, earnestly."Ah! yes," answered the beast, with a great sigh; "I hope I am good-tempered, but still I am only a monster.""There is many a monster who wears the form of a man; it is better ofthe two to have the heart of a man and the form of a monster.""I would thank you, Beauty, for this speech, but I am too senseless tosay anything that would please you," returned the beast in a melancholyvoice; and altogether he seemed so gentle and so unhappy that Beauty,who had the tenderest heart in the world, felt her fear of himgradually vanish.She ate her supper with a good appetite, and conversed in her ownsensible and charming way, till at last, when the beast rose to depart,he terrified her more than ever by saying abruptly, in his gruff voice,"Beauty, will you marry me?"Now Beauty, frightened as she was, would speak only the exact truth;besides her father had told her that the beast liked only to have thetruth spoken to him.  So she answered, in a very firm tone, "No,beast."He did not get into a passion, or do anything but sigh deeply, anddepart.When Beauty found herself alone, she began to feel pity for the poorbeast.  "Oh!" said she, "what a sad thing it is that he should be sovery frightful, since he is so good-tempered!"Beauty lived three months in this palace very well pleased.  The beastcame to see her every night, and talked with her while she supped; andthough what he said was not very clever, yet, as she saw in him everyday some new goodness, instead of dreading the time of his coming, shesoon began continually looking at her watch, to see if it were nineo'clock; for that was the hour when he never failed to visit her.  Onething only vexed her, which was that every night before he went away,he always made it a rule to ask her if she would be his wife, andseemed very much grieved at her steadfastly replying "No."  At last,one night, she said to him, "You wound me greatly, beast, by forcing meto refuse you so often; I wish I could take such a liking to you as toagree to marry you; but I must tell you plainly that I do not think itwill ever happen.  I shall always be your friend; so try to let thatcontent you."I must," sighed the beast, "for I know well enough how frightful I am;but I love you better than myself.  Yet I think I am very lucky in yourbeing pleased to stay with me; now promise, Beauty, that you will neverleave me.Beauty would almost have agreed to this, so sorry was she for him, butshe had that day seen in her magic glass, which she looked atconstantly, that her father was dying of grief for her sake."Alas!" she said, "I long so much to see my father, that if you do notgive me leave to visit him, I shall break my heart.""I would rather break mine, Beauty," answered the beast; "I will sendyou to your father's cottage: you shall stay there, and your poor beastshall die of sorrow.""No," said Beauty, crying, "I love you too well to be the cause of yourdeath; I promise to return in a week.  You have shown me that mysisters are married, and my brothers are gone for soldiers, so that myfather is left all alone.  Let me stay a week with him.""You shall find yourself with him to-morrow morning," replied thebeast; "but mind, do not forget your promise.  When you wish to return,you have nothing to do but to put your ring on a table when you go tobed.  Good-by, Beauty!"  The beast sighed as he said these words, andBeauty went to bed very sorry to see him so much grieved.  When sheawoke in the morning, she found herself in her father's cottage.  Sherang a bell that was at her bedside, and a servant entered; but as soonas she saw Beauty the woman gave a loud shriek; upon which the merchantran upstairs, and when he beheld his daughter he ran to her, and kissedher a hundred times.  At last Beauty began to remember that she hadbrought no clothes with her to put on; but the servant told her she hadjust found in the next room a large chest full of dresses, trimmed allover with gold, and adorned within pearls and diamonds.Beauty, in her own mind, thanked the beast for his kindness, and put onthe plainest gown she could find among them all.  She then desired theservant to lay the rest aside, for she intended to give them to hersisters; but, as soon as she had spoken these words, the chest was goneout of sight in a moment.  Her father then suggested, perhaps the beastchose for her to keep them all for herself: and as soon as he had saidthis, they saw the chest standing again in the same place.  WhileBeauty was dressing herself, a servant brought word to her that hersisters were come with their husbands to pay her a visit.  They bothlived unhappily with the gentlemen they had married.  The husband ofthe eldest was very handsome, but was so proud of this that he thoughtof nothing else from morning till night, and did not care a pin for thebeauty of his wife.  The second had married a man of great learning;but he made no use of it, except to torment and affront all hisfriends, and his wife more than any of them.  The two sisters wereready to burst with spite when they saw Beauty dressed like a princess,and looking so very charming.  All the kindness that she showed themwas of no use; for they were vexed more than ever when she told themhow happy she lived at the palace of the beast.  The spiteful creatureswent by themselves into the garden, where they cried to think of hergood fortune."Why should the little wretch be better off than we?" said they.  "Weare much handsomer than she is.""Sister!" said the eldest, "a thought has just come into my head; letus try to keep her here longer than the week for which the beast gaveher leave; and then he will be so angry that perhaps when she goes backto him he will eat her up in a moment.''"That is well thought of," answered the other, "but to do this, we mustpretend to be very kind."They then went to join her in the cottage, where they showed her somuch false love that Beauty could not help crying for joy.When the week was ended, the two sisters began to pretend such grief atthe thought of her leaving them that she agreed to stay a week more;but all that time Beauty could not help fretting for the sorrow thatshe knew her absence would give her poor beast for she tenderly lovedhim, and much wished for his company again.  Among all the grand andclever people she saw, she found nobody who was half so sensible, soaffectionate, so thoughtful, or so kind.  The tenth night of her beingat the cottage, she dreamed she was in the garden of the palace, thatthe beast lay dying on a grass plot, and with his last breath put herin mind of her promise, and laid his death to her forsaking him.Beauty awoke in a great fright, and she burst into tears.  "Am not Iwicked," said she, "to behave so ill to a beast who has shown me somuch kindness?  Why will I not marry him?  I am sure I should be morehappy with him than my sisters are with their husbands.  He shall notbe wretched any longer on my account; for I should do nothing but blamemyself all the rest of my life."She then rose, put her ring on the table, got into bed again, and soonfell asleep.  In the morning she with joy found herself in the palaceof the beast.  She dressed herself very carefully, that she mightplease him the better, and thought she had never known a day pass awayso slowly.  At last the clock struck nine, but the beast did not come.Beauty, dreading lest she might truly have caused his death, ran fromroom to room, calling out: "Beast, dear beast;" but there was noanswer.  At last she remembered her dream, rushed to the grass plot,and there saw him lying apparently dead beside the fountain.Forgetting all his ugliness, she threw herself upon his body, andfinding his heart still beating, she fetched some water and sprinkledit over him, weeping and sobbing the while.The beast opened his eyes.  "You forgot your promise, Beauty, and so Idetermined to die; for I could not live without you.  I have starvedmyself to death, but I shall die content since I have seen your faceonce more.""No, dear beast," cried Beauty, passionately, "you shall not die; youshall live to be my husband.  I thought it was only friendship I feltfor you, but now I know it was love."The moment Beauty had spoken these words, the palace was suddenlylighted up, and all kinds of rejoicings were heard around them, none ofwhich she noticed, but hung over her dear beast with the utmosttenderness.  At last, unable to restrain herself, she dropped her headover her hands, covered her eyes, and cried for joy; and, when shelooked up again, the beast was gone.  In his stead she saw at her feeta handsome, graceful young prince, who thanked her with the tenderestexpressions for having freed him from enchantment."But where is my poor beast?  I only want him and nobody else," sobbedBeauty."I am he," replied the prince.  "A wicked fairy condemned me to thisform, and forbade me to show that I had any wit or sense, till abeautiful lady should consent to marry me.  You alone, dearest Beauty,judged me neither by my looks nor by my talents, but by my heart alone.Take it then, and all that I have besides, for all is yours."Beauty, full of surprise, but very happy, suffered the prince to leadher to his palace, where she found her father and sisters, who had beenbrought there by the fairy-lady whom she had seen in a dream the firstnight she came."Beauty," said the fairy, "you have chosen well, and you have yourreward, for a true heart is better than either good looks or cleverbrains.  As for you, ladies," and she turned to the two elder sisters,"I know all your ill deeds, but I have no worse punishment for you thanto see your sister happy.  You shall stand as statues at the door ofher palace, and when you repent of, and have amended your faults, youshall become women again.  But, to tell you the truth, I very much fearyou will remain statues forever."JACK AND THE BEANSTALKAnonymousONCE upon a time there was a poor widow who lived in a little cottagewith her only son Jack.Jack was a giddy, thoughtless boy, but very kindhearted andaffectionate.  There had been a hard winter, and after it the poorwoman had suffered from fever and ague.  Jack did no work as yet, andby degrees they grew dreadfully poor.  The widow saw that there was nomeans of keeping Jack and herself from starvation but by selling hercow; so one morning she said to her son, "I am too weak to go myself,Jack, so you must take the cow to market for me, and sell her."Jack liked going to market to sell the cow very much; but as he was onhis way, he met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand.Jack stopped to look at them, and the butcher told the boy that theywere of great value, and persuaded the silly lad to sell the cow forthese beans.  When he brought them home to his mother instead of themoney she expected for her nice cow, she was very vexed and shed manytears, scolding Jack for his folly.  He was very sorry, and mother andson went to bed very sadly that night; their last hope seemed gone.At daybreak Jack rose and went out into the garden."At least," he thought, "I will sow the wonderful beans.  Mother saysthat they are just common scarlet-runners, and nothing else; but I mayas well sow them."So he took a piece of stick, and made some holes in the ground, and putin the beans.That day they had very little dinner, and went sadly to bed, knowingthat for the next day there would be none, and Jack, unable to sleepfrom grief and vexation, got up at day-dawn and went out into thegarden.What was his amazement to find that the beans had grown up in thenight, and climbed up and up till they covered the high cliff thatsheltered the cottage, and disappeared above it!  The stalks had twinedand - twisted themselves together till they formed quite a ladder."It would be easy to climb it," thought Jack.And, having thought of the experiment, he at once resolved to carry itout, for Jack was a good climber.  However, after his late mistakeabout the cow, he thought he had better consult his mother first.So Jack called his mother, and they both gazed in silent wonder at theBeanstalk, which was not only of great height, but it was thick enoughto bear Jack's weight."I wonder where it ends," said Jack to his mother; "I think I willclimb up and see."His mother wished him not to venture up this strange ladder, but Jackcoaxed her to give her consent to the attempt, for he was certain theremust be something wonderful in the Beanstalk; so at last she yielded tohis wishes.Jack instantly began to climb, and went up and up on the ladder-likebean till everything he had left behind him-the cottage, the village,and even the tall church tower-looked quite little, and still he couldnot see the top of the Beanstalk.Jack felt a little tired, and thought for a moment that he would goback again; but he was a very persevering boy, and he knew that the wayto succeed in anything is not to give up.  So, after resting for amoment, he went on.After climbing higher and higher, till he grew afraid to look down forfear he should be giddy, Jack at last reached the top of the Beanstalk,and found himself in a beautiful country, finely wooded, with beautifulmeadows covered with sheep.  A crystal stream ran through the pastures;not far from the place where he had got off the Beanstalk stood a fine,strong castle.Jack wondered very much that he had never heard of or seen this castlebefore; but when he reflected on the subject, he saw that it was asmuch separated from the village by the perpendicular rock on which itstood as if it were in another land.While Jack was standing looking at the castle, a very strange-lookingwoman came out of the wood and advanced toward him.She wore a pointed cap of quilted red satin turned up with ermine, herhair streamed loose over her shoulders, and she walked with a staff.Jack took off his cap and made her a bow."If you please, ma'am," said he, "is this your house?""No," said the old lady.  "Listen, and I will tell you the story ofthat castle.""Once upon a time there was a noble knight, who lived in this castle,which is on the borders of Fairyland.  He had a fair and beloved wifeand several lovely children; and as his neighbors, the little people,were very friendly toward him, they bestowed on him many excellent andprecious gifts."Rumor whispered of these treasures; and a monstrous giant who lived ata great distance, and who was a very wicked being, resolved to obtainpossession of them."So he bribed a false servant to let him inside the castle, when theknight was in bed and asleep, and he killed him as he lay.  Then hewent to the part of the castle which was the nursery, and also killedall the poor little ones he found there."Happily for her, the lady was not to be found.  She had gone with herinfant son, who was only two or three months old, to visit her oldnurse, who lived in the valley; and she had been detained all nightthere by a storm."The next morning, as soon as it was light, one of the servants at thecastle, who had managed to escape, came to tell the poor lady of thesad fate of her husband and her pretty babes.  She could scarcelybelieve him at first, and was eager at once to go back and share thefate of her dear ones; but the old nurse, with many tears, besought herto remember that she had still a child, and that it was her duty topreserve her life for the sake of the poor innocent."The lady yielded to this reasoning, and consented to remain at hernurse's house as the best place of concealment; for the servant toldher that the Giant had vowed, if he could find her, he would kill bothher and her baby.  Years rolled on.  The old nurse died, leaving hercottage and the few articles of furniture it contained to her poorlady, who dwelt in it, working as a peasant for her daily bread.  Herspinning-wheel and the milk of a cow which she had purchased with thelittle money she had with her, sufficed for the scanty subsistence ofherself and her little son.  There was a nice little garden attached tothe cottage, in which they cultivated peas, beans, and cabbages, andthe lady was not ashamed to go out at harvest time and glean in thefields to supply her little son's wants."Jack, that poor lady is your mother.  This castle was once yourfather's, and must again be yours.Jack uttered a cry of surprise."My mother!  oh, madam, what ought I to do?  My poor father!  My dearmother!""Your duty requires you to win it back for your mother.  But the taskis a very difficult one, and full of peril, Jack.  Have you courage toundertake it?"  "I fear nothing when I am doing right," said Jack."Then," said the lady in the red cap, "you are one of those who slaygiants.  You must get into the castle, and if possible possess yourselfof a hen that lays golden eggs, and a harp that talks.  Remember, allthe Giant possesses is really yours."As she ceased speaking, the lady of the red hat suddenly disappeared,and of course Jack knew she was a fairy.Jack determined at once to attempt the adventure; so he advanced, andblew the horn which hung at the castle portal.  The door was opened ina minute or two by a frightful Giantess, with one great eye in themiddle of her forehead.As soon as Jack saw her he turned to run away, but she caught him, anddragged him into the castle."Ho, ho!" she laughed terribly.  "You didn't expect to see me here,that is clear!  No, I shan't let you go again.  I am weary of my life.I am so overworked, and I don't see why I should not have a page aswell as other ladies.  And you shall be my boy.  You shall clean theknives, and black the boots, and make the fires, and help me generallywhen the Giant is out.  When he is at home I must hide you, for he haseaten up all my pages hitherto, and you would be a dainty morsel, mylittle lad."While she spoke she dragged Jack right into the castle.  The poor boywas very much frightened, as I am sure you and I would have been in hisplace.  But he remembered that fear disgraces a man; so he struggled tobe brave and make the best of things.  "I am quite ready to help you,and do all I can to serve you, madam," he said, "only I beg you will begood enough to hide me from your husband, for I should not like to beeaten at all.""That's a good boy," said the Giantess, nodding her head; "it is luckyfor you that you did not scream out when you saw me, as the other boyswho have been here did, for if you had done so my husband would haveawakened and have eaten you, as he did them, for breakfast.  Come here,child; go into my wardrobe: he never ventures to open that; you will besafe there."And she opened a huge wardrobe which stood in the great hall, and shuthim unto it.  But the keyhole was so large that it admitted plenty ofair, and he could see everything that took place through it.  By and byhe heard a heavy tramp on the stairs, like the lumbering along of agreat cannon, and then a voice like thunder cried out:"Fe, fa, fi-fo-fum,I smell the breath of an Englishman.Let him be alive or let him be dead,I'll grind his bones to make my bread.""Wife," cried the Giant, "there is a man in the castle.  Let me havehim for breakfast.""You are grown old and stupid," cried the lady, in her loud tones.  "Itis only a nice fresh steak off an elephant, that I have cooked for you,which you smell.  There, sit down and make a good breakfast."And she placed a huge dish before him of savory steaming meat, whichgreatly pleased him, and made him forget his idea of an Englishmanbeing in the castle.  When he had breakfasted he went out for a walk,and then the Giantess opened the door, and made Jack come out to helpher.  He helped her all day.  She fed him well, and when evening cameput him back in the wardrobe.The Giant came in to supper.  Jack watched him through the keyhole, andwas amazed to see him pick a wolf's bone, and put half a fowl at a timeinto his capacious mouth.When the supper was ended he bade his wife bring him his hen that laidthe golden eggs."It lays as well as it did when it belonged to that paltry knight," hesaid; "indeed, I think the eggs are heavier than ever."The Giantess went away, and soon returned with a little brown hen,which she placed on the table before her husband."And now, my dear," she said, "I am going for a walk, if you don't wantme any longer.""Go, said the Giant; "I shall be glad to have a nap by and by."Then he took up the brown hen and said to her:"Lay!" And she instantly laid a golden egg."Lay!" said the Giant again.  And she laid another."Lay!" he repeated the third time.  And again a golden egg lay on thetable.Now, Jack was sure this hen was that of which the fairy had spoken.By and by the Giant put the hen down on the floor, and soon after wentfast asleep, snoring so loud that it sounded like thunder.Directly Jack perceived that the Giant was fast asleep, he pushed openthe door of the wardrobe and crept out; very softly he stole across theroom, and, picking up the hen, made haste to quit the apartment.  heknew the way to the kitchen, the door of which he found was left ajar;he opened it, shut and locked it after him, and flew back to theBeanstalk, which he descended as fast as his feet would move.When his mother saw him enter the house she wept for joy, for she hadfeared that the fairies had carried him away, or that the Giant hadfound him.  But Jack put the brown hen down before her, and told herhow he had been in the Giant's castle, and all his adventures.  She wasvery glad to see the hen, which would make them rich once more.Jack made another journey up the Beanstalk to the Giant's castle oneday while his mother had gone to market; but first he dyed his hair anddisguised himself.  The old woman did not know him again, and draggedhim in as she had done before, to help her to do the work; but sheheard her husband coming, and hid him in the wardrobe, not thinkingthat it was the same boy who had stolen the hen.  She bade him stayquite still there, or the Giant would eat him.  Then the Giant came in,saying:"Fe, fa, fi-fo-furn,I smell the breath of an Englishman.Let him he alive or let him be dead,I'll grind his bones to make my bread.""Nonsense!" said the wife, "it is only a roasted bullock that I thoughtwould be a titbit for your supper; sit down and I will bring it up atonce.The Giant sat down, and soon his wife brought up a roasted bullock on alarge dish, and they began their supper.  Jack was amazed to see thempick the bones of the bullock as if it had been a lark.  As soon asthey had finished their meal, the Giantess rose and said:"Now, my dear, with your leave I am going up to my room to finish thestory I am reading.  If you want me, call for me.""First," answered the Giant, "bring me my money bags, that I may countmy golden pieces before I sleep."  The Giantess obeyed.  She went andsoon returned with two large bags over her shoulders, which she putdown by her husband."There," she said: "that is all that is left of the knight's money.When you have spent it you must go and take another baron's castle.""That he shan't, if I can help it," thought Jack.The Giant, when his wife was gone, took out heaps and heaps of goldenpieces, and counted them, and put them in piles, till he was tired ofthe amusement.  Then he swept them all back into their bags, andleaning back in his chair fell fast asleep, snoring so loud that noother sound was audible.Jack stole softly out of the wardrobe, and taking up the bags of money(which were his very own, because the Giant had stolen them from hisfather), he ran off, and with great difficulty descending theBeanstalk, laid the bags of gold on his mother's table.  She had justreturned from town, and was crying at not finding Jack.  "There,mother, I have brought you the gold that my father lost.""Oh, Jack!  you are a very good boy, but I wish you would not risk yourprecious life in the Giant's castle.  Tell me how you came to go thereagain."And Jack told her all about it.Jack's mother was very glad to get the money, but she did not like himto run any risk for her.But after a time Jack made up his mind to go again to the Giant'scastle.So he climbed the Beanstalk once more, and blew the horn at the Giant'sgate.  The Giantess soon opened the door; she was very stupid, and didnot know him again,.  but she stopped a minute before she took him in.She feared another robbery; but Jack's fresh face looked so innocentthat she could not resist him, and so she bade him come in, and againhid him away in the wardrobe.By and by the Giant came home, and as soon as he had crossed thethreshold he roared out: "Fe, fa, li-fo-fum,I smell the breath of an Englishman.Let him be alive or let him be dead,I'll grind his bones to make my bread.""You stupid old Giant," said his wife, "you only smell a nice sheep,which I have grilled for your dinner.'And the Giant sat down, and his wife brought up a whole sheep for hisdinner.  When he had eaten it all up, he said:"Now bring me my harp, and I will have a little music while you takeyour walk."The Giantess obeyed, and returned with a beautiful harp.  The frameworkwas all sparkling with diamonds and rubies, and the strings were all ofgold."This is one of the nicest things I took from the knight," Said theGiant.  "I am very fond of music, and my harp is a faithful servant."So he drew the harp toward him  and said:"Play!"And the harp played a very soft, sad air."Play something merrier!" said the Giant.And the harp played a merry tune."Now play me a lullaby," roared the Giant; and the harp played a sweetlullaby, to the sound of which its master fell asleep.Then Jack stole softly out of the wardrobe, and went into the hugekitchen to see if the Giantess had gone out; he found no one there, sohe went to the door and opened it softly, for he thought he could notdo so with the harp in his hand.Then he entered the Giant's room and seized the harp and ran away withit; but as he jumped over the threshold the harp called out: "MASTER!MASTER!"And the Giant woke up.With a tremendous roar he sprang from his seat, and in two strides hadreached the door.But Jack was very nimble.  He fled like lightning with the harp,talking to it as he went (for he saw it was a fairy), and telling it hewas the son of its old master, the knight.Still the Giant came on so fast that he was quite close to poor Jack,and had stretched out his great hand to catch him.  But, luckily, justat that moment he stepped upon a loose stone, stumbled, and fell flaton the ground, where he lay at his full length.This accident gave Jack time to get on the Bean stalk and hasten downit; but just as he reached their own garden he beheld the Giantdescending after him."Mother!  mother!" cried Jack, "make haste and give me the ax."His mother ran to him with a hatchet in her hand, and Jack with onetremendous blow cut through all the Beanstalks except one."Now, mother, stand out of the way!" said he.  Jack's mother shrankback, and it was well she did so, for just as the Giant took hold ofthe last branch of the Beanstalk, Jack cut the stem quite through anddarted from the spot.Down came the Giant with a terrible crash, and as he fell on his head,he broke his neck, and lay dead at the feet of the woman he had so muchinjured.Before Jack and his mother had recovered from their alarm andagitation, a beautiful lady stood before them."Jack," said she, "you have acted like a brave knight's son, anddeserve to have your inheritance restored to you.  Dig a grave and burythe Giaint, and then go and kill the Giantess.""But," said Jack, "I could not kill any one unless I were fighting withhim; and I could not draw my sword upon a woman.  Moreover, theGiantess was very kind to me."The Fairy smiled on Jack."I am very much pleased with your generous feeling," she said."Nevertheless, return to the castle, and act as you will find needful."Jack asked the Fairy if she would show him the way to the castle, asthe Beanstalk was now down.  She told him that she would drive himthere in her chariot, which was drawn by two peacocks.  Jack thankedher, and sat down in the chariot with her.The Fairy drove him a long distance round, till they reached a villagewhich lay at the bottom of the mill.  Here they found a number ofmiserable-looking men assembled.  The Fairy stopped her carriage andaddressed them:"My friends," said she, "the cruel Giant who oppressed you and ate upall your flocks and herds is dead, and this young gentleman was themeans of your being delivered from him, and is the son of your kind oldmaster, the knight."The men gave a loud cheer at these words, and pressed forward to saythat they would serve Jack as faithfully as they had served his father.The Fairy bade them follow her to the castle, and they marched thitherin a body, and Jack blew the horn and demanded admittance.The old Giantess saw them coming from the turret loophole.  She wasvery much frightened, for she guessed that something had happened toher husband; and as she came downstairs very fast she caught her footin her dress, and fell from the top to the bottom and broke her neck.When the people outside found that the door was not opened to them,they took crowbars and forced the portal.  Nobody was to be seen, buton leaving the mall they found the body of the Giantess at the foot ofthe stairs.Thus Jack took possession of the castle.  The Fairy went and broughthis mother to him, with the hen and the harp.  He had the Giantessburied, and endeavored as much as lay in his power to do right to thosewhom the Giant had robbed.Before her departure for fairyland, the Fairy explained to Jack thatshe had sent the butcher to meet him with the beans, in order to trywhat sort of lad he was."If you had looked at the gigantic Beanstalk and only stupidly wonderedabout it," she said, "I should have left you where misfortune hadplaced you, only restoring her cow to your mother.  But you showed aninquiring mind, and great courage and enterprise, therefore you deserveto rise; and when you mounted the Beanstalk you climbed the Ladder ofFortune."She then took her leave of Jack and his mother.HOP-O'-MY-THUMBRetold by Joseph JacobsONCE upon a time there was a Wood-cutter and his wife who had sevenchildren, all boys.  The eldest was only ten years old.  They were verypoor, and their seven children were a great burden, since not one ofthem was able to earn his living.What troubled them still more was the fact that the youngest was notonly very delicate, but silent, which they took for stupidity, butwhich was really a mark of his good sense.  He was very small, and whenhe was born he was scarcely bigger than one's thumb, which caused himto be called little "Hop-o'-My-Thumb."  This poor child was thescapegoat of the house, and was blamed for everything.  He was,however, sharper and wiser than all his brothers, and though he spokelittle, he listened a great deal.At last there came a bad year, and so great a famine, that the poorpeople resolved to rid themselves of their children.  One evening, whenthe children were all in bed, and the Wood-cutter with a sorrowfulheart, was sitting by the fire with his wife, he said to her: "You knowthat we can no longer support our children.  I cannot let them die ofhunger before my eyes, and I am resolved to take them to the wood to-morrow, and lose them.  It will be easy to do this, for, while theyamuse themselves tying my sticks, we have only to slip away withouttheir seeing us."Ah!" cried his Wife, "would you then destroy your children?"   In vaindid her husband set forth to her their great poverty: she would notconsent.  She was poor, she said.  But she was their mother.  At last,having considered what a grief it would be to her to have them die ofhunger before her eyes, she agreed to her husband's plan, and went,weeping, to bed.Hop-o'-My-Thumb had listened to all that they had said, for havingheard them, from his bed, talking of family matters, he had risensoftly and slipped under his father's stool, in order to hear withoutbeing seen.  He then went back to bed, but lay awake the rest of thenight, thinking what he should do.  He rose early and went to a brook,where he filled his pocket with little white pebbles, and then returnedto the house.Soon after, they all set off, but Hop-o'-My-Thumb did not tell hisbrothers anything of what he knew.  They went into a forest, so thickthat they could not see each other at a distance of ten paces.  TheWood-cutter began to fell a tree, while the children gathered sticks tomake up into bundles.  The father and mother, seeing them thusemployed, slipped away unnoticed, and then fled rapidly, by a littlewinding path.When the children found they were alone, they began to scream and crywith all their strength.  Hop-o'-My-Thumb let them cry, knowing wellhow to get home; for, while walking, he had dropped along the path thelittle white pebbles which he had in his pockets.He therefore said to them, "Fear not, brothers, my father and motherhave left us here, but I will lead you to the house only follow me."They obeyed at once, and he led them home along the same path by whichthey had come into the forest at first.  They did not dare to go intothe house, but placed themselves near the door, in order to hear whattheir father and mother were saying.Now it had so happened that, just as the Woodcutter and his Wifereached home, the lord of the village had sent them ten crowns, whichhe had long owed them, and which they had never hoped to obtain.  Thisgave them new life, for the poor creatures were almost dead fromhunger.The Wood-cutter immediately sent his Wife to the butcher's, where, asit was long since they had eaten anything, she bought three times asmuch meat as was needed for the supper of two people.When they were seated at table, the Wife said, "Alas!  where now areour poor children?  They would make good cheer with what we have left.But it is you who wished to lose them.  I always said we should repentit.  What are they doing now in the forest?  Alas!  alas!  perhaps thewolves have already eaten them!  You were most cruel thus to lose yourchildren."The Wood-cutter at last grew impatient, for she repeated more thantwenty times that they would repent what they had done, and that shehad told him so.  He threatened to beat her if she was not silent.  TheWood-cutter did not do this because he was less sorry than his Wife,but because her reproaches angered him.  His Wife now shed tears, andcried out, "Alas!  where are my children, my poor children?"She said this so loud that the children, who were at the door, heardher, and all cried out together, "Here we are!  here we are!"She ran quickly to open the door, and said, as she embraced them, "Howoverjoyed I am to see you again, my darling children!  you must be verytired and very hungry; and you, Peter, how muddy you are!  come, let mebrush you."  Peter was her eldest son, whom she loved more than all theothers.The children then sat down at the table, and ate with an appetite whichdelighted their father and mother, to whom they described, all speakingat once, how frightened they had been in the forest.These good people were filled with joy to have their children with themagain, and this joy lasted as long as the ten crowns held out.  Butwhen the money was spent, they fell back into their former misery, andresolved to lose them once more; and in order not to fail again, theydetermined to take them much further into the forest than the firsttime.They could not, however, speak of this so secretly but that they wereoverheard by Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who laid his plans to escape as before.Although he got up early in order to go out and pick up some littlestones, he could not succeed in his purpose, for he found the door ofthe house shut and double-bolted.  He was wondering what he should do,when, his mother having given them each a bit of bread for breakfast,he thought that he might use his bread instead of pebbles by droppingcrumbs along the paths as they walked.  He therefore slipped the breadinto his pocket.Their father and mother led them this time into the thickest anddarkest part of the forest, and, as soon as they were there, ran awayand left them.Hop-o'-My-Thumb was not much troubled, because he believed he couldeasily find his way by means of the bread which he had scattered as hepassed along.  What was his surprise when he could not find a singlecrumb: the birds had come and eaten it all.Now was their lot indeed wretched; the more they wandered about, thedeeper they buried themselves in the forest.  Night came, and a greatwind arose which frightened them terribly.  They thought they heard onall sides the howling of hungry wolves coming to eat them up.  They didnot dare to speak, or even turn their heads.  Rain began to fall, whichwet them to the skin.  They slipped at every step, and, if they fell,got up so covered with mud that they could hardly move their hands.Finally, Hop-o'-My-Thumb climbed to the top of a tree, to see if hecould not discover something.  Having looked on all sides, he at lastsaw a little gleam of light, like that from a candle, but it was veryfar off, beyond the forest.  He got down from the tree: but when he wason the ground he no longer saw anything, which troubled him greatly.However, having walked for some time with his brothers in the directionwhere he had seen the light, he again saw it as they came out of thewood.  At last they reached the house where the candle was, though notwithout many alarms, for they lost sight of it whenever they descendedunto a hollow place.They knocked at the door, which was opened to them by a woman.  Sheasked them what they wanted.  Hop-o'-My-Thumb replied that they werepoor children who had lost themselves in the forest, and who asked, forcharity's sake, a place to sleep.The woman, seeing how bitter they were, began to weep, and said tothem, "Alas!  my poor children, whence do you come?  Do you not knowthat this is the house of an Ogre, who eats little children?""Alas, madam," said Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who like his brothers was shakingwith fear, "what shall we do?  The wolves of the forest will certainlydevour us to-night, if you will not give us shelter.  This being thecase, we had rather be eaten by the Ogre, and he, perhaps, will takepity on us, if you will beg him to do so."The Ogre's wife, who thought she might be able to conceal them from herhusband till the next morning, let them come in, and placed them near agood fire, where a whole sheep was roasting for the Ogre's supper.When they had begun to get warm, they heard three or four heavy knocksat the door.  It was the Ogre.  His wife hastily hid the children underthe bed, and then opened the door.The Ogre asked first if supper was ready, and the wine drawn; and thensat down at the table.  The mutton was nearly raw, but he liked it allthe better on that account.He then began to sniff about, saying that he smelled fresh meat."It must be this calf which I have just been dressing that you smell,"said the wife."I smell fresh meat, I tell you again," said the Ogre, looking fiercelyat his wife; "and there is something more of which I do not know."Saying these words, he rose from the table and went straight to thebed, where he found the poor children."Ah!" said he, "this, then, is the way you wish to deceive me, wickedwoman.  I know not what prevents me from eating you, too.  Here isgame, which comes to me very conveniently to treat three Ogres of myacquaintance, who are coming to visit me about this time."He then drew the little boys from under the bed, one after another.The poor children threw themselves on their knees begging for pardon.But they had to do with the most cruel of all the Ogres, who, far fromhaving pity, devoured them already with his eyes, and said to his wifethat they would be delicious morsels fried, when she had made a goodsauce for them.He took out a great knife, and, approaching the poor children, began tosharpen it on a long stone, which he held in his left hand.  He thenseized one of them, when his wife said to him, "Why do you begin atthis time of night?  Shall you not have time to-morrow?""Be silent," replied the Ogre; "they will be more tender if I kill themnow.""But you have already so much meat on hand," replied his wife.  "Hereare a calf, two sheep, and half a pig.""You are right," said the Ogre; "give them a good supper, that they maynot grow thin, and put them to bed."The good woman was overcome with joy, and brought them their supper atonce; but they were too frightened to eat.As for the Ogre, he set himself to drinking, delighted to havesomething with which to regale his friends.  He drank a dozen cups morethan usual, which went to his head, and obliged him to go early to bed.Now this Ogre had seven daughters, who were still only children.  Theselittle Ogresses all had beautiful complexions, for they ate fresh meatlike their father.  They had little round gray eyes, crooked noses, andgreat mouths filled with long teeth, very sharp and far apart.  Theywere not yet very wicked, but they promised well, for they already bitlittle children whenever they got the chance.  They had been put to bedearly, and were all seven in one bed, each having a golden crown on herhead.There was in the same room anther bed of the same size.  Here it wasthat the Ogre's wife put the seven little boy's, after which she wentto bed in her own chamber.Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who had remarked that the Ogre's daughters had goldencrowns on their heads, was afraid that the Ogre might regret not havingkilled him and his brothers that evening.  So he rose about the middleof the night, and, taking his nightcap and those of his brothers, hewent very softly and placed them on the heads of the Ogre's sevendaughters, after having removed their golden crowns.  He then put thecrowns on his brothers' heads and on his own, so that the Ogre mightmistake them for his daughters, and his daughters for the boys whom hewished to kill.The plan succeeded as he had expected.  The Ogre, having awakened aboutmidnight, was sorry that he had put off till next day what he mighthave done that evening.  He jumped quickly out of bed, and, taking hisgreat knife, "Let us see," said he, "how our little friends are gettingon."He went on tiptoe to the room of his daughters, and approached the bedwhere the little boys were all asleep, except Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who wasterribly frightened when he felt the Ogre's hand touching his head, ashe had already touched his brothers'.  But when the Ogre felt thegolden crowns, he said, "Indeed, I was near making a nice piece of workof it.  I see that I drank too much in the evening."He then went to the bed of his daughters, where he felt the boys'little nightcaps.  "Ah!  here they are," said he, "the fine fellows!  Imust go boldly to work.  Saying these words, and without hesitating, hecut the throats of his seven daughters.  Very well pleased with hisexpedition, he went back to bed.  As soon as Hop-o'-My-Thumb heard theOgre snoring, he awakened his brothers, and told them to dressthemselves quickly and follow him.  They went softly down unto thegarden, and leaped over the walls.  They hurried away, and ran almostall night, without knowing whither they went.The Ogre, when he woke up, said to his wife, "Go upstairs and dressthose little fellows who were here last night.''The Ogress was very much astonished at the kindness of her husband, notsuspecting for a moment the way in which he meant that she should dressthem.  Believing that he simply wished her to put on their clothes, shewent upstairs, where she was amazed to see her seven daughters withtheir throats cut.  She was so overcome that she immediately fainted.The Ogre, thinking his wife was too slow, went upstairs to assist her.He was no less astonished than his wife when the frightful sight methis eyes."Ah!  what have I done here?" he cried; "but those little wretchesshall pay for this, and at once."He then threw a bucket of water into his wife's face, and, havingrevived her, said, "Give me quickly my seven-league boots, that I maygo after those boys and catch them."He then started out into the country at once, and, having rushed aboutin all directions, came at last to the road where the poor childrenwere walking, and then not more than a hundred steps from theirfather's house.  They saw the Ogre striding from mountain to mountain,and crossing rivers as if they were little brooks.Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who saw a hollow rock near the place where they were,hid himself and his six brothers there, and watched carefully whatbecame of their enemy.  The Ogre, who was very tired with his long andfruitless journey, wished to rest himself, and sat down, by chance, onthe very rock where the little boys were hidden.As he was overcome with fatigue, he soon fell asleep, and began tosnore so frightfully that the poor children were as much frightened aswhen he held his knife ready to cut their throats.  Hop-o'-My-Thumb wasless afraid, and told his brothers to run into the house while the Ogreslept, and not to worry about him.  They followed his counsel, andquickly reached the house.Hop-o'-My-Thumb then approached the Ogre, softly drew off his boots,and put them on himself.  The boots were very long and very large; but,as they were fairy boots, they had the gift of becoming larger orsmaller, according to the size of the wearer's leg.  In fact, theyfitted Hop-o'-My-Thumb as if they had been made for him.He then went straight to the Ogre's house, where he found his wifeweeping over her daughters."Your husband," said Hop-o'-My-Thumb, "is in great danger, for he hasbeen taken by a band of robbers, who will kill him if he does not givethem all his gold and silver.  Just when they held their knives to histhroat he perceived me, and besought me to come and tell you of thestate in which he was, and to direct you to give me all that he has,without retaining anything, since otherwise they would slay him withoutmercy.  As time passed, he wished that I should take his seven-leagueboots, as you see, in order to make haste, and also that you might notthink me an impostor."The good woman, very much frightened, gave him all she had; for thisOgre was a good husband, although he did eat little children.Hop-o'-My-Thumb, being then loaded with all the Ogre's treasures,returned to his father's house, where he was welcomed with great joyand where they all lived happily ever after.THE GOOSE-GIRLAnonymousTHERE was once upon a time an old Queen whose husband had been dead formany years, and she had a beautiful daughter.  When the princess grewup she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance.  Whenthe time came for her to be married, and she had to ,journey forth intothe distant kingdom, the aged Queen packed up for her many costlyvessels of silver and gold, and trinkets also of gold and silver; andcups and jewels, in short, everything which appertained to a royaldowry, for she loved her child with all her heart.  She likewise senther maid in waiting, who was to ride with her, and hand her over to thebridegroom, and each had a horse for the journey, but the horse of theKing's daughter was called Falada, and could speak.  So when the hourof parting had come, the aged mother went into her bedroom, took asmall knife and cut her finger with it until it bled, then she held awhite handkerchief to it into which she left three drops of blood fall,gave it to her daughter and said: "Dear child, preserve this carefully,it will be of service to you on your way."So they took a sorrowful leave of each other: the princess put thepiece of cloth in her bosom, mounted her horse, and then went away toher bridegroom.  After she had ridden for a while she felt a burningthirst and said to her waiting-maid: "Dismount, and take my cup whichthou hast brought with thee for me, and get me some water from thestream, for I should like to drink."  "If you are thirsty," said thewaiting-maid, "get off your horse yourself, and lie down and drink outof the water; I don't choose to be your servant."  So in her greatthirst the princess alighted, bent down over the water in the streamand drank, and was not allowed to drink out of the golden cup.  Thenshe said, "Ah, Heaven!" and the three drops of blood answered:"If thy mother knew this, her heart would break."But the King's daughter was humble, said nothing, and mounted her horseagain.  She rode some miles further, but the day was warm, the sunscorched her, and she was thirsty once more, and when they came to astream of water, she again cried to her waiting-maid: "Dismount, andgive me some water in my golden cup," for she had long ago forgottenthe girl's ill words.  But the waiting-maid said still more haughtily:"If you wish to drink, drink as you can, I don't choose to be yourmaid."  Then in her great thirst the King's daughter alighted, bentover the flowing stream, wept and said: "Ah, heaven!" and the drops ofblood again replied: "If thy mother knew this, her heart would break."And as she was thus drinking and leaning right over the stream, thehandkerchief with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom, andfloated away with the water without her observing it, so great was hertrouble.The waiting-maid, however, had seen it, and she rejoiced to think thatshe had now power over the bride, for since the princess had lost thedrops of blood, she had become weak and powerless.  So now when shewanted to mount her horse again, the one that was called Falada, thewaiting-maid said: "Falada is more suitable for me, and my nag will dofor thee," and the princess had to be content with that.  Then thewaiting-maid, with many hard words, bade the princess exchange herroyal apparel for her own shabby clothes; and at length she wascompelled to swear by the clear sky above her, that she would not sayone word of this to any one at the royal court, and if she had nottaken this oath she would have been killed on the spot.  But Falada sawall this, and observed it well.The waiting-maid now mounted Falada, and the true bride the bad horse,and thus they traveled onward, until at length they entered the royalpalace.  There were great rejoicings over her arrival, and the princesprang forward to meet her, lifted the waiting-maid from her horse, andthought she was his consort.  She was conducted upstairs, but the realprincess was left standing below.  Then the old King looked out of thewindow and saw her standing in the courtyard, and how dainty anddelicate and beautiful she was, and instantly went to the royalapartment, and asked the bride about the girl she had with her who wasstanding down below in the courtyard, and who she was.  "I picked herup on my way for a companion; give the girl something to work at, thatshe may not stand idle."  But the old King had no work for her, andknew of none, so he said: "I have a little boy who tends the geese, shemay help him."  The boy was called Conrad, and the true bride had tohelp him to tend the geese.Soon afterward the false bride said to the young King: "Dearesthusband, I beg you to do me a favor."  He answered: "I will do so mostwillingly."  "Then send for the knacker, and have the head of the horseon which I rode here cut off, for it vexed me on the way."  In realityshe was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to theKing's daughter.  Then she succeeded in making the King promise that itshould be done, and the faithful Falada was to die; this came to theears of the real princess, and she secretly promised to pay the knackera piece of gold if he would perform a small service for her.  There wasa great dark-looking gateway in the town, through which morning andevening she had to pass with the geese: would he be so good as to nailup Falada's head on it, so that she might see him again, more thanonce.  The knacker's man promised to do that, and cut off the head, andnailed it fast beneath the dark gateway.Early in the morning, when she and Conrad drove out their flock beneaththis gateway, she said in passing:"Alas, Falada, hanging thereThen the head answered:"Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!If this your tender mother knew,Her heart would surely break in two."Then they went still further out of the town, and drove their geeseinto the country.  And when they had come to the meadow, she sat downand unbound her hair which was like pure gold, and Conrad saw it anddelighted in its brightness, and wanted to pluck out a few hairs.  Thenshe said:"Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,Blow Conrad's little hat away,And make him chase it here and there,Until I have braided all my hair,And bound it up again.And there came such a violent wind that it blew Conrad's hat far awayacross country, and he was forced to run after it.  When he came backshe had finished combing her hair and was putting it up again, and hecould not get any of it.  Then Conrad was angry, and would not speak toher, and thus they watered the geese until the evening, and then theywent home.Next day when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway,the maiden said:"Alas, Falada, hanging thereFalada answered:"Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!If this your tender mother knew,Her heart would surely break in two."And she sat down again in the field and began to comb out her hair, andConrad ran and tried to clutch it, so she said in haste:"Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,Blow Conrad's little hat away,And make him chase it here and there,Until I have braided all my hair,And bound it up again.Then the wind blew, and blew his little hat off his head and far away,and Conrad was forced to run after it, and when he came back, her hairhad been put up a long time, and he could get none of it, and so theylooked after their geese till evening came.But in the evening after they had got home, Conrad went to the oldKing, and said: "I won't tend the geese with that girl any longer!""Why not?" inquired the aged King.  "Oh, because she vexes me the wholeday long."  Then the aged King commanded him to relate what it was thatshe did to him.  And Conrad said: "In the morning when we pass beneaththe dark gateway with the flock, there is a sorry horse's head on thewall and she says to it:"Alas, Falada, hanging there!"And the head replies:"Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!If this your tender mother knew,Her heart would surely break in two."And Conrad went on to relate what happened on the goose pasture, andhow when there he had to chase his hat.The aged King commanded him to drive his flock out again next day, andas soon as morning came, he placed himself behind the dark gateway, andheard how the maiden spoke to the head of Falada, and then he too wentinto the country, and hid himself in the thicket in the meadow.  Therehe soon saw with his own eyes the goose-girl and the goose-boy bringingtheir flock, and how after a while she sat down and unplaited her hair,which shone with radiance.  And soon she said:"Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,Blow Conrad's little hat away,And make him chase it here and there,Until I have braided all my hair,And bound it up again."Then came a blast of wind and carried off Conrad's hat, so that he hadto run far away, while the maiden quietly went on combing and plaitingher hair, all of which the King observed.  Then, quite unseen, he wentaway, and when the goose-girl came home in the evening, he called heraside, and asked why she did all these things.  "I may not tell youthat, and I dare not lament my sorrows to any human being, for I havesworn not to do so by the heaven which is above me; if I had not donethat, I should have lost my life."  He urged her and left her no peace,but he could draw nothing from her.  Then said he: "If thou wilt nottell me anything, tell thy sorrows to the iron stove there," and hewent away.  Then she crept into the iron stove, and began to weep andlament, and emptied her whole heart, and said: "Here am I deserted bythe whole world, and yet I am a King's daughter, and a false waiting-maid has by force brought me to such a pass that I have been compelledto put off my royal apparel, and she has taken my place with mybridegroom, and I have to perform menial service as a goose-girl.  Ifmy mother did but know that, her heart would break."The aged King, however, was standing outside by the pipe of the stove,and was listening to what she said and heard it.  Then he came backagain, and bade her come out of the stove.  And royal garments wereplaced on her, and it was marvellous how beautiful she was!  The agedKing summoned his son, and revealed to him that he had got the falsebride who was only a waiting-maid, but that the true one was standingthere, as the sometime goose-girl.  The young King rejoiced with allhis heart when he saw her beauty and youth, and a great feast was madeready to which all the people and all good friends were invited.  Atthe head of the table sat the bridegroom with the King's daughter atone side of him and the waiting-maid on the other, but the waiting-maidwas blinded, and did not recognize the princess in her dazzling array.When they had eaten and drunk, and were merry, the aged King asked thewaiting-maid as a riddle, what a person deserved who had behaved insuch and such a way to her master, and at the same time related thewhole story, and asked what sentence such an one merited?  Then thefalse bride said: "She deserves no better fate than to be strippedentirely naked, and put in a barrel which is studded inside withpointed nails, and two white horses should be harnessed to it, whichwill drag her along through one street after another, till she isdead."  "It is thou," said the aged King, "and thou must pronouncethine own sentence, and thus shall it be done unto thee."  And when thesentence had been carried out, the young King married his true bride,and both of them reigned over their kingdom in peace and happiness.HE WHO KNEW NOT FEARAnonymousA CERTAIN father had two sons, the elder of whom was sharp andsensible, and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and couldneither learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him theysaid: "There's a fellow who will give his father some trouble!"  Whenanything had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to doit; but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or inthe night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any otherdismal place, he answered: "Oh, no, father, I'll not go there, it makesme shudder!" for he was afraid.  Or when stories were told by the fireat night which made the flesh creep, the listeners often said: "Oh, itmakes us shudder!" the younger sat in a corner and listened with therest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean.  "They arealways saying: 'It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!' It does notmake me shudder," thought he.  "That, too, must be an art of which Iunderstand nothing!"Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: "Hearken tome, thou fellow in the corner there, thou art growing tall and strong,and thou, too, must learn something by which thou canst earn thyliving.  Look how thy brother works, but thou dost not even earn thysalt."  "Well, father," he replied, "I am quite willing to learnsomething-indeed, if it could but be managed, I should like to learnhow to shudder.  I don't understand that at all yet."  The elderbrother smiled when he heard that, and thought to himself:"Good God, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!  He will never begood for anything as long as he lives!  He who wants to be a sicklemust bend himself betimes."The father sighed, and answered him: "Thou shalt soon learn what it isto suffer, but thou wilt not earn thy living by that."Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the fatherbewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backwardin every respect that he knew nothing and learned nothing.  "Justthink," said he, "when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread,he actually wanted to learn to shudder."  "If that be all," replied thesexton, "he can learn that with me.  Send him to me, and I will soonpolish him."  The father was glad to do it, for he thought: "It willtrain the boy a little."  The sexton, therefore, took him into hishouse, and he had to ring the bell.  After a day or two the sextonawoke him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the churchtower and ring the bell.  "Thou shalt soon learn what shuddering is,"thought he, and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was atthe top of the tower and turned around, and was just going to take holdof the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs oppositeto the sounding hole.  "Who is there?" cried he, but the figure made noreply, and did not move or stir.  "Give an answer," cried the boy, "ortake thyself off; thou hast no business here at night."The sexton, however, remained standing motionless, that the boy mightthink he was a ghost.  The boy cried a second time: "What dost thouwant here?-speak if thou art an honest fellow, or I will throw theedown the steps!"  The sexton thought, "He can't intend to be as bad ashis words," uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone.Then the boy called to him for the third time, and as that was also tono purpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, sothat it fell down ten steps and remained lying there in a corner.Thereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word wentto bed and fell asleep.  The sexton's wife waited a long time for herhusband, but he did not come back.  At length she became uneasy, andwakened the boy, and asked, "Dost thou not know where my husband is?He went up the tower before thou didst."  "No, I don't know," repliedthe boy, "but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the otherside of the steps, and as he would neither give an answer nor go away,I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him down stairs; just go thereand you will see if it was he, I should be sorry if it were."  Thewoman ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in thecorner, and had broken his leg.She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to theboy's father.  "Your boy," cried she, "has been the cause of a greatmisfortune!  He has thrown my husband down the steps and made him breakhis leg.  Take the good-for-nothing fellow away from our house."  Thefather was terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy.  "Whatwicked tricks are these?" said he; "the devil must have put this intothy head."  "Father," he replied, "do listen to me.  I am quiteinnocent.  He was standing there by night like one who is intending todo some evil.  I did not know who it was, and I entreated him threetimes either to speak or to go away."  "Ah," said the father, "I havenothing but unhappiness with thee.  Go out of my sight.  I will seethee no more.""Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day.  Then will Igo forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,understand one art which will support me."  "Learn what thou wilt,"spake the father, "it is all the same to me.  Here are fifty thalersfor thee.  Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one fromwhence thou comest, and who is thy father, for I have reason to beashamed of thee."  "Yes, father, it small be as you will.  If youdesire nothing more than that, I can easily keep it in mind."When day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty thalers into hispocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said tohimself, "If I could but shudder!  If I could but shudder!"Then a man approached who heard this conversation which the youth washolding with himself, and when they had walked a little further towhere they could see the gallows, the man said to him, "Look, there isthe tree where seven men have married the ropemaker's daughter, and arenow learning how to fly.  Sit down below it, and wait till night comes,and thou wilt soon learn how to shudder."  "If that is all that iswanted," answered the youth, "it is easily done; but if I learn how toshudder as quickly as that, thou shalt have my fifty thalers.  Justcome back to me early in the morning."  Then the youth went to thegallows, sat down below it, and waited till evening came.  And as hewas cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the wind blew sosharp that in spite of his fire he could not get warm.  And as the windknocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved backward andforward, he thought to himself: "Thou shiverest below by the fire, buthow those up above must freeze and suffer!"  And as he felt pity forthem, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them afterthe other, and brought down all seven.  Then he stirred the fire, blewit, and set them all round it to warm themselves.  But they sat thereand did not stir, and the fire caught their clothes.  So he said:"Take care, or I will hang you up again."  The dead men, however, didnot hear, but were quite silent, and let their rags go on burning.  Onthis he grew angry, and said: "If you will not take care, I cannot helpyou, I will not be burned with you, and he hung them up again each inhis turn.Then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep, and next morning the mancame to him and wanted to have the fifty thalers, and said: "Well, dostthou know how to shudder?"  "No," answered he, "how was I to get toknow?  Those fellows up there did not open their mouths, and were sostupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodiesget burned."  Then the man saw that he would not carry away the fiftythalers that day, and went away saying:"One of this kind has never come in my way before."The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter tohimself: "Ah, if I could but shudder!  Ah, if I could but shudder!"  Awagoner who was striding behind him heard that and asked: "Who artthou?"  "I don't know," answered the youth.  Then the wagoner asked:"From whence comest thou?"  "I know not."  "Who is thy father?"  "ThatI may not tell thee."  "What is it that thou art always mutteringbetween thy teeth?"  "Ah," replied the youth, "I do so wish I couldshudder, but no one can teach me how to do it."  "Give up thy foolishchatter," said the wagoner.  "Come go with me, I will see about a placefor thee."  The youth went with the wagoner, and in the evening theyarrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night.  Then at theentrance of the room the youth again said quite loudly, "If I could butshudder!  If I could but shudder!"  The host who heard that, laughedand said: "If that is your desire, there ought to be a good opportunityfor you here."  "Ah, be silent," said the hostess; "so many inquisitivepersons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and a shameif such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again."But the youth said: "However difficult it may be, I will learn it, andfor this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth."  He let the host haveno rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood ahaunted castle where any one could very easily learn what shudderingwas, if he would but watch in it for three nights.  The King hadpromised that he who would venture this should have his daughter towife, and she was the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on.  Greattreasures likewise lay in the castle, which were guarded by evilspirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and would make a poorman rich enough.  Already many men had gone into the castle, but as yetnone had come out again.  Then the youth went next morning to the King,and said that if he were allowed he would watch three nights in theenchanted castle.  The King looked at him, and as the youth pleasedhim, he said: "Thou mayst ask for three things to take into the castlewith thee, but they must be things without life."  Then he answered,"Then I ask for a fire, a turning-lathe, and a cutting-board with theknife."  The King had these things carried into the castle for himduring the day.  When night was drawing near, the youth went up andmade himself a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe."Ah, if I could but shudder!" said he, "but I shall not learn it hereeither."  Toward midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he wasblowing it, something cried suddenly from one cornier, "Au, miau!  howcold we are!"  "You simpletons!" cried he, "what are you crying about?If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves."And when he had said that, two great black cats came with onetremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked savagelyat him with their fiery eyes.  After a short time, when they had warmedthemselves, they said: "Comrade, shall we have a game at cards?"  "Whynot?" he replied, "but just show me your paws.  Then they stretched outtheir claws.  "Oh," said he, "what long nails you have!  Wait, I mustfirst cut them a little for you."  Thereupon he seized them by thethroats, put them on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast.  "Ihave looked at your fingers," said he, "and my fancy for card-playinghas gone, and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water.But when he had made away with these two, and was about to sit downagain by his fire, out from every hole and corner came black cats andblack dogs with red-hot chains, and more and more of them came until hecould no longer stir, and they yelled horribly, and got on his fire,pulled it to pieces, and wanted to put it out.  He watched them for awhile quietly, but at last when they were going too far, he seized hiscutting knife, and cried: "Away with ye, vermin," and began to cut themdown.  Part of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out intothe fish pond.  When he came back he blew up the embers of his fireagain and warmed himself.  And as he thus sat, his eyes would keep openno longer, and he felt a desire to sleep.  Then he looked round and sawa great bed in the corner.  "That is the very thing for me," said he,and got into it.  When he was just going to shut his eyes, however, thebed began to move of its own accord, and went over the whole of thecastle.  'That's right," said he, "but go faster."  Then the bed rolledon as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over thresholdsand steps, but suddenly, hop, hop, it turned over upside down, and layon him like a mountain.  But he threw quilts and pillows up in the air,got out and said: "Now any one who likes may drive," and lay down byhis fire, and slept until it was day.  In the morning the King came,and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the spiritshad killed him and he was dead.  Then said he: "After all it is a pity-he is a handsome man."  The youth heard it, got up, and said: "It hasnot come to that yet."  Then the King was astonished, but very glad,and asked how he had fared.  "Very well indeed," answered he; "onenight is over, the two others will get over likewise."  Then he went tothe innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: "I neverexpected to see thee alive again!  Hast thou learned how to shudderyet?"  "No," said he, "it is all in vain.  If some one would but tellme!"The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by thefire, and once more began his old song: "If I could but shudder!"  Whenmidnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; atfirst it was low, but it grew louder and louder.  Then it was quiet fora while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down thechimney and fell before him.  "Hollo!" cried he, "another half belongsto this.  This is too little!"  Then the uproar began again, there wasa roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise.  "Wait,"said he, "I will just blow up the fire a little for thee."  When he haddone that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together,and a frightful man was sitting in his place.  "That is no part of ourbargain," said the youth, "the bench is mine."  The man wanted to pushhim away; the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him offwith all his strength, and seated himself again, in his own place.Then still more men fell down, one after the other; they brought ninedead men's legs and two skulls, and set them up and played at ninepinswith them.  The youth also wanted to play and said: "Hark you, can Ijoin you?"  "Yes, if thou hast any money."  "Money enough," replied he,"but your balls are not quite round."  Then he took the skulls and putthem in the lathe and turned them till they were round.  "There, now,they will roll better!" said he.  "Hurrah!  now it goes merrily!"  Heplayed with them and lost some of his money, but when it struck twelve,everything vanished from his sight.  He lay down and quietly fellasleep.  Next morning the King came to inquire after him.  "How has itfared with thee this time?" asked he.  "I have been playing atninepins," he answered, "and have lost a couple of farthings."  "Hastthou not shuddered then?"  "Eh, what?" said he, "I have made merry.  IfI did but know what it was to shudder!"The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:"If I could but shudder."  When it grew late, six tall men came in andbrought a coffin.  Then said he: "Ha, ha, that is certainly my littlecousin, who only died a few days ago," and he beckoned with his finger,and cried: "Come, little cousin, come."  They placed the coffin on theground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man laytherein.  He felt his face, but it was cold as ice.  "Stop," said he,"I will warm thee a, little," and went to the fire and warmed his handand laid it on the dead man's face, but he remained cold.  Then he tookhim out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbedhis arms that the blood might circulate again.  As this also did nogood, he thought to himself: "When two people lie in bed together, theywarm each other," and carried him to bed, covered him over and lay downby him.  After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began tomove.  Then said the youth: "See, little cousin, have I not warmedthee?" The dead man, however, got up and cried, "Now will I stranglethee.""What!" said he, "is that the way thou thankest me?  Thou shalt at oncego into thy coffin again," and he took him up, threw him into it, andshut the lid.Then came the six men and carried him away again.  "I cannot manage toshudder," said he.  "I shall never learn it here as long as I live."Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.He was old, however, and had a long white beard.  "Thou wretch," criedhe, "thou shalt soon learn what it is to shudder, for thou shalt die.""Not so fast," replied the youth, "If I am to die, I shall have to havea say in it."  "I will soon seize thee," said the fiend.  "Softly,softly, do not talk so big.  I am as strong as thou art, and perhapseven stronger."  "We shall see," said the old man.  "If thou artstronger, I will let thee go-come, we will try."  Then he led him bydark passages to a smith's forge, took an ax, and with one blow struckan anvil into the ground.  "I can do that better still," said theyouth, and went to the other anvil.  The old man placed himself nearand wanted to look on, and his white heard hung down.  Then the youthseized the ax, split the anvil with one blow, and struck the old man'sbeard in with it.  "Now I have thee," said the youth.  "Now it is thouwho wilt have to die."  Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old mantill he moaned and entreated him to stop, and he would give him greatriches.  The youth drew out the ax and let him go.  The old man led himback into the castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full ofgold.  "Of these," said he, "one part is for the poor, the other is forthe king, the third is thine."  In the meantime it struck twelve, andthe spirit disappeared; the youth, therefore, was left in darkness.  "Ishall still be able to find my way out," said he, and felt about, foundthe way into the room, and slept there by his fire.  Next morning theKing came and said, "Now thou must have learned what shuddering is?""No," he answered; "what can it be?  My dead cousin was here, and abearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below, but noone told me what it was to shudder."  "Then," said the King, "thou hastdelivered the castle, and shalt marry my daughter."  "That is all verywell," said he, "but still I do not know what it is to shudder!"Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoevermuch the young King loved his wife, and however happy he was, he stillsaid always: "If I could but shudder-if I could but shudder."  And atlast she was angry at this.  Her waiting-maid said, "I will find a curefor him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder."  She went out tothe stream which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketfulof gudgeons brought to her.  At night when the young King was sleeping,his wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucketful ofcold water with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fisheswould sprawl about him.  When this was done, he woke up and cried: "Oh,what makes me shudder so?-what makes me shudder so, dear wife?  Ah! nowI know what it is to shudder!"AESOP'S FABLESThis has come to be the commonly accepted name for the well-knowncollection of stories about animals, though we cannot be sure that anyof them, were written by the Greek slave of that name, who, Herodotustells us, lived about the year 55O B.C.  The fable about animals isprobably the oldest form of story known.  Its object is to teach alesson to men and women, without seeming to do so, and because of thisconcealed lesson it has always been a great favorite with all nations.In Russia, for example, where a man did not dare say what he thoughtabout a Government officer, he could tell a fable about the Dog in theManger.THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSENOW you must know that a Town Mouse once upon a time went on a visit tohis cousin in the country.  He was rough and ready, this cousin, but heloved his town friend and made him heartily welcome.  Beans and bacon,cheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely.The Town Mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare, andsaid: "I cannot understand, Cousin, how you can put up with such poorfood as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in thecountry; come you with me and I will show you how to live.  When youhave been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stooda country life."  No sooner said than done: the two mice set off forthe town and arrived at the Town Mouse's residence late at night.  "Youwill want some refreshment after our long journey," said the politeTown Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining-room.  There theyfound the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating upjellies and cakes and all that was nice.  Suddenly they heard growlingand barking.  "What is that?" said the Country Mouse.  "It is only thedogs of the house," answered the other.  "Only!" said the CountryMouse.  "I do not like that music at my dinner."  Just at that momentthe door flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had toscamper down and run off.  "Good-by, Cousin," said the Country Mouse."What!  going so soon?" said .the other.  "Yes," he replied;"BETTER BEANS AND BACON IN PEACETHAN CAKES AND ALE IN FEAR."THE MAN, THE BOY, AND DONKEYA MAN and his son were once going with their Donkey to market.  As theywere walking along by its side a countryman passed them and said: "Youfools, what is a Donkey for but to ride upon?"So the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way.  Butsoon they passed a group of men, one of whom said: "See that lazyyoungster, he lets his father walk while he rides."So the Man ordered his Boy to get off, and got on himself.  But theyhadn't gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said to theother: "Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudgealong."Well, the Man didn't know what to do, but at last he took his Boy upbefore him on the Donkey.  By this time they had come to the town, andthe passers-by began to jeer and point to them.  The Man stopped andasked what they were scoffing at.  The men said: "Aren't you ashamed ofyourself for overloading that poor Donkey of yours-you and your hulkingson?"The Man and Boy got off and tried to think what to do.  They thoughtand they thought, till at last they cut down a pole, tied the Donkey'sfeet to it, and raised the pole and the Donkey to their shoulders.They went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came toMarket Bridge, when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kickedout and caused the Boy to drop his end of the pole.  In the strugglethe Donkey fell over the bridge, and his fore-feet being tied togetherhe was drowned."That will teach you," said an old man who had followed them:"PLEASE ALL, AND YOU WILL PLEASENONE."THE SHEPHERD'S BOYTHERE was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot ofa mountainnear a dark forest.  It was rather lonely for him all day, so hethought upon a plan by which he could get a little company and someexcitement.  He rushed down toward the village calling out "Wolf,'Wolf," and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of themstopped with him for a considerable time.This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterward he tried thesame trick, and again the villagers came to his help.But shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out from the forest,and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out "Wolf,Wolf," still louder than before.  But this time the villagers who hadbeen fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, andnobody stirred to come to bis help.So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy's flock, and when the boycomplained, the wise man of the village said:"A LIAR WILL NOT BE BELIEVED, EVENWHEN HE SPEAKS THE TRUTH."ANDROCLESA SLAVE named Androcles once escaped from his master and fled to theforest.  As he was wandering about there he came upon a Lion lying downmoaning and groaning.At first he turned to flee, but finding that the Lion did not pursuehim, he turned back and went up to him.As he came near, the Lion put out his paw, which was all swollen andbleeding, and Androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it, andwas causing all the pain.  He pulled out the thorn and bound up the pawof the Lion, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcleslike a dog.Then the Lion took Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bringhim meat from which to live.But shortly afterward both Androcles and the Lion were captured, andthe slave was sentenced to be thrown to the Lion, after the latter hadbeen kept without food for several days.  The Emperor and all his Courtcame to see the spectacle and Androcles was led out into the middle ofthe arena.  Soon the Lion was let loose from his den, and rushedbounding and roaring toward his victim.  But as soon as he came near toAndrocles he recognized his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked hishands like a friendly dog.  The Emperor, surprised at this, summonedAndrocles to him, who told him the whole story.  Whereupon the slavewas pardoned and freed, and the Lion let loose to his native forest."GRATITUDE IS THE SIGN OF NOBLE SOULS."THE FOX AND THE STORKAT one time the Fox and the Stork were on visiting terms and seemedvery good friends.  So the Fox invited the Stork to dinner, and for ajoke put nothing before her but some soup in a very shallow dish.  Thisthe Fox could easily lap up, but the Stork could only wet the end ofher long bill in it, and left the meal as hungry as when she began."I am sorry," said the Fox, "the soup is not to your liking.""Pray do not apologize," said the Stork.  "I hope you will return thisvisit, and come and dine with me soon."So a day was appointed when the Fox should visit the Stork; but whenthey were seated at table all that was for their dinner was containedin a very long-necked jar with a narrow mouth, in which the Fox couldnot insert his snout, so all he could manage to do was to lick theoutside of the jar."I will not apologize for the dinner," said the Stork:"ONE BAD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER."THE CROW AND THE PITCHERA CROW, half-dead with thirst, came upon a Pitcher which had once beenfull of water; but when the Crow put its beak into the mouth of thePitcher he found that only very little water was left in it, and thathe could not reach far enough down to get at it.He tried, and he tried, but at last had to give up in despair.Then a thought came to him, and he took a pebble and dropped it intothe Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped it into thePitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into thePitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into thePitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into thePitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into thePitcher.At last, at last, he saw the water mount up near him; and after castingin a few more pebbles he was able to quench his thirst and save hislife."LITTLE BY LITTLE DOES THE TRICK."THE FROGS DESIRING A KINGTHE Frogs were living as happy as could be in a marshy swamp that justsuited them; they went splashing about caring for nobody and nobodytroubling with them.  But some of them thought that this was not right,that they should have a King and a proper constitution, so theydetermined to send up a petition to Jove to give them what they wanted."Mighty Jove," they cried, "send unto us a King that will rule over usand keep us in order."  Jove laughed at their croaking, and threw downinto the swamp a huge Log, which came down-kerplash-into the swamp.The Frogs were frightened out of their lives by the commotion made intheir midst, and all rushed to the bank to look at the horriblemonster; but after a time, seeing that it did not move, one or two ofthe boldest of them ventured out toward the Log, and even dared totouch it; still it did not move.  Then the greatest hero of the Frogsjumped upon the Log and commenced dancing up and down upon it,thereupon all the Frogs came and did the same; and for sometime theFrogs went about their business every day without taking the slightestnotice of the new King Log lying in their midst.But this did not suit them, so they sent another petition to Jove, andsaid to him: "We want a real King; one that will really rule over us."Now this made Jove angry, so he sent among them a big Stork that soonset to work gobbling them all up.  Then the Frogs repented when toolate."BETTER NO RULE THAN CRUEL RULE."THE FROG AND THE OX"OH, FATHER," said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the side ofa pool, "I have seen such a terrible monster!  It was as big as amountain, with horns on its head, and a long tail, and it had hoofsdivided in two.""Tush, child, tush," said the old Frog, "that was only Farmer White'sOx.  It isn't so big either; he may be a little bit taller than I, butI could easily make myself quite as broad; just you see." So he blewhimself out, and blew himself out, and blew himself out.  "Was he asbig as that?" asked he."Oh, much bigger than that," said the young Frog.Again the old one blew himself out, and asked the young one if the Oxwas as big as that."Bigger, father, bigger," was the reply.So the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew and blew, and swelledand swelled and swelled.  And then he said: "I'm sure the Ox is not asbig as ______"  But at this moment he burst."SELF-CONCEIT MAY LEAD TO SELF-DESTRUCTION."THE COCK AND THE PEARLA COCK was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens whensuddenly he espied something shining and the straw.  "Ho! ho!" quothhe, "that's for me," and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw.What did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had beenlost in the yard?  "You may be a treasure," quoth Master Cock, "to menthat prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley cornthan a peck of pearls.""PRECIOUS THINGS ARE FOR THOSE THAT CAN PRIZE THEM."THE FOX WITHOUT A TAILIT happened that a Fox caught its tail in a trap, and in struggling torelease himself lost all of it but the stump.  At first he was ashamedto show himself among his fellow foxes.  But at last he determined toput a bolder face upon his misfortune, and summoned all the foxes to ageneral meeting to consider a proposal which he had to place beforethem.When they had assembled together the Fox proposed that they should alldo away with their tails.  He pointed out how inconvenient a tail waswhen they were pursued by their enemies, the dogs; how much it was inthe way when they desired to sit down and hold a friendly conversationwith one another.  He failed to see any advantage in carrying aboutsuch a useless encumbrance."That is all very well," said one of the older foxes; "but I do notthink you would have recommended us to dispense with our chief ornamentif you had not happened to lose it yourself.""DISTRUST INTERESTED ADVICE."THE FOX AND THE CATA FOX was boasting to a Cat of its clever devices for escaping itsenemies.  "I have a whole bag of tricks," he said, "which contains ahundred ways of escaping my enemies.""I have only one," said the Cat; "but I can generally manage withthat."  Just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of houndscoming toward them, and the Cat immediately scampered up a tree and hidherself in the boughs.  "This is my plan," said the Cat.  "What are yougoing to do?"  The Fox thought first of one way, then of another, andwhile he was debating the hounds came nearer and nearer, and at lastthe Fox in his confusion was caught up by the hounds and soon killed bythe huntsmen.  Miss Puss, who had been looking on, said:"BETTER ONE SAFE WAY THAN A HUNDREDON WHICH YOU CANNOTRECKON."THE DOG IN THE MANGERA DOG looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the Manger of an Oxand lay there cosily upon the straw.  But soon the Ox, returning fromits afternoon work, came up to the Manger and wanted to eat some of thestraw.  The Dog in a rage, being awakened from its slumber, stood upand barked at the Ox, and whenever it came near attempted to bite it.At last the Ox had to give up the hope of getting at the straw, andwent away muttering:"AH, PEOPLE OFTEN GRUDGE OTHERSWHAT THEY CANNOT ENJOYTHEMSELVES."THE FOX AND THE GOATBy an unlucky chance a Fox fell into a deep well from which he couldnot get out.  A Goat passed by shortly afterward, and asked the Foxwhat he was doing down there.  "Oh, have you not heard?" said the Fox;"there is going to be a great drought, so I jumped down here in orderto be sure to have water by me.  Why don't you come down, too?"  TheGoat thought well of this advice, and jumped down into the well.  Butthe Fox immediately jumped on her back, and by putting his foot on herlong horns managed to jump up to the edge of the well.  "Good-by,friend," said the Fox ;-"remember next time,"NEVER TRUST THE ADVICE OF A MANIN DIFFICULTIES."BELLING THE CATLONG ago, the mice held a general council to consider what measuresthey could take to outwit their common enemy, the Cat.  Some said this,and some said that; but at last a young mouse got up and said he had aproposal to make, which he thought would meet the case.  "You will allagree," said he, "that our chief danger consists in the sly andtreacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us.  Now, if we couldreceive some signal of her approach, we could easily escape from her.I venture, therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, andattached by a ribbon round the neck of the Cat.  By this means weshould always know when she was about, and could easily retire whileshe was in the neighborhood."This proposed met with general applause, until an old mouse got up andsaid: "That is all very well, but who is to bell the Cat?"  The micelooked at one another and nobody spoke.  Then the old mouse said:"IT IS EASY TO PROPOSE IMPOSSIBLEREMEDIES."THE JAY AND THE PEACOCKA JAY venturing into a yard where Peacocks used to walk, found there anumber of feathers which had fallen from the Peacocks when they weremoulting.  He tied them all to his tail and strutted down toward thePeacocks.  When he came near them they soon discovered the cheat, andstriding up to him pecked at him and plucked away his borrowed plumes.So the Jay could do no better than go back to the other Jays, who hadwatched his behavior from a distance; but they were equally annoyedwith him, and told him"IT IS NOT ONLY FINE FEATHERS THATMAKE FINE BIRDS."THE ASS AND THE LAP-DOGA FARMER one day came to the stables to see to his beasts of burden:among them was his favorite Ass, that was always well fed and oftencarried his master.  With the Farmer came his Lap-dog, who danced aboutand licked his hand and frisked about as happy as could be.  The Farmerfelt in his pocket, gave the Lap-dog some dainty food, and sat downwhile he gave his orders to his servants.  The Lap-dog jumped into hismaster's lap, and lay there blinking while the Farmer stroked his ears.The Ass, seeing this, broke loose from his halter and commencedprancing about in imitation of the Lap-dog.  The Farmer could not holdhis sides with laughter, so the Ass went up to him, and putting hisfeet upon the Farmer's shoulder attempted to climb into his lap.  TheFarmer's servants rushed up with sticks and pitchforks and soon taughtthe Ass that"CLUMSY JESTING IS NO JOKE."THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPERIN a field one summer's day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirpingand singing to its heart's content.  An Ant passed by, bearing alongwith great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest."Why not come and chat with me," said the Grasshopper, "instead oftoiling and moiling in that way?""I am helping to lay up food for the winter," said the Ant, "andrecommend you to do the same.""Why bother about winter?"  said the Grasshopper; "we have got plentyof food at present."But the Ant went on its way and continued its toil.Then the winter came the Grasshopper had no food, and found itselfdying of hunger, while it saw the ants distributing every day corn andgrain from the stores they had collected in the summer.  Then theGrasshopper knewIT IS BEST TO PREPARE FOR THE DAYSOF NECESSITY.THE WOODMAN AND THE SERPENTONE wintry day a Woodman was tramping home from his work when he sawsomething black lying on the snow.  When he came closer, he saw it wasa Serpent to all appearance dead.  But he took it up and put it in hisbosom to warm while he hurried home.  As soon as he got indoors he putthe Serpent down on the hearth before the fire.  The children watchedit and saw it slowly come to life again.  Then one of them stooped downto stroke it, but the Serpent raised its head and put out its fangs andwas about to sting the child to death.  So the Woodman seized his axe,and with one stroke cut the Serpent in two.  "Ah," said he,"NO GRATITUDE FROM THE WICKED."THE MILKMAID AND HER PAILPATTY, the Milkmaid, was going to market carrying her milk in a Pail onher head.  As she went along she began calculating what she would dowith the money she would get for the milk.  "I'll buy some fowls fromFarmer Brown," said she, "and they will lay eggs each morning, which Iwill sell to the parson's wife.  With the money that I get from thesale of these eggs I'll buy myself a new dimity frock and a chip hat;and when I go to market, won't all the young men come up and speak tome!  Polly Shaw will be that jealous; but I don't care.  I shall justlook at her and toss my head like this."  As she spoke, she tossed herhead back, the Pail fell off it and all the milk was spilt.  So she hadto go home and tell her mother what had occurred."Ah, my child," said her mother,DO NOT COUNT YOUR CHICKENS BEFORETHEY ARE HATCHED.THE LION AND THE MOUSEONCE when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and downupon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him,and opened his big jaws to swallow him.  "Pardon, O King," cried thelittle Mouse; "forgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knowsbut what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?"  The Lionwas so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that helifted up his paw and let him go.  Some time after the Lion was caughtin a trap, and the hunters, who desired to carry him alive to the King,tied him to a tree while they went in search of a wagon to carry himon.  Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sadplight in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away theropes that bound the King of the Beasts.  "Was I not right?" said thelittle Mouse."LITTLE FRIENDS MAY PROVE GREATFRIENDS."HERCULES AND THE WAGONERA WAGONER was once driving a heavy load along a very muddy way.  Atlast he came to a part of the road where the wheels sank halfway intothe mire, and the more the horses pulled, the deeper sank the wheels.So the Wagoner threw down his whip, and knelt down and prayed toHercules the Strong.  "O Hercules, help me in this my hour ofdistress," quote he.  But Hercules appeared to him, and said:"Tut, man, don't sprawl there.  Get up and put your shoulder to thewheel.""THE GODS HELP THEM THAT HELPTHEMSELVES."THE LION'S SHARETHE Lion went once a-hunting along with the Fox, the Jackal, and theWolf.  They hunted and they hunted till at last they surprised a Stag,and soon took its life.  Then came the question how the spoil should bedivided.  "Quarter me this Stag," roared the Lion; so the other animalsskinned it and cut it into four parts.  Then the Lion took his stand infront of the carcass and pronounced judgment: "The first quarter is forme in my capacity as King of Beasts; the second is mine as arbiter;another share comes to me for my part in the chase; and as far thefourth quarter, well, as for that, I should like to see which of youwill dare to lay a paw upon it.""Humph !" grumbled the Fox as he walked away with his tail between hislegs; but he spoke in a low growl-"YOU MAY SHARE THE LABORS OF THEGREAT, BUT YOU WILL NOT SHARETHE SPOIL."THE FOX AND THE CROWA FOX once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak andsettle on a branch of a tree.  "That's for me, as I am a Fox," saidMaster Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the tree.  "Good-day,Mistress Crow," he cried.  "How well you are looking to-day: how glossyyour feathers; how bright your eye.  I feel sure your voice mustsurpass that of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear butone song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds."  TheCrow lifted up her head and began to caw her best, but the moment sheopened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground, only to besnapped up by Master Fox.  "That will do," said he.  "That was all Iwanted.  In exchange for your cheese I will give you a piece of advicefor the future-"DO NOT TRUST FLATTERERS.THE DOG AND THE SHADOWIT happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it homein his mouth to eat it in peace.  Now on his way home he had to cross aplank lying across a running brook.  As he crossed, he looked down andsaw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath.  Thinking it wasanother dog with another piece of meat, he made up his mind to havethat also.  So he made a snap at the shadow in the water, but as heopened his mouth the piece of meat fell out, dropped into the water andwas never seen more."BEWARE LEST YOU LOSE THE SUBSTANCEBY GRASPING AT THE SHADOW."THE WOLF AND THE LAMBONCE upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside, when,looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to drink alittle lower down.  "There's my supper," thought he, "if only I canfind some excuse to seize it."  Then he called out to the Lamb, "Howdare you muddle the water from which I am drinking?""Nay, master, nay," said Lambikin; "if the water be muddy up there, Icannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to me.""Well, then," said the Wolf, "why did you call me bad names this timelast year?""That cannot be," said the Lamb; "I am only six months old.""I don't care," snarled the Wolf; "if it was not you it was yourfather;" and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb and-WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA-ate her all up.  But before- she died she gasped out-"ANY EXCUSE WILL SERVE A TYRANT."THE BAT, THE BIRDS, AND THE BEASTSA GREAT conflict was about to come off between the Birds and theBeasts.  When the two armies were collected together the Bat hesitatedwhich to join.  The Birds that passed his perch said: "Come with us;"but he said: "I am a Beast."  Later on, some Beasts who were passingunderneath him looked up and said: "Come with us;" but he said: "I am aBird."  Luckily at the last moment peace was made, and no battle tookplace, so the Bat came to the Birds and wished to join in therejoicings, but they all turned against him and he had to fly away.  Hethen went to the Beasts, but soon had to beat a retreat, or else theywould have torn him to pieces.  "Ah," said the Bat, "I see nowHE THAT IS NEITHER ONE THING NORTHE OTHER HAS NO FRIENDS."THE BELLY AND THE MEMBERSONE fine day it occurred to the Members of the Body that they weredoing all the work and the Belly was having all the food.  So they helda meeting, and after a long discussion, decided to strike work till theBelly consented to take its proper share of the work.  So for a day ortwo the Hands refused to take the food, the Mouth refused to receiveit, and the Teeth had no work to do.  But after a day or two theMembers began to find that they themselves were not in a very activecondition: the Hands could hardly move, and the Mouth was all parchedand dry, while the Legs were unable to support the rest.  So thus theyfound that even the Belly in its dull quiet way was doing necessarywork for the Body, and that all must work together or the Body will goto pieces.THE FOX AND THE GRAPESONE hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till hecame to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had beentrained over a lofty branch.  "Just the thing to quench my thirst,"quoth he.  Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and justmissed the bunch.  Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, hejumped up, but with no greater success.  Again and again he tried afterthe tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked awaywith his nose in the air, saying: "I am sure they are sour.""IT IS EASY TO DESPISE WHAT YOUCANNOT GET."THE SWALLOW AND THE OTHER BIRDSIT happened that a Countryman was sowing some hemp seed in a fieldwhere a Swallow and some other birds were hopping about picking uptheir food.  "Beware of that man," quoth the Swallow.  "Why, what is hedoing?" said the others.  "That is hemp seed he is sowing; be carefulto pick up every one of the seeds, or else you will repent it."  Thebirds paid no heed to the Swallow's words, and by and by the hemp grewup and was made into cord, and of the cords nets were made, and many abird that had despised the Swallow's advice was caught in nets made outof that very hemp.  "What did I tell you?" said the Swallow."DESTROY THE SEED OF EVIL, OR ITWILL GROW UP TO YOUR RUIN."This etext was produced by Douglas E. Levy.TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:  "Sunrise" is an elegy to James A.

EMMA LAZARUS. (Written for "The Century Magazine")             Born July 22, 1849; Died November 19, 1887.One hesitates to lift the veil and throw the light upon a life sohidden and a personality so withdrawn as that of Emma Lazarus; butwhile her memory is fresh, and the echo of her songs still lingersin these pages, we feel it a duty to call up her presence once more,and to note the traits that made it remarkable and worthy to shineout clearly before the world.  Of dramatic episode or climax in herlife there is none; outwardly all was placid and serene, like anuntroubled stream whose depths alone hold the strong, quick tide.The story of her life is the story of a mind, of a spirit, everseeking, ever striving, and pressing onward and upward to new truthand light.  Her works are the mirror of this progress.  In reviewingthem, the first point that strikes us is the precocity, or ratherthe spontaneity, of her poetic gift.  She was a born singer; poetrywas her natural language, and to write was less effort than to speak,for she was a shy, sensitive child, with strange reserves andreticences, not easily putting herself "en rapport" with those aroundher.  Books were her world from her earliest years; in them sheliterally lost and found herself.  She was eleven years old when theWar of Succession broke out, which inspired her first lyric outbursts.Her poems and translations written between the ages of fourteen andseventeen were collected, and constituted her first published volume.Crude and immature as these productions naturally were, and utterlycondemned by the writer's later judgment, they are, nevertheless,highly interesting and characteristic, giving, as they do, thekeynote of much that afterwards unfolded itself in her life.  Onecannot fail to be rather painfully impressed by the profoundmelancholy pervading the book.  The opening poem is "In Memoriam,"--on the death of a school friend and companion; and the two followingpoems also have death for theme.  "On a Lock of my Mother's Hair"givesus reflections on growing old.  These are the four poems written atthe age of fourteen.  There is not a wholly glad and joyous strain inthe volume, and we might smile at the recurrence of broken vows,broken hearts, and broken lives in the experience of this maiden justentered upon her teens, were it not that the innocent child herselfis in such deadly earnest.  The two long narrative poems, "Bertha" and"Elfrida," are tragic in the extreme.  Both are dashed off apparentlyat white heat: "Elfrida," over fifteen hundred lines of blank verse,in two weeks; "Bertha," in three and a half.  We have said that EmmaLazarus was a born singer, but she did not sing, like a bird, forjoy of being alive; and of being young, alas! there is no hint inthese youthful effusions, except inasmuch as this unrelieved gloom,this ignorance of "values," so to speak, is a sign of youth, commonespecially among gifted persons of acute and premature sensibilities,whose imagination, not yet focused by reality, overreached the mark.With Emma Lazarus, however, this sombre streak has a deeper root;something of birth and temperament is in it--the stamp and heritageof a race born to suffer.  But dominant and fundamental though it was,Hebraism was only latent thus far.  It was classic and romantic artthat first attracted and inspired her.  She pictures Aphrodite thebeautiful, arising from the waves, and the beautiful Apollo and hisloves,--Daphne, pursued by the god, changing into the laurel, and theenamored Clytie into the faithful sunflower.  Beauty, for its ownsake, supreme and unconditional, charmed her primarily and to the end.Her restless spirit found repose in the pagan idea,--the absoluteunity and identity of man with nature, as symbolized in the Greekmyths, where every natural force becomes a person, and where, in turn,persons pass with equal readiness and freedom back into nature again.In this connection a name would suggest itself even if it did notappear,--Heine, the Greek, Heine the Jew, Heine the Romanticist, asEmma Lazarus herself has styled him; and already in this early volumeof hers we have trace of the kinship and affinity that afterwards soplainly declared itself.  Foremost among the translations are anumber of his songs, rendered with a finesse and a literalness thatare rarely combined.  Four years later, at the age of twenty-one,she published her second volume, "Admetus and Other Poems," whichat once took rank as literature both in America and England, andchallenged comparison with the work of established writers.  Ofclassic themes we have "Admetus" and "Orpheus," and of romantic thelegend of Tannhauser and of the saintly Lohengrin.  All are treatedwith an artistic finish that shows perfect mastery of her craft,without detracting from the freshness and flow of her inspiration.While sounding no absolutely new note in the world, she yet makesus aware of a talent of unusual distinction, and a highly endowednature,--a sort of tact of sentiment and expression, an instinctof the true and beautiful, and that quick intuition which is likesecond-sight in its sensitiveness to apprehend and respond to externalstimulus.  But it is not the purely imaginative poems in this volumethat most deeply interest us.  We come upon experience of life inthese pages; not in the ordinary sense, however, of outward activityand movement, but in the hidden undercurrent of being.  "The epochsof our life are not in the visible facts, but in the silent thoughtsby the wayside as we walk."  This is the motto, drawn from Emerson,which she chooses for her poem of "Epochs," which marks a pivotalmoment in her life.  Difficult to analyze, difficult above all toconvey, if we would not encroach upon the domain of private andpersonal experience, is the drift of this poem, or rather cycle ofpoems, that ring throughout with a deeper accent and a more directappeal than has yet made itself felt.  It is the drama of the humansoul,--"the mystic winged and flickering butterfly," "flittingbetween earth and sky," in its passage from birth to death.A golden morning of June!  "Sweet empty sky without a stain."Sunlight and mist and "ripple of rain-fed rills."  "A murmur and asinging manifold."            "What simple things be these the soul to raise             To bounding joy, and make young pulses beat             With nameless pleasure, finding life so sweet!"Such is youth, a June day, fair and fresh and tender with dreams andlonging and vague desire. The morn lingers and passes, but the noonhas not reached its height before the clouds begin to rise, thesunshine dies, the air grows thick and heavy, the lightnings flash,the thunder breaks among the hills, rolls and gathers and grows,until                   Behold, yon bolt struck home,             And over ruined fields the storm hath come."Now we have the phases of the soul,--the shock and surprise of griefin the face of the world made desolate.  Loneliness and despair fora space, and then, like stars in the night, the new births of thespirit, the wonderful outcoming from sorrow: the mild light ofpatienceat first; hope and faith kindled afresh in the very jaws of evil;the new meaning and worth of life beyond sorrow, beyond joy; andfinally duty, the holiest word of all, that leads at last to victoryand peace.  The poem rounds and completes itself with the close of"the long, rich day," and the release of           "The mystic winged and flickering butterfly,            A human soul, that drifts at liberty,            Ah! who can tell to what strange paradise,            To what undreamed-of fields and lofty skies!"We have dwelt at some length upon this poem, which seems to us, in acertain sense, subjective and biographical; but upon closer analysisthere is still another conclusion to arrive at.  In "Epochs" we have,doubtless, the impress of a calamity brought very near to the writer,and profoundly working upon her sensibilities; not however by direct,but reflex action, as it were, and through sympathetic emotion--theemotion of the deeply-stirred spectator, of the artist, the poet wholives in the lives of others, and makes their joys and their sorrowshis own.Before dismissing this volume we may point out another clue as to theshaping of mind and character.  The poem of "Admetus" is dedicated"to my friend Ralph Waldo Emerson."  Emma Lazarus was betweenseventeen and eighteen years of age when the writings of Emersonfell into her hands, and it would be difficult to over-estimate theimpression produced upon her.  As she afterwards wrote: "To how manythousand youthful hearts has not his word been the beacon--nay,more, the guiding star--that led them safely through periods ofmental storm and struggle!"  Of no one is this more true than herself.Left, to a certain extent, without compass or guide, without anypositive or effective religious training, this was the first greatmoral revelation of her life.  We can easily realize the chaos andferment of an over-stimulated brain, steeped in romantic literature,and given over to the wayward leadings of the imagination.  Who cantell what is true, what is false, in a world where fantasy is as realas fact?  Emerson's word fell like truth itself, "a shaft of lightshot from the zenith," a golden rule of thought and action.  Hisbooks were bread and wine to her, and she absorbed them into hervery being.  She felt herself invincibly drawn to the master, "thatfount of wisdom and goodness," and it was her great privilege duringthese years to be brought into personal relations with him.  Fromthe first he showed her a marked interest and sympathy, which becamefor her one of the most valued possessions of her life.  He criticisedher work with the fine appreciation and discrimination that madehim quick to discern the quality of her talent as well as of herpersonality, and he was no doubt attracted by her almost transparentsincerity and singleness of soul, as well as by the simplicity andmodesty that would have been unusual even in a person not gifted.He constituted himself, in a way, her literary mentor, advised heras to the books she should read and the attitude of mind she shouldcultivate.  For some years he corresponded with her very faithfully;his letters are full of noble and characteristic utterances, andgive evidence of a warm regard that in itself was a stimulus and ahigh incentive.  But encouragement even from so illustrious a sourcefailed to elate the young poetess, or even to give her a due senseof the importance and value of her work, or the dignity of hervocation.  We have already alluded to her modesty in her unwillingnessto assert herself or claim any prerogative,--something even morbidand exaggerated, which we know not how to define, whether as over-sensitiveness or indifference.  Once finished, the heat and glow ofcomposition spent, her writings apparently ceased to interest her.She often resented any allusion to them on the part of intimatefriends, and the public verdict as to their excellence could notreassure or satisfy her.  The explanation is not far, perhaps, toseek.  Was it not the "Ewig-Weibliche" that allows no prestige butits own?  Emma Lazarus was a true woman, too distinctly feminine towish to be exceptional, or to stand alone and apart, even by virtueof superiority.A word now as to her life and surroundings.  She was one of a familyof seven, and her parents were both living.  Her winters were passedin New York, and her summers by the sea.  In both places her life wasessentially quiet and retired.  The success of her book had beenmainly in the world of letters.  In no wise tricked out to catch thepublic eye, her writings had not yet made her a conspicuous figure,but were destined slowly to take their proper place and give her therank that she afterwards held.For some years now almost everything that she wrote was publishedin "Lippincott's Magazine," then edited by John Foster Kirk, and weshall still find in her poems the method and movement of her life.Nature is still the fount and mirror, reflecting, and again reflected,in the soul.  We have picture after picture, almost to satiety,until we grow conscious of a lack of substance and body and of vitalplay to the thought, as though the brain were spending itself indreamings and reverie, the heart feeding upon itself, and the lifechoked by its own fullness without due outlet.  Happily, however,the heavy cloud of sadness has lifted, and we feel the subsidenceof waves after a storm.  She sings "Matins:"--                  "Does not the morn break thus,                   Swift, bright, victorious,                   With new skies cleared for us                   Over the soul storm-tost?                   Her night was long and deep,                   Strange visions vexed her sleep,                   Strange sorrows bade her weep,                   Her faith in dawn was lost.                  "No halt, no rest for her,                   The immortal wanderer                   From sphere to higher sphere                   Toward the pure source of day.                   The new light shames her fears,                   Her faithlessness and tears,                   As the new sun appears                   To light her god-like way."Nature is the perpetual resource and consolation. "'T is good to bealive!" she says, and why?  Simply,                            "To see the light            That plays upon the grass, to feel (and sigh            With perfect pleasure) the mild breeze stir              Among the garden roses, red and white,                With whiffs of fragrancy."She gives us the breath of the pines and of the cool, salt seas,"illimitably sparkling."  Her ears drink the ripple of the tide,and she stops        "To gaze as one who is not satisfied         With gazing at the large, bright, breathing sea.""Phantasies" (after Robert Schumann) is the most complete and perfectpoem of this period.  Like "Epochs," it is a cycle of poems, and theverse has caught the very trick of music,--alluring, baffling, andevasive.  This time we have the landscape of the night, the glamourof moon and stars,--pictures half real and half unreal, mysticimaginings, fancies, dreams, and the enchantment of "faerie," andthroughout the unanswered cry, the eternal "Wherefore" of destiny.Dawn ends the song with a fine clear note, the return of day, night'smisty phantoms rolled away, and the world itself, again green,sparkling and breathing freshness.In 1874 she published "Alide," a romance in prose drawn from Goethe'sautobiography.  It may be of interest to quote the letter shereceived from Tourgeneff on this occasion:--    "Although, generally speaking, I do not think it advisable    to take celebrated men, especially poets and artists, as a    subject for a novel, still I am truly glad to say that I    have read your book with the liveliest interest.  It is    very sincere and very poetical at the same time; the life    and spirit of Germany have no secrets for you, and your    characters are drawn with a pencil as delicate as it is    strong.  I feel very proud of the approbation you give to    my works, and of the influence you kindly attribute to them    on your own talent; an author who write as you do is not    a pupil in art any more; he is not far from being himself    a master."Charming and graceful words, of which the young writer was justlyproud.About this time occurred the death of her mother, the first break inthe home and family circle.  In August of 1876 she made a visit toConcord, at the Emersons', memorable enough for her to keep a journaland note down every incident and detail.  Very touching to read now,in its almost childlike simplicity, is this record of "persons thatpass and shadows that remain."  Mr. Emerson himself meets her at thestation, and drives with her in his little one-horse wagon to hishome, the gray square house, with dark green blinds, set amidst nobletrees.  A glimpse of the family,--"the stately, white-haired Mrs.Emerson, and the beautiful, faithful Ellen, whose figure seems alwaysto stand by the side of her august father."  Then the picture ofConcord itself, lovely and smiling, with its quiet meadows, quietslopes, and quietest of rivers.  She meets the little set of Concordpeople: Mr. Alcott, for whom she does not share Mr. Emerson'senthusiasm; and William Ellery Channing, whose figure stands out likea gnarled and twisted scrub-oak,--a pathetic, impossible creature,whose cranks and oddities were submitted to on account of an innatenobility of character.  "Generally crabbed and reticent withstrangers, he took a liking to me," says Emma Lazarus.  "The bondof our sympathy was my admiration for Thoreau, whose memory heactually worships, having been his constant companion in his bestdays, and his daily attendant in the last years of illness and heroicsuffering.  I do not know whether I was most touched by the thoughtof the unique, lofty character that had inspired this depth andfervor of friendship, or by the pathetic constancy and pure affectionof the poor, desolate old man before me, who tried to conceal histenderness and sense of irremediable loss by a show of gruffness andphilosophy.  He never speaks of Thoreau's death," she says, "butalways 'Thoreau's loss,' or 'when I lost Mr. Thoreau,' or 'when Mr.Thoreau went away from Concord;' nor would he confess that he missedhim, for there was not a day, an hour, a moment, when he did notfeel that his friend was still with him and had never left him.  Andyet a day or two after," she goes on to say, "when I sat with him inthe sunlit wood, looking at the gorgeous blue and silver summer sky,he turned to me and said: 'Just half of the world died for me when Ilost Mr. Thoreau.  None of it looks the same as when I looked at itwith him.'. . . He took me through the woods and pointed out to meevery spot visited and described by his friend.  Where the hut stoodis a little pile of stones, and a sign, 'Site of Thoreau's Hut,' anda few steps beyond is the pond with thickly-wooded shore,--everythingexquisitely peaceful and beautiful in the afternoon light, and nota sound to be heard except the crickets or the 'z-ing' of the locustswhich Thoreau has described.  Farther on he pointed out to me, inthe distant landscape, a low roof, the only one visible, which wasthe roof of Thoreau's birthplace.  He had been over there many times,he said, since he lost Mr. Thoreau, but had never gone in,--he wasafraid it might look lonely!  But he had often sat on a rock infront of the house and looked at it."  On parting from his youngfriend, Mr. Channing gave her a package, which proved to be a copyof his own book on Thoreau, and the pocket compass which Thoreaucarried to the Maine woods and on all his excursions.  Before leavingthe Emersons she received the proof-sheets of her drama of "TheSpagnoletto," which was being printed for private circulation.  Sheshowed them to Mr. Emerson, who had expressed a wish to see them,and, after reading them, he gave them back to her with the commentthat they were "good."  She playfully asked him if he would not giveher a bigger word to take home to the family.  He laughed, and saidhe did not know of any; but he went on to tell her that he hadtaken it up, not expecting to read it through, and had not been ableto put it down.  Every word and line told of richness in the poetry,he said, and as far as he could judge the play had great dramaticopportunities.  Early in the autumn "The Spagnoletto" appeared,--atragedy in five acts, the scene laid in Italy, 1655.Without a doubt, every one in these days will take up with misgiving,and like Mr. Emerson "not expecting to read it through," a five-acttragedy of the seventeenth century, so far removed apparently fromthe age and present actualities,--so opposed to the "Modernite,"which has come to be the last word of art.  Moreover, great names atonce appear; great shades arise to rebuke the presumptuous new-comerin this highest realm of expression.  "The Spagnoletto" has gravedefects that would probably preclude its ever being represented onthe stage.  The denoument especially is unfortunate, and sins againstour moral and aesthetic instinct.  The wretched, tiger-like fatherstabs himself in the presence of his crushed and erring daughter, sothat she may forever be haunted by the horror and the retribution ofhis death.  We are left suspended, as it were, over an abyss, ourmoral judgment thwarted, our humanity outraged.  But "The Spagnoletto"is, nevertheless, a remarkable production, and pitched in anotherkey from anything the writer has yet given us.  Heretofore we haveonly had quiet, reflective, passive emotion: now we have a stormand sweep of passion for which we were quite unprepared. Ribera'scharacter is charged like a thunder-cloud with dramatic elements.Maria Rosa is the child of her father, fired at a flash, "deaf, dumb,and blind" at the touch of passion.              "Does love steal gently o'er our soul?"she asks;                        "What if he come,                 A cloud, a fire, a whirlwind?"and then the cry:                           "O my God!            This awful joy in mine own heart is love."Again:           "While you are here the one thing real to me            In all the universe is love."Exquisitely tender and refined are the love scenes--at the ball andin the garden--between the dashing prince-lover in search of hispleasure and the devoted girl with her heart in her eyes, on herlips, in her hand.  Behind them, always like a tragic fate, thesomber figure of the Spagnoletto, and over all the glow and colorand soul of Italy.In 1881 appeared the translation of Heine's poems and ballads, whichwas generally accepted as the best version of that untranslatablepoet.  Very curious is the link between that bitter, mocking, cynicspirit and the refined, gentle spirit of Emma Lazarus.  Charmed bythe magic of his verse, the iridescent play of his fancy, and thesudden cry of the heart piercing through it all, she is as yet unawareor only vaguely conscious of the of the real bond between them: thesympathy in the blood, the deep, tragic, Judaic passion of eighteenhundred years that was smouldering in her own heart, soon to breakout and change the whole current of thought and feeling.Already, in 1879, the storm was gathering.  In a distant provinceof Russia at first, then on the banks of the Volga, and finally inMoscow itself, the old cry was raised, the hideous mediaeval chargerevived, and the standard of persecution unfurled against the Jews.Province after province took it up.  In Bulgaria, Servia, and, aboveall, Roumania, where, we were told, the sword of the Czar had beendrawn to protect the oppressed, Christian atrocities took the placeof Moslem atrocities, and history turned a page backward into the darkannals of violence and crime.  And not alone in despotic Russia, butin Germany, the seat of modern philosophic thought and culture, therage of Anti-Semitism broke out and spread with fatal ease andpotency.In Berlin itself tumults and riots were threatened.  We in Americacould scarcely comprehend the situation or credit the reports, andfor a while we shut our eyes and ears to the facts; but we were soonrudely awakened from our insensibility, and forced to face the truth.It was in England that the voice was first raised in behalf ofjustice and humanity.  In January, 1881, there appeared in the"London Times" a series of articles, carefully compiled on thetestimony of eye-witnesses, and confirmed by official documents,records, etc., giving an account of events that had been taking placein southern and western Russia during a period of nine months,between April and December of 1880.  We do not need to recall thesickening details.  The headings will suffice: outrage, murder, arson,and pillage, and the result,--100,000 Jewish families made homelessand destitute, and nearly $100,000,000 worth of property destroyed.Nor need we recall the generous outburst of sympathy and indignationfrom America.  "It is not that it is the oppression of Jews byRussia," said Mr. Evarts in the meeting at Chickering Hall Wednesdayevening, February 4; "it is that it is the oppression of men andwomen, and we are men and women."  So spoke civilized Christendom,and for Judaism,-- who can describe that thrill of brotherhood,quickened anew, the immortal pledge of the race, made one againthrough sorrow?  For Emma Lazarus it was a trumpet call that awokeslumbering and unguessed echoes.  All this time she had been seekingheroic ideals in alien stock, soulless and far removed; in paganmythology and mystic, mediaeval Christianity, ignoring her verybirthright,--the majestic vista of the past, down which, "high aboveflood and fire," had been conveyed the precious scroll of the MoralLaw.  Hitherto Judaism had been a dead letter to her.  Of Portuguesedescent, her family had always been members of the oldest and mostorthodox congregation of New York, where strict adherence to customand ceremonial was the watchword of faith; but it was only duringher childhood and earliest years that she attended the synagogue,and conformed to the prescribed rites and usages which she had nowlong since abandoned as obsolete and having no bearing on modernlife.  Nor had she any great enthusiasm for her own people.  As lateas April, 1882, she published in "The Century Magazine" an articlewritten probably some months before, entitled "Was the Earl ofBeaconsfield a Representative Jew?" in which she is disposed toaccept as the type of the modern Jew the brilliant, successful, butnot over-scrupulous chevalier d'industrie.  In view of subsequent,or rather contemporaneous events, the closing paragraph of the articlein question is worthy  of being cited:--    "Thus far their religion [the Jewish], whose mere preservation    under such adverse conditions seems little short of a miracle,    has been deprived of the natural means of development and    progress, and has remained a stationary force.  The next    hundred years will, in our opinion be the test of their    vitality as a people; the phase of toleration upon which    they are only now entering will prove whether or not they    are capable of growth."By a curious, almost fateful juxtaposition, in the same number ofthe magazine appeared Madame Ragozin's defense of Russian barbarity,and in the following (May) number Emma Lazarus's impassioned appealand reply, "Russian Christianity versus Modern Judaism."  Fromthis time dated the crusade that she undertook in behalf of her race,and the consequent expansion of all her faculties, the growth ofspiritual power which always ensues when a great cause is espousedand a strong conviction enters the soul.  Her verse rang out as ithad never rung before,--a clarion note, calling a people to heroicaction and unity, to the consciousness and fulfillment of a granddestiny.  When has Judaism been so stirred as by "The Crowing ofthe Red Cock" and                      THE BANNER OF THE JEW.              Wake, Israel, wake!  Recall to-day              The glorious Maccabean rage,              The sire heroic, hoary-gray,              His five-fold lion-lineage;              The Wise, the Elect, the Help-of-God,              The Burst-of-Spring, the Avenging Rod.              From Mizpeh's mountain ridge they saw              Jerusalem's empty streets; her shrine              Laid waste where Greeks profaned the Law              With idol and with pagan sign.              Mourners in tattered black were there              With ashes sprinkled on their hair.              Then from the stony peak there rang              A blast to ope the graves; down poured              The Maccabean clan, who sang              Their battle anthem to the Lord.              Five heroes lead, and following, see              Ten thousand rush to victory!              Oh for Jerusalem's trumpet now,              To blow a blast of shattering power,              To wake the sleeper high and low,              And rouse them to the urgent hour!              No hand for vengeance, but to save,              A million naked swords should wave.              Oh, deem not dead that martial fire,              Say not the mystic flame is spent!              With Moses' law and David's lyre,              Your ancient strength remains unbent.              Let but an Ezra rise anew,              To lift the BANNER OF THE JEW!              A rag, a mock at first,--erelong              When men have bled and women wept,              To guard its precious folds from wrong,              Even they who shrunk, even they who slept,              Shall leap to bless it and to save.              Strike! for the brave revere the brave!The dead forms burst their bonds and lived again.  She sings "RoshHashanah" (the Jewish New Year) and "Hanuckah (the Feast of Lights):--        "Kindle the taper like the steadfast star         Ablaze on Evening's forehead o'er the earth,         And add each night a lustre till afar         An eight-fold splendor shine above thy hearth.         Clash, Israel, the cymbals, touch the lyre,         Blow the brass trumpet and the harsh-tongued horn;         Chant psalms of victory till the heart take fire,         The Maccabean spirit leap new-born."  And "The New Ezekiel:"--        "What! can these dead bones live, whose sap is dried         By twenty scorching centuries of wrong?         Is this the House of Israel whose pride         Is as a tale that's told, an ancient song?         Are these ignoble relics all that live         Of psalmist, priest, and prophet?  Can the breath         Of very heaven bid these bones revive,         Open the graves, and clothe the ribs of death?         Yea, Prophesy, the Lord hath said again:         Say to the wind, come forth and breathe afresh,         Even that they may live, upon these slain,         And bone to bone shall leap, and flesh to flesh.         The spirit is not dead, proclaim the word.         Where lay dead bones a host of armed men stand!         I ope your graves, my people, saith the Lord,         And I shall place you living in your land."Her whole being renewed and refreshed itself at its very source.  Shethrew herself into the study of her race, its language, literature,and history.Breaking the outward crust, she pierced to the heart of the faithand "the miracle" of its survival.  What was it other than the ever-present, ever-vivifying spirit itself, which cannot die,--thereligious and ethical zeal which fires the whole history of thepeople, and of which she herself felt the living glow within her ownsoul?  She had come upon the secret and the genius of Judaism,--thatabsolute interpenetration and transfusion of spirit with body andsubstance which, taken literally, often reduces itself to a questionof food and drink, a dietary regulation, and again, in propersplendor,incarnates itself and shines out before humanity in the prophets,teachers, and saviors of mankind.Those were busy, fruitful years for Emma Lazarus, who worked, notwith the pen alone, but in the field of practical and beneficentactivity.  For there was an immense task to accomplish.  The tide ofimmigration had set in, and ship after ship came laden with huntedhuman beings flying from their fellow-men, while all the time, likea tocsin, rang the terrible story of cruelty and persecution,--horrorsthat the pen refuses to dwell upon.  By the hundreds and thousandsthey flocked upon our shores,--helpless, innocent victims of injusticeand oppression, panic-stricken in the midst of strange and utterlynew surroundings.Emma Lazarus came into personal contact with these people, andvisited them in their refuge on Ward Island.  While under theinfluence of all the emotions aroused by this great crisis in thehistory of her race, she wrote the "Dance of Death," a drama ofpersecution of the twelfth century, founded upon the authenticrecords,--unquestionably her finest work in grasp and scope, and, above all,in moral elevation and purport.  The scene is laid in Nordhausen, afree city in Thuringia, where the Jews, living, as the deemed, inabsolute security and peace, were caught up in the wave of persecutionthat swept over Europe at that time.  Accused of poisoning the wellsand causing the pestilence, or black death, as it was called, theywere condemned to be burned.We do not here intend to enter upon a critical or literary analysisof the play, or to point out dramatic merits or defects, but weshould like to make its readers feel with us the holy ardor andimpulse of the writer and the spiritual import of the work.  Theaction is without surprise, the doom fixed from the first; but soglowing is the canvas with local and historic color, so vital andintense the movement, so resistless, the "internal evidence," if wemay call it thus, penetrating its very substance and form, that we areswept along as by a wave of human sympathy and grief.  In contrastwith "The Spagnoletto," how large is the theme and how all-embracingthe catastrophe!  In place of the personal we have the drama ofthe universal.  Love is only a flash now,--a dream caught sight ofand at once renounced at a higher claim.        "Have you no smile to welcome love with, Liebhaid?         Why should you tremble?         Prince, I am afraid!         Afraid of my own heart, my unfathomed joy,         A blasphemy against my father's grief,         My people's agony!        "What good shall come, forswearing kith and God,         To follow the allurements of the heart?"asks the distracted maiden, torn between her love for he princelywooer and her devotion to the people among whom her lot has been cast.                                      "O God!            How shall I pray for strength to love him less            Than mine own soul!                                       No more of that,            I am all Israel's now.  Till this cloud pass,            I have no thought, no passion, no desire,            Save for my people."Individuals perish, but great ideas survive,--fortitude and courage,and that exalted loyalty and devotion to principle which alone areworth living and dying for.The Jews pass by in procession--men, women, and children--on theirway to the flames, to the sound of music, and in festal array,carryingthe gold and silver vessels, the roll of the law, the perpetual lampand the seven branched silver candle-stick of the synagogue.  Thecrowd hoot and jeer at them.           "The misers! they will take their gems and gold            Down to the grave!"                             "Let us rejoice"sing the Jewish youths in chorus; and the maidens:--           "Our feet stand within thy gates, O Zion!             Within thy portals, O Jerusalem!"The flames rise and dart among them; their garments wave, their jewelsflash, as they dance and sing in the crimson blaze.  The music ceases,a sound of crashing boards is heard and a great cry,--"Hallelujah!"What a glory and consecration of the martyrdom!  Where shall we find amore triumphant vindication and supreme victory of spirit over matter?                            "I see, I see,         How Israel's ever-crescent glory makes         These flames that would eclipse it dark as blots         Of candle-light against the blazing sun.         We die a thousand deaths,--drown, bleed, and burn.         Our ashes are dispersed unto the winds.         Yet the wild winds cherish the sacred seed,         The fire refuseth to consume.            .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .         Even as we die in honor, from our death         Shall bloom a myriad heroic lives,         Brave through our bright example, virtuous         Lest our great memory fall in disrepute."The "Dance to Death" was published, along with other poems andtranslations from the Hebrew poets of mediaeval Spain, in a smallcolumn entitled "Songs of a Semite."  The tragedy was dedicated, "Inprofound veneration and respect to the memory of George Eliot, theillustrious writer who did most among the artists of our day towardselevating and ennobling the spirit of Jewish nationality."For this was the idea that had caught the imagination of Emma Lazarus,--a restored and independent nationality and repatriation inPalestine.In her article in "The Century" of February, 1883, on the "JewishProblem," she says:--    "I am fully persuaded that all suggested solutions other    than this are but temporary palliatives. . . . The idea    formulated by George Eliot has already sunk into the minds    of many Jewish enthusiasts, and it germinates with miraculous    rapidity.  'The idea that I am possessed with,' says Deronda,    'is that of restoring a political existence to my people;    making them a nation again, giving them a national centre,    such as the English have, though they, too, are scattered    over the face of the globe.  That task which presents itself    to me as a duty. . . . I am resolved to devote my life to    it.  AT THE LEAST, I MAY AWAKEN A MOVEMENT IN OTHER MINDS    SUCH HAS BEEN AWAKENED IN MY OWN.'  Could the noble    prophetess who wrote the above words have lived but till to-    day to see the ever-increasing necessity of adopting her    inspired counsel, . . .she would have been herself astonished    at the flame enkindled by her seed of fire, and the practical    shape which the movement projected by her poetic vision is    beginning to assume."In November of 1882 appeared her first "Epistle to the Hebrews,"--one of a series of articles written for the "American Hebrew,"published weekly through several months.  Addressing herself nowto a Jewish audience, she sets forth without reserve her views andhopes for Judaism, now passionately holding up the mirror for theshortcomings and peculiarities of her race.  She says:--    "Every student of the Hebrew language is aware that we have    in the conjugation of our verbs a mode known as the 'intensive    voice,' which, by means of an almost imperceptible modification    of vowel-points, intensifies the meaning of the primitive root.    A similar significance seems to attach to the Jews themselves    in connection with the people among whom they dwell.  They are    the 'intensive form' of any nationality whose language and    customs they adopt. . . . Influenced by the same causes, they    represent the same results; but the deeper lights and shadows    of the Oriental temperament throw their failings, as well as    their virtues, into more prominent relief."In drawing the epistles to a close, February 24, 1883, she thussummarizes the special objects she has had in view:--    "My chief aim has been to contribute my mite towards arousing    that spirit of Jewish enthusiasm which might manifest itself:    First, in a return to varied pursuits and broad system of    physical and intellectual education adopted by our ancestors;    Second, in a more fraternal and practical movement towards    alleviating the sufferings of oppressed Jews in countries less    favored than our own; Third, in a closer and wider study of    Hebrew literature and history and finally, in a truer recognition    of the large principals of religion, liberty, and law upon    which Judaism is founded, and which should draw into harmonious    unity Jews of every shade of opinion."Her interest in Jewish affairs was at its height when she planned avisit abroad, which had been a long-cherished dream, and May 15, 1883,she sailed for England, accompanied by a younger sister.  We havedifficulty in recognizing the tragic priestess we have been portrayingin the enthusiastic child of travel who seems new-born into a newworld.  From the very outset she is in a maze of wonder and delight.At sea she writes:--    "Our last day on board ship was a vision of beauty from    morning till night,--the sea like a mirror and the sky    dazzling with light.  In the afternoon we passed a ship    in full sail, near enough to exchange salutes and cheers.    After tossing about for six days without seeing a human    being, except those on our vessel, even this was a sensation.    Then an hour or two before sunset came the great sensation    of--land!  At first, nothing but a shadow on the far horizon,    like the ghost of a ship; two or three widely scattered rocks    which were the promontories of Ireland, and sooner than we    expected we were steaming along low-lying purple hills."The journey to Chester gives her "the first glimpse of mellowEngland,"--a surprise which is yet no surprise, so well known andfamiliar does it appear.  Then Chester, with its quaint, picturesquestreets, "like the scene of a Walter Scott novel, the cathedralplanted in greenness, and the clear, gray river where a boatful ofscarlet dragoons goes gliding by."  Everything is a picture for herspecial benefit.  She "drinks in, at every sense, the sights, sounds,and smells, and the unimaginable beauty of it all."  Then thebewilderment of London, and a whirl of people, sights, andimpressions.She was received with great distinction by the Jews, and many of theleading men among them warmly advocated her views.  But it was notalone from her own people that she met with exceptional consideration.She had the privilege of seeing many of the most eminent personagesof the day, all of whom honored her with special and personal regard.There was, no doubt, something that strongly attracted people to herat this time,--the force of her intellect at once made itself felt,while at the same time the unaltered simplicity and modesty of hercharacter, and her readiness and freshness of enthusiasm, kept herstill almost like a child.She makes a flying visit to Paris, where she happens to be on the 14thof July, the anniversary of the storming of the Bastile, and of thebeginning of the republic; she drives to Versailles, "that gorgeousshell of royalty, where the crowd who celebrate the birth of therepublic wander freely through the halls and avenues, and into themost sacred rooms of the king. . . . There are ruins on every side inParis," she says; "ruins of the Commune, or the Siege, or theRevolution; it is terrible--it seems as if the city were seared withfire and blood."Such was Paris to her then, and she hastens back to her belovedLondon,starting from there on the tour through England that has been mappedout for her.  "A Day in Surrey with William Morris," published in"The Century Magazine," describes her visit to Merton Abbey, theold  Norman monastery, converted into a model factory by the poet-humanitarian, who himself received her as his guest, conducted herall over the picturesque building and garden, and explained to herhis views of art and his aims for the people.She drives through Kent, "where the fields, valleys, and slopes aregarlanded with hops and ablaze with scarlet poppies."  ThenCanterbury,Windsor, and Oxford, Stratford, Warwick, the valley of the Wye, Wells,Exeter, and Salisbury,--cathedral after cathedral.  Back to London,and then north through York, Durham, and Edinburgh, and on the 15thof September she sails for home.  We have merely named the names,for it is impossible to convey an idea of the delight and importanceof this trip, "a crescendo of enjoyment," as she herself calls it.Long after, in strange, dark hours of suffering, these pictures oftravel arose before her, vivid and tragic even in their hold andspell upon her.The winter of 1883-84 was not especially productive.  She wrote afew reminiscences of her journey and occasional poems on the Jewishthemes, which appeared in the "American Hebrew;" but for the mostpart gave herself up to quiet retrospect and enjoyment with herfriends of the life she had had a glimpse of, and the experience shehad stored,--a restful, happy period.  In August of the same yearshe was stricken with a severe and dangerous malady, from which sheslowly recovered, only to go through a terrible ordeal and affliction.Her father's health, which had long been failing, now broke downcompletely, and the whole winter was one long strain of acute anxiety,which culminated in his death, in March, 1885.  The blow was acrushing one for Emma.  Truly, the silver cord was loosed, and thegolden bowl broken.  Life lost its meaning and charm.  Her father'ssympathy and pride in her work had been her chief incentive andambition, and had spurred her on when her own confidence and spiritfailed.  Never afterwards did she find complete and spontaneousexpression.  She decided to go abroad as the best means of regainingcomposure and strength and sailed once more in May for England,where she was welcomed now by the friends she had made, almost asto another home.  She spent the summer very quietly at Richmond,anideally beautiful spot in Yorkshire, where she soon felt thebeneficial influence of her peaceful surroundings.  "The very airseems to rest one here," she writes; and inspired by the romanticloveliness of the place, she even composed the first few chaptersof a novel, begun with a good deal of dash and vigor, but soonabandoned, for she was still struggling with depression and gloom."I have neither ability, energy, nor purpose," she writes.  "It isimpossible to do anything, so I am forced to set it aside for thepresent; whether to take it up again or not in the future remainsto be seen."In the autumn she goes on the Continent, visiting the Hague, which"completely fascinates" her, and where she feels "stronger and morecheerful" than she has "for many a day."  Then Paris, which this timeamazes her "with its splendor and magnificence.  All the ghosts ofthe Revolution are somehow laid," she writes, and she spends sixweeks here enjoying to the full the gorgeous autumn weather, thesights, the picture galleries, the bookshops, the whole brilliantpanorama of the life; and early in December she starts for Italy.And now once more we come upon that keen zest of enjoyment, thatpure desire and delight of the eyes, which are the prerogative ofthe poet,--Emma Lazarus was a poet.  The beauty of the world,--whata rapture and intoxication it is, and how it bursts upon her in thevery land of beauty, "where Dante and Petrarch trod!"  A magic glowcolours it all; no mere blues and greens anymore, but a splendor ofpurple and scarlet and emerald; "each tower, castle, and villageshining like a jewel; the olive, the fig, and at your feet the roses,growing in mid-December."  A day in Pisa seems like a week, so crowdedis it with sensations and unforgettable pictures.  Then a month inFlorence, which is still more entrancing with its inexhaustibletreasures of beauty and art; and finally Rome, the climax of it all,--    "wiping out all other places and impressions, and opening    a whole new world of sensations.  I am wild with the    excitement of this tremendous place.  I have been here a    week, and have seen the Vatican and the Capitoline Museums,    and the Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter's, besides the ruins    on the streets and on the hills, and the graves of Shelley    and Keats.    "It is all heart-breaking.  I don't only mean those beautiful    graves, overgrown with acanthus and violets, but the mutilated    arches and columns and dumb appealing fragments looming up in    the glowing sunshine under the Roman blue sky."True to her old attractions, it is pagan Rome that appeals to hermost strongly,--    "and the far-away past, that seems so sad and strange and    near.  I am even out of humor with pictures; a bit of broken    stone or a  fragment of a bas-relief, or a Corinthian column    standing out against this lapis-lazuli sky, or a tremendous    arch, are the only things I can look at for the moment,--    except the Sistine Chapel, which is as gigantic as the rest,    and forces itself upon you with equal might."Already, in February, spring is in the air; "the almond-trees are inbloom, violets cover the grass, and oh! the divine, the celestial,the unheard-of beauty of it all!"  It is almost a pang for her, "withits strange mixture of longing and regret and delight," and in themidst of it she says, "I have to exert all my strength not to losemyself in morbidness and depression."Early in March she leaves Rome, consoled with the thought of returningthe following winter.  In June she was in England again, and spentthe summer at Malvern.  Disease was no doubt already beginning toprey upon her, for she was oppressed at times by a languor andheaviness amounting almost to lethargy.  When she returned to London,however, in September, she felt quite well again, and started foranother tour in Holland, which she enjoyed as much as before.  Shethen settled in Paris, to await the time when she could return toItaly.  But she was attacked at once with grave and alarming symptoms,that betokened a fatal end to her malady.  Entirely ignorant, however,of the danger that threatened her, she kept up courage and hope,made plans for the journey, and looked forward to setting out atany moment.  But the weeks passed and the months also; slowly andgradually the hope faded.  The journey to Italy must be given up;she was not in condition to be brought home, and she reluctantlyresigned herself to remain where she was and "convalesce," as sheconfidently believed, in the spring.  Once again came the analogy,which she herself pointed out now, to Heine on his mattress-gravein Paris.  She, too, the last time she went out, dragged herself tothe Louvre, to the feet of the Venus, "the goddess without arms, whocould not help."  Only her indomitable will and intense desire tolive seemed to keep her alive.  She sunk to a very low ebb, but, asshe herself expressed it, she "seemed to have always one littlewindow looking out into life," and in the spring she ralliedsufficiently to take a few drives and to sit on the balcony of herapartment.  She came back to life with a feverish sort of thirst andavidity.  "No such cure for pessimism," she says, "as a severeillness;the simplest pleasures are enough,--to breathe the air and see thesun."Many plans were made for leaving Paris, but it was finally decidedto risk the ocean voyage and bring her home, and accordingly shesailed July 23rd, arriving in New York on the last day of that month.She did not rally after this; and now began her long agony, fullof every kind of suffering, mental and physical.  Only her intellectseemed kindled anew, and none but those who saw her during the lastsupreme ordeal can realize that wonderful flash and fire of thespirit before its extinction.  Never did she appear so brilliant.Wasted to a shadow, and between acute attacks of pain, she talkedabout art, poetry, the scenes of travel, of which her brain was sofull, and the phases of her own condition, with an eloquence forwhich even those who knew her best were quite unprepared.  Everyfaculty seemed sharpened and every sense quickened as the "strongdeliveress" approached, and the ardent soul was released from theframe that could no longer contain it.We cannot restrain a feeling of suddenness and incompleteness anda natural pang of wonder and regret for a life so richly and sovitally endowed thus cut off in its prime.  But for us it is notfitting to question or repine, but rather to rejoice in the rarepossession that we hold.  What is any life, even the most roundedand complete, but a fragment and a hint?  What Emma Lazarus mighthave accomplished, had she been spared, it is idle and evenungrateful to speculate.  What she did accomplish has real andpeculiar significance.  It is the privilege of a favored few thatevery fact and circumstance of their individuality shall add lustreand value to what they achieve.  To be born a Jewess was a distinctionfor Emma Lazarus, and she in turn conferred distinction upon herrace.  To be born a woman also lends a grace and a subtle magnetismto her influence.  Nowhere is there contradiction or incongruity.Her works bear the imprint of her character, and her character ofher works; the same directness and honesty, the same limpid purityof tone, and the same atmosphere of things refined and beautiful.The vulgar, the false, and the ignoble,--she scarcely comprehendedthem, while on every side she was open and ready to take in andrespond to whatever can adorn and enrich life.  Literature was nomere "profession" for her, which shut out other possibilities; itwas only a free, wide horizon and background for culture.  She waspassionately devoted to music, which inspired some of her best poems;and during the last years of her life, in hours of intense physicalsuffering, she found relief and consolation in listening to thestrains of Bach and Beethoven.  When she went abroad, painting wasrevealed to her, and she threw herself with the same ardor andenthusiasm into the study of the great masters; her last work (leftunfinished) was a critical analysis of the genius and personalityof Rembrandt.And now, at the end, we ask, Has the grave really closed over allthese gifts?  Has that eager, passionate striving ceased, and "isthe rest silence?"Who knows?  But would we break, if we could, that repose, thatsilence and mystery and peace everlasting?                        EPOCHS. "The epochs of our life are not in the facts, but in the    silent thought by the wayside as we walk."--Emerson               I. Youth.Sweet empty sky of June without a stain,  Faint, gray-blue dewy mists on far-off hills,Warm, yellow sunlight flooding mead and plain,  That each dark copse and hollow overfills;  The rippling laugh of unseen, rain-fed rills,Weeds delicate-flowered, white and pink and gold,A murmur and a singing manifold.The gray, austere old earth renews her youth  With dew-lines, sunshine, gossamer, and haze.How still she lies and dreams, and veils the truth,  While all is fresh as in the early days!  What simple things be these the soul to raiseTo bounding joy, and make young pulses beat,With nameless pleasure finding life so sweet.On such a golden morning forth there floats,  Between the soft earth and the softer sky,In the warm air adust with glistening motes,  The mystic winged and flickering butterfly,  A human soul, that hovers giddilyAmong the gardens of earth's paradise,Nor dreams of fairer fields or loftier skies.               II. Regret.Thin summer rain on grass and bush and hedge,  Reddening the road and deepening the greenOn wide, blurred lawn, and in close-tangled sedge;  Veiling in gray the landscape stretched between  These low broad meadows and the pale hills seenBut dimly on the far horizon's edge.In these transparent-clouded, gentle skies,  Wherethrough the moist beams of the soft June sunMight any moment break, no sorrow lies,  No note of grief in swollen brooks that run,  No hint of woe in this subdued, calm toneOf all the prospect unto dreamy eyes.Only a tender, unnamed half-regret  For the lost beauty of the gracious morn;A yearning aspiration, fainter yet,  For brighter suns in joyous days unborn,  Now while brief showers ruffle grass and corn,And all the earth lies shadowed, grave, and wet;Space for the happy soul to pause again  From pure content of all unbroken bliss,To dream the future void of grief and pain,  And muse upon the past, in reveries  More sweet for knowledge that the present isNot all complete, with mist and clouds and rain.               III. Longing.Look westward o'er the steaming rain-washed slopes,  Now satisfied with sunshine, and beholdThose lustrous clouds, as glorious as our hopes,  Softened with feathery fleece of downy gold,  In all fantastic, huddled shapes uprolled,Floating like dreams, and melting silently,In the blue upper regions of pure sky.The eye is filled with beauty, and the heart  Rejoiced with sense of life and peace renewed;And yet at such an hour as this, upstart  Vague myriad longing, restless, unsubdued,  And causeless tears from melancholy mood,Strange discontent with earth's and nature's best,Desires and yearnings that may find no rest.               IV. Storm.Serene was morning with clear, winnowed air,  But threatening soon the low, blue mass of cloudRose in the west, with mutterings faint and rare  At first, but waxing frequent and more loud.  Thick sultry mists the distant hill-tops shroud;The sunshine dies; athwart black skies of leadFlash noiselessly thin threads of lightning red.Breathless the earth seems waiting some wild blow,  Dreaded, but far too close to ward or shun.Scared birds aloft fly aimless, and below  Naught stirs in fields whence light and life are gone,  Save floating leaves, with wisps of straw and down,Upon the heavy air; 'neath blue-black skies,Livid and yellow the green landscape lies.And all the while the dreadful thunder breaks,  Within the hollow circle of the hills,With gathering might, that angry echoes wakes,  And earth and heaven with unused clamor fills.  O'erhead still flame those strange electric thrills.A moment more,--behold! yon bolt struck home,And over ruined fields the storm hath come!               V. Surprise.When the stunned soul can first lift tired eyes  On her changed world of ruin, waste and wrack,Ah, what a pang of aching sharp surprise  Brings all sweet memories of the lost past back,With wild self-pitying grief of one betrayed,Duped in a land of dreams where Truth is dead!Are these the heavens that she deemed were kind?  Is this the world that yesterday was fair?What painted images of folk half-blind  Be these who pass her by, as vague as air?What go they seeking? there is naught to find.Let them come nigh and hearken her despair.A mocking lie is all she once believed,  And where her heart throbbed, is a cold dead stone.This is a doom we never preconceived,  Yet now she cannot fancy it undone.Part of herself, part of the whole hard scheme,All else is but the shadow of a dream.               VI. Grief.There is a hungry longing in the soul,  A craving sense of emptiness and pain,She may not satisfy nor yet control,  For all the teeming world looks void and vain.No compensation in eternal spheres,She knows the loneliness of all her years.There is no comfort looking forth nor back,  The present gives the lie to all her past.Will cruel time restore what she doth lack?  Why was no shadow of this doom forecast?Ah! she hath played with many a keen-edged thing;Naught is too small and soft to turn and sting.In the unnatural glory of the hour,  Exalted over time, and death, and fate,No earthly task appears beyond her power,  No possible endurance seemeth great.She knows her misery and her majesty,And recks not if she be to live or die.               VII. Acceptance.Yea, she hath looked Truth grimly face to face,  And drained unto the lees the proffered cup.This silence is not patience, nor the grace  Of recognition, meekly offered up,But mere acceptance fraught with keenest pain,Seeing that all her struggles must be vain.Her future clear and terrible outlies,--  This burden to be borne through all her days,This crown of thorns pressed down above her eyes,  This weight of trouble she may never raise.No reconcilement doth she ask nor wait;Knowing such things are, she endures her fate.No brave endeavor of the broken will  To cling to such poor stays as will abide(Although the waves be wild and angry still)  After the lapsing of the swollen tide.No fear of further loss, no hope of gain,Naught but the apathy of weary pain.               VIII. Loneliness.All stupor of surprise hath passed away;  She sees, with clearer vision than before,A world far off of light and laughter gay,  Herself alone and lonely evermore.Folk come and go, and reach her in no wise,Mere flitting phantoms to her heavy eyes.All outward things, that once seemed part of her,  Fall from her, like the leaves in autumn shed.She feels as one embalmed in spice and myrrh,  With the heart eaten out, a long time dead;Unchanged without, the features and the form;Within, devoured by the thin red worm.By her own prowess she must stand or fall,  This grief is to be conquered day by day.Who could befriend her? who could make this small,  Or her strength great? she meets it as she may.A weary struggle and a constant pain,She dreams not they may ever cease nor wane.               IX. Sympathy.It comes not in such wise as she had deemed,  Else might she still have clung to her despair.More tender, grateful than she could have dreamed,  Fond hands passed pitying over brows and hair,  And gentle words borne softly through the air,Calming her weary sense and wildered mind,By welcome, dear communion with her kind.Ah! she forswore all words as empty lies;  What speech could help, encourage, or repair?Yet when she meets these grave, indulgent eyes,  Fulfilled with pity, simplest words are fair,  Caressing, meaningless, that do not dareTo compensate or mend, but merely sootheWith hopeful visions after bitter Truth.One who through conquered trouble had grown wise,  To read the grief unspoken, unexpressed, The misery of the blank and heavy eyes,--  Or through youth's infinite compassion guessed  The heavy burden,--such a one brought rest,And bade her lay aside her doubts and fears,While the hard pain dissolved in blessed tears.               X. Patience.The passion of despair is quelled at last;  The cruel sense of undeserved wrong,The wild self-pity, these are also past;  She knows not what may come, but she is strong;She feels she hath not aught to lose nor gain,Her patience is the essence of all pain.As one who sits beside a lapsing stream,  She sees the flow of changeless day by day,Too sick and tired to think, too sad to dream,  Nor cares how soon the waters slip away,Nor where they lead; at the wise God's decree,She will depart or bide indifferently.There is deeper pathos in the mild  And settled sorrow of the quiet eyes,Than in the tumults of the anguish wild,  That made her curse all things beneath the skies;No question, no reproaches, no complaint,Hers is the holy calm of some meek saint.               XI. Hope.Her languid pulses thrill with sudden hope,  That will not be forgot nor cast aside,And life in statelier vistas seems to ope,  Illimitably lofty, long, and wide.What doth she know?  She is subdued and mild,Quiet and docile "as a weaned child."If grief came in such unimagined wise,  How may joy dawn?  In what undreamed-of hour,May the light break with splendor of surprise,  Disclosing all the mercy and the power?A baseless hope, yet vivid, keen, and bright,As the wild lightning in the starless night.She knows not whence it came, nor where it passed,  But it revealed, in one brief flash of flame,A heaven so high, a world so rich and vast,  That, full of meek contrition and mute shame,In patient silence hopefully withdrawn,She bows her head, and bides the certain dawn.               XII. Compensation.'T is not alone that black and yawning void  That makes her heart ache with this hungry pain,But the glad sense of life hath been destroyed,  The lost delight may never come again.Yet myriad serious blessings with grave graceArise on every side to fill their place.For much abides in her so lonely life,--  The dear companionship of her own kind,Love where least looked for, quiet after strife,  Whispers of promise upon every wind,A quickened insight, in awakened eyes,For the new meaning of the earth and skies.The nameless charm about all things hath died,  Subtle as aureole round a shadow's head,Cast on the dewy grass at morning-tide;  Yet though the glory and the joy be fled,'T is much her own endurance to have weighed,And wrestled with God's angels, unafraid.               XIII. Faith.She feels outwearied, as though o'er her head  A storm of mighty billows broke and passed.Whose hand upheld her?  Who her footsteps led  To this green haven of sweet rest at last?What strength was hers, unreckoned and unknown?What love sustained when she was most alone?Unutterably pathetic her desire,  To reach, with groping arms outstretched in prayer,Something to cling to, to uplift her higher  From this low world of coward fear and care,Above disaster, that her will may beAt one with God's, accepting his decree.Though by no reasons she be justified,  Yet strangely brave in Evil's very face,She deems this want must needs be satisfied,  Though here all slips from out her weak embrace.And in blind ecstasy of perfect faith,With her own dream her prayer she answereth.               XIV. Work.Yet life is not a vision nor a prayer,  But stubborn work; she may not shun her task.After the first compassion, none will spare  Her portion and her work achieved, to ask.She pleads for respite,--she will come ere longWhen, resting by the roadside, she is strong.Nay, for the hurrying throng of passers-by  Will crush her with their onward-rolling stream.Much must be done before the brief light die;  She may not loiter, rapt in the vain dream.With unused trembling hands, and faltering feet,She staggers forth, her lot assigned to meet.But when she fills her days with duties done,  Strange vigor comes, she is restored to health.New aims, new interests rise with each new sun,  And life still holds for her unbounded wealth.All that seemed hard and toilsome now proves small,And naught may daunt her,--she hath strength for all.               XV. Victory.How strange, in some brief interval of rest,  Backward to look on her far-stretching past.To see how much is conquered and repressed,  How much is gained in victory at last!The shadow is not lifted,--but her faith,Strong from life's miracles, now turns toward death.Though much be dark where once rare splendor shone,  Yet the new light has touched high peaks unguessedIn her gold, mist-bathed dawn, and one by one  New outlooks loom from many a mountain crest.She breathes a loftier, purer atmosphere,And life's entangled paths grow straight and clear.Nor will Death prove an all-unwelcome guest;  The struggle has been toilsome to this end,Sleep will be sweet, and after labor rest,  And all will be atoned with him to friend.Much must be reconciled, much justified,And yet she feels she will be satisfied.               XVI. Peace.The calm outgoing of a long, rich day,  Checkered with storm and sunshine, gloom and light,Now passing in pure, cloudless skies away,  Withdrawing into silence of blank night.  Thick shadows settle on the landscape bright,Like the weird cloud of death that falls apaceOn the still features of the passive face.Soothing and gentle as a mother's kiss,  The touch that stopped the beating of the heart.A look so blissfully serene as this,  Not all the joy of living could impart.With dauntless faith and courage therewithal,The Master found her ready at his call.On such a golden evening forth there floats,  Between the grave earth and the glowing skyIn the clear air, unvexed with hazy motes,  The mystic-winged and flickering butterfly,  A human soul, that drifts at liberty,Ah! who can tell to what strange paradise,To what undreamed-of fields and lofty skies.!               HOW LONG?  How long, and yet how long,Our leaders will we hail from over seas,Master and kings from feudal monarchies,  And mock their ancient songWith echoes weak of foreign melodies?  That distant isle mist-wreathed,Mantled in unimaginable green,Too long hath been our mistress and our queen.  Our fathers have bequeathedToo deep a love for her, our hearts within.  She made the whole world ringWith the brave exploits of her children strong,And with the matchless music of her song.  Too late, too late we clingTo alien legends, and their strains prolong.  This fresh young world I see,With heroes, cities, legends of her own;With a new race of men, and overblown  By winds from sea to sea,Decked with the majesty of every zone.  I see the glittering topsOf snow-peaked mounts, the wid'ning vale's expanse,Large prairies where free herds of horses prance,  Exhaustless wealth of crops,In vast, magnificent extravagance.  These grand, exuberant plains,These stately rivers, each with many a mouth,The exquisite beauty of the soft-aired south,  The boundless seas of grains,Luxuriant forests' lush and splendid growth.  The distant siren-songOf the green island in the eastern sea,Is not the lay for this new chivalry.  It is not free and strongTo chant on prairies 'neath this brilliant sky.  The echo faints and fails;It suiteth not, upon this western plain,Out voice or spirit; we should stir again  The wilderness, and make the valesResound unto a yet unheard-of strain.               HEROES.  In rich Virginian woods,The scarlet creeper reddens over graves,Among the solemn trees enlooped with vines;Heroic spirits haunt the solitudes,--The noble souls of half a million braves,  Amid the murmurous pines.  Ah! who is left behind,Earnest and eloquent, sincere and strong,To consecrate their memories with wordsNot all unmeet? with fitting dirge and songTo chant a requiem purer than the wind,  And sweeter than the birds?  Here, though all seems at peace,The placid, measureless sky serenely fair,The laughter of the breeze among the leaves,The bars of sunlight slanting through the trees,The reckless wild-flowers blooming everywhere,  The grasses' delicate sheaves,--  Nathless each breeze that blows,Each tree that trembles to its leafy headWith nervous life, revives within our mind,Tender as flowers of May, the thoughts of thoseWho lie beneath the living beauty, dead,--  Beneath the sunshine, blind.  For brave dead soldiers, these:Blessings and tears of aching thankfulness,Soft flowers for the graves in wreaths enwove,The odorous lilac of dear memories,The heroic blossoms of the wilderness,  And the rich rose of love.  But who has sung their praise,Not less illustrious, who are living yet?Armies of heroes, satisfied to passCalmly, serenely from the whole world's gaze,And cheerfully accept, without regret,  Their old life as it was,  With all its petty pain,Its irritating littleness and care;They who have scaled the mountain, with contentSublime, descend to live upon the plain;Steadfast as though they breathed the mountain-air  Still, wheresoe'er they went.  They who were brave to act,And rich enough their action to forget;Who, having filled their day with chivalry,Withdraw and keep their simpleness intact,And all unconscious add more lustre yet  Unto their victory.  On the broad Western plainsTheir patriarchal life they live anew;Hunters as mighty as the men of old,Or harvesting the plenteous, yellow grains,Gathering ripe vintage of dusk bunches blue,Or working mines of gold;  Or toiling in the town,Armed against hindrance, weariness, defeat,With dauntless purpose not to serve or yield,And calm, defiant, they struggle on,As sturdy and as valiant in the street,  As in the camp and field.  And those condemned to live,Maimed, helpless, lingering still through suffering years,May they not envy now the restful sleepOf the dear fellow-martyrs they survive?Not o'er the dead, but over these, your tears,  O brothers, ye may weep!  New England fields I see,The lovely, cultured landscape, waving grain,Wide haughty rivers, and pale, English skies.And lo! a farmer ploughing busily,Who lifts a swart face, looks upon the plain,--  I see, in his frank eyes,  The hero's soul appear.Thus in the common fields and streets they stand;The light that on the past and distant gleams,They cast upon the present and the near,With antique virtues from some mystic land,  Of knightly deeds and dreams.               ADMETUS.    To my friend, Ralph Waldo Emerson.  He who could beard the lion in his lair,To bind him for a girl, and tame the boar,And drive these beasts before his chariot,Might wed Alcestis.  For her low brows' sake,Her hairs' soft undulations of warm gold,Her eyes clear color and pure virgin mouth,Though many would draw bow or shiver spear,Yet none dared meet the intolerable eye,Or lipless tusk, of lion or boar.This heard Admetus, King of Thessaly,Whose broad, fat pastures spread their ample fieldsDown to the sheer edge of Amphrysus' stream,Who laughed, disdainful, at the father's pride,That set such value on one milk-faced child.  One morning, as he rode alone and passedThrough the green twilight of Thessalian woods,Between two pendulous branches interlocked,As through an open casement, he descriedA goddess, as he deemed,--in truth a maid.On a low bank she fondled tenderlyA favorite hound, her floral face inclinedabove the glossy, graceful animal,That pressed his snout against her cheek and gazedWistfully, with his keen, sagacious eyes.One arm with lax embrace the neck enwreathed,With polished roundness near the sleek, gray skin.Admetus, fixed with wonder,dare not pass,Intrusive on her holy innocenceAnd sacred girlhood, but his fretful steedSnuffed the air, and champed and pawed the ground;And hearing this, the maiden raised her head.No let or hindrance then might stop the king,Once having looked upon those supreme eyes.The drooping boughs disparting, forth he sped,And then drew in his steed, to ask the path,Like a lost traveller in an alien land.Although each river-cloven vale, with streamsArrowy glancing to the blue Aegean,Each hallowed mountain, the abode of gods,Pelion and Ossa fringed with haunted groves,The height, spring-crowned, of dedicate Olympus,And pleasant sun-fed vineyards, were to himFamiliar as his own face in the stream,Nathless he paused and asked the maid what pathMight lead him from the forest.  She replied,But still he tarried, and with sportsman's praiseAdmired the hound and stooped to stroke its head,And asked her if she hunted.  Nay, not she:Her father Pelias hunted in these woods,Where there was royal game.  He knew her now,--Alcestis,--and he left her with due thanks:No goddess, but a mortal, to be wonBy such a simple feat as driving boarsAnd lions to his chariot.  What was thatTo him who saw the boar of Calydon,The sacred boar of Artemis, at bayIn the broad stagnant marsh, and sent his dartsIn its tough, quivering flank, and saw its death,Stung by sure arrows of Arcadian nymph?  To river-pastures of his flocks and herdsAdmetus rode, where sweet-breathed cattle grazed,Heifers and goats and kids, and foolish sheepDotted cool, spacious meadows with bent heads,And necks' soft wool broken in yellow flakes,Nibbling sharp-toothed the rich, thick-growing blades.One herdsman kept the innumerable droves--A boy yet, young as immortality--In listless posture on a vine-grown rock.Around him huddled kids and sheep that leftThe mother's udder for his nighest grass,Which sprouted with fresh verdure where he sat.And yet dull neighboring rustics never guessedA god had been among them till he went,Although with him they acted as he willed,Renouncing shepherds' silly pranks and quips,Because his very presence made them grave.Amphryssius, after their translucent stream,They called him, but Admetus knew his name,--Hyperion, god of sun and song and silver speech,Condemned to serve a mortal for his sinTo Zeus in sending violent darts of death,A raising hand irreverent, againstThe one-eyed forgers of the thunderbolt.For shepherd's crook he held the living rodOf twisted serpents, later Hermes' wand.Him sought the king, discovering soon hard by,Idle as one in nowise bound to time,Watching the restless grasses blow and wave,The sparkle of the sun upon the stream,Regretting nothing, living with the hour:For him, who had his light and song within,Was naught that did not shine, and all things sang.Admetus prayed for his celestial aidTo win Alcestis, which the god vouchsafed,Granting with smiles, as grant all gods, who smiteWith stern hand, sparing not for piteousness,But give their gifts in gladness.                                   Thus the kingLed with loose rein the beasts as tame as kine,And townsfolk thronged within the city streets,As round a god; and mothers showed their babes,And maidens loved the crowned intrepid youth,And men aloud worship, though the very godWho wrought the wonder dwelled unnoted nigh,Divinely scornful of neglect or praise.Then Pelias, seeing this would be his son,As he had vowed, called for his wife and child.With Anaxibia, Alcestis came,A warm flush spreading o'er her eager faceIn looking on the rider of the woods,And knowing him her suitor and the king.  Admetus won Alcestis thus to wife,And these with mated hearts and mutual loveLived a life blameless, beautiful: the kingOrdaining justice in the gates; the queen,With grateful offerings to the household gods,Wise with the wisdom of the pure in heart.One child she bore,--Eumelus,--and he throve.Yet none the less because they sacrificedThe firstlings of their flocks and fruits and flowers,Did trouble come; for sickness seized the king.Alcestis watched with many-handed love,But unavailing service, for he layWith languid limbs, despite his ancient strengthOf sinew, and his skill with spear and sword.His mother came, Clymene, and with herHis father, Pheres: his unconscious childThey brought him, while forlorn Alcestis satDiscouraged, with the face of desolation.The jealous gods would bind his mouth from speech,And smite his vigorous frame with impotence;And ruin with bitter ashes, worms, and dust,The beauty of his crowned, exalted head.He knew her presence,--soon he would not know,Nor feel her hand in his lie warm and close,Nor care if she were near him any more.Exhausted with long vigils, thus the queenHeld hard and grievous thoughts, till heavy sleepPossessed her weary sense, and she dreamed.And even in her dream her trouble lived,For she was praying in a barren fieldTo all the gods for help, when came acrossThe waste of air and land, from distant skies,A spiritual voice divinely clear,Whose unimaginable sweetness thrilledHer aching heart with tremor of strange joy:"Arise, Alcestis, cast away white fear.A god dwells with you: seek, and you shall find."Then quiet satisfaction filled her soulAlmost akin to gladness, and she woke.Weak as the dead, Admetus lay there still;But she, superb with confidence, arose,And passed beyond the mourners' curious eyes,Seeking Amphryssius in the meadow-lands.She found him with the godlike mien of oneWho, roused, awakens unto deeds divine:"I come, Hyperion, with incessant tears,To crave the life of my dear lord the king.Pity me, for I see the future yearsWidowed and laden with disastrous days.And ye, the gods, will miss him when the firesUpon your shrines, unfed, neglected die.Who will pour large libations in your names,And sacrifice with generous piety?Silence and apathy will greet you thereWhere once a splendid spirit offered praise.Grant me this boon divine, and I will beatWith prayer at morning's gates, before they opeUnto thy silver-hoofed and flame-eyed steeds.Answer ere yet the irremeable streamBe crossed: answer, O god, and save!"                                   She ceased,With full throat salt with tears, and looked on him,And with a sudden cry of awe fell prone,For, lo! he was transmuted to a god;The supreme aureole radiant round his brow,Divine refulgences on his face,--his eyesAwful with splendor, and his august headWith blinding brilliance crowned by vivid flame.Then in a voice that charmed the listening air:"Woman, arise! I have no influenceOn Death, who is the servant of the Fates.Howbeit for thy passion and thy prayer,The grace of thy fair womanhood and youth,Thus godlike will I intercede for thee,And sue the insatiate sisters for this life.Yet hope not blindly: loth are these to changeTheir purpose; neither will they freely give,But haggling lend or sell: perchance the priceWill counterveil the boon.  Consider this.Now rise and look upon me."  And she rose,But by her stood no godhead bathed in light,But young Amphryssius, herdsman to the king,Benignly smiling.                    Fleet as thought, the godFled from the glittering earth to blackest depthsOf Tartarus; and none might say he spedOn wings ambrosial, or with feet as swiftAs scouring hail, or airy chariotBorne by the flame-breathing steeds ethereal;But with a motion inconceivableDeparted and was there.  Before the throneOf Ades, first he hailed the long-sought queen,Stolen with violent hands from grassy fieldsAnd delicate airs of sunlit Sicily,Pensive, gold-haired, but innocent-eyed no moreAs when she laughing plucked the daffodils,But grave as on fulfilling a strange doom.And low at Ades' feet, wrapped in grim murkAnd darkness thick, the three gray women sat,Loose-robed and chapleted with wool and flowers,Purple narcissi round their horrid hair.Intent upon her task, the first one heldThe tender thread that at a touch would snap;The second weaving it with warp and woofInto strange textures, some stained dark and foul,Some sanguine-colored, and some black as night,And rare ones white, or with a golden threadRunning throughout the web: the farthest hagWith glistening scissors cut her sisters' work.To these Hyperion, but they never ceased,Nor raised their eyes, till with soft, moderate tones,But by their powerful persuasivenessCommanding all to listen and obey,He spoke, and all hell heard, and these three lookedAnd waited his request:                             I come, a god,At pure mortal queen's request, who suesFor life renewed unto her dying lord,Admetus; and I also pray this prayer.""Then cease, for when hath Fate been moved by prayer?""But strength and upright heart should serve with you.""I ask ye not forever to forbear,But spare a while,--a moment unto us,A lifetime unto men."  "The Fates swerve notFor supplications, like the pliant gods.Have they not willed a life's thread should be cut?With them the will is changeless as the deed.O men! ye have not learned in all the past,Desires are barren and tears yield no fruit.How long will ye besiege the thrones of godsWith lamentations?  When lagged Death for allYour timorous shirking?  We work not like you,Delaying and relenting, purposeless,With unenduring issues; but our deeds,Forever interchained and interlocked,Complete each other and explain themselves.""Ye will a life: then why not any life?""What care we for the king?  He is not worthThese many words; indeed, we love not speech.We care not if he live, or lose such lifeAs men are greedy for,--filled full with hate,Sins beneath scorn, and only lit by dreams,Or one sane moment, or a useless hope,--Lasting how long?--the space between the greenAnd fading yellow of the grass they tread."But he withdrawing not: "Will any lifeSuffice ye for Admetus?"  "Yea," the cronesThree times repeated.  "We know no such namesAs king or queen or slave: we want but life.Begone, and vex us in our work no more."  With broken blessings, inarticulate joyAnd tears, Alcestis thanked Hyperion,And worshipped.  Then he gently: "Who will die,So that the king may live?"  And she: "You ask?Nay, who will live when life clasps hands with shame,And death with honor?  Lo, you are a god;You cannot know the highest joy of life,--To leave it when 't is worthier to die.His parents, kinsmen, courtiers, subjects, slaves,--For love of him myself would die, were noneFound ready; but what Greek would stand to seeA woman glorified, and falter?  Once,And only once, the gods will do this thingIn all the ages: such a man themselvesDelight to honor,--holy, temperate, chaste,With reverence for his daemon and his god."Thus she triumphant to they very doorOf King Admetus' chamber.  All there sawHer ill-timed gladness with much wonderment.But she: "No longer mourn!  The king is saved:The Fates will spare him.  Lift your voice in praise;Sing paeans to Apollo; crown your browsWith laurel; offer thankful sacrifice!""O Queen, what mean these foolish words misplaced?And what an hour is this to thank the Fates?""Thrice blessed be the gods!--for God himselfHas sued for me,--they are not stern and deaf.Cry, and they answer: commune with your soul,And they send counsel: weep with rainy grief,And these will sweeten you your bitterest tears.On one condition King Admetus lives,And ye, on hearing, will lament no more,Each emulous to save."  Then--for she spakeAssured, as having heard an oracle--They asked: "What deed of ours may serve the king?""The Fates accept another life for his,And one of you may die."  Smiling, she ceased.But silence answered her.  "What! do ye thrustYour arrows in your hearts beneath your cloaks,Dying like Greeks, too proud to own the pang?This ask I not.  In all the populous landBut one need suffer for immortal praise.The generous Fates have sent no pestilence,Famine, nor war: it is as though they gaveFreely, and only make the boon more richBy such slight payment.  Now a people mourns,And ye may change the grief to jubilee,Filling the cities with a pleasant sound.But as for me, what faltering words can tellMy joy, in extreme sharpness kin to pain?A monument you have within my heart,Wreathed with kind love and dear remembrances;And I will pray for you before I cravePardon and pity for myself from God.Your name will be the highest in the land,Oftenest, fondest on my grateful lips,After the name of him you die to save.What! silent still?  Since when has virtue grownLess beautiful than indolence and ease?Is death more terrible, more hateworthy,More bitter than dishonor?  Will ye liveOn shame?  Chew and find sweet its poisoned fruits?What sons will ye bring forth--mean-souled like you,Or, like your parents, brave--to blush like girls,And say,'Our fathers were afraid to die!'Ye will not dare to raise heroic eyesUnto the eyes of aliens.  In the streetsWill women and young children point at youScornfully, and the sun will find you shamed,And night refuse to shield you.  What a lifeIs this ye spin and fashion for yourselves!And what new tortures of suspense and doubtWill death invent for such as are afraid!Acastus, thou my brother, in the fieldForemost, who greeted me with sanguine handsFrom ruddy battle with a conqueror's face,--These honors wilt thou blot with infamy?Nay, thou hast won no honors: a mere girlWould do as much as thou at such a time,In clamorous battle,'midst tumultuous sounds,Neighing of war-steeds, shouts of sharp command,Snapping of shivered spears; for all are braveWhen all men look to them expectantly;But he is truly brave who faces deathWithin his chamber, at a sudden call,At night, when no man sees,--content to dieWhen life can serve no longer those he loves."Then thus Acastus: "Sister, I fear notDeath, nor the empty darkness of the grave,And hold my life but as a little thing,Subject unto my people's call, and Fate.But if 't is little, no greater is the king's;And though my heart bleeds sorely, I recallAstydamia, who thus would mourn for me.We are not cowards, we youth of Thessaly,And Thessaly--yea, all Greece--knoweth it;Nor will we brook the name from even you,Albeit a queen, and uttering these wild wordsThrough your umwonted sorrow."  Then she knewThat he stood firm, and turning from him, criedTo the king's parents: "Are ye deaf with grief,Pheres, Clymene?  Ye can save your son,Yet rather stand and weep with barren tears.O, shame! to think that such gray, reverend hairsShould cover such unvenerable heads!What would ye lose?--a remnant of mere life,A few slight raveled threads, and give him yearsTo fill with glory.  Who, when he is gone,Will call you gentlest names this side of heaven,--Father and mother?  Knew ye not this manEre he was royal,--a poor, helpless child,Crownless and kingdomless?  One birth aloneSufficeth not, Clymene: once againYou must give life with travail and strong pain.Has he not lived to outstrip your swift hopes?What mother can refuse a second birthTo such a son?  But ye denying him,What after-offering may appease the gods?What joy outweigh the grief of this one day?What clamor drown the hours' myriad tongues,Crying, 'Your son, your son? where is your son,Unnatural mother, timid foolish man?"Then Pheres gravely: "These are graceless wordsFrom you our daughter.  Life is always life,And death comes soon enough to such as we.We twain are old and weak, have served our time,And made our sacrifices.  Let the youngArise now in their turn and save the king.""O gods! look on your creatures! do ye see?And seeing, have ye patience?  Smite them all,Unsparing, with dishonorable death.Vile slaves! a woman teaches you to die.Intrepid, with exalted steadfast soul,Scorn in my heart, and love unutterable,I yield the Fates my life, and like a godCommand them to revere that sacred head.Thus kiss I thrice the dear, blind, holy eyes,And bid them see; and thrice I kiss this brow,And thus unfasten I the pale, proud lipsWith fruitful kissings, bringing love and life,And without fear or any pang, I breatheMy soul in him."                     "Alcestis, I awake.I hear, I hear--unspeak thy reckless words!For, lo! thy life-blood tingles in my veins,And streameth through my body like new wine.Behold! thy spirit dedicate revivesMy pulse, and through thy sacrifice I breathe.Thy lips are bloodless: kiss me not again.Ashen thy cheeks, faded thy flower-like hands.O woman! perfect in thy womanhoodAnd in thy wifehood, I adjure thee nowAs mother, by the love thou bearest our child,In this thy hour of passion and of love,Of sacrifice and sorrow, to unsayThy words sublime!"  "I die that thou mayest live.""And deemest thou that I accept the boon,Craven, like these my subjects?  Lo, my queen,Is life itself a lovely thing,--bare life?And empty breath a thing desirable?Or is it rather happiness and loveThat make it precious to its inmost core?When these are lost, are there not swords in Greece,And flame and poison, deadly waves and plagues?No man has ever lacked these things and goneUnsatisfied.  It is not these the gods refuse(Nay, never clutch my sleeve and raise thy lip),--Not these I seek; but I will stab myself,Poison my life and burn my flesh, with words,And save or follow thee.  Lo! hearken now:I bid the gods take back their loathsome gifts:O spurn them, and I scorn them, and I hate.Will they prove deaf to this as to my prayers?With tongue reviling, blasphemous, I curse,With mouth polluted from deliberate heart.Dishonored be their names, scorned be their priests,Ruined their altars, mocked their oracles!It is Admetus, King of Thessaly,Defaming thus: annihilate him, gods!So that his queen, who worships you, may live."He paused as one expectant; but no boltFrom the insulted heavens answered him,But awful silence followed.  Then a hand,A boyish hand, upon his shoulder fell,And turning, he beheld his shepherd boy,Not wrathful, but divinely pitiful,Who spake in tender, thrilling tones: "The godsCannot recall their gifts.  Blaspheme them not:Bow down and worship rather.  Shall he curseWho sees not, and who hears not,--neither knowsNor understands?  Nay, thou shalt bless and pray,--Pray, for the pure heart purged by prayer, divinesAnd seeth when the bolder eyes are blind.Worship and wonder,--these befit a manAt every hour; and mayhap will the godsYet work a miracle for knees that bendAnd hands that supplicate."                              Then all they knewA sudden sense of awe, and bowed their headsBeneath the stripling's gaze: Admetus fell,Crushed by that gentle touch, and cried aloud:"Pardon and pity! I am hard beset."          ______________________  There waited at the doorway of the kingOne grim and ghastly, shadowy, horrible,Bearing the likeness of a king himself,Erect as one who serveth not,--uponHis head a crown, within his fleshless handsA sceptre,--monstrous, winged, intolerable.To him a stranger coming 'neath the trees,Which slid down flakes of light, now on his hair,Close-curled, now on his bared and brawny chest,Now on his flexile, vine-like veined limbs,With iron network of strong muscle thewed,And godlike brows and proud mouth unrelaxed.Firm was his step; no superfluityOf indolent flesh impeded this man's strength.Slender and supple every perfect limb,Beautiful with the glory of a man.No weapons bare he, neither shield: his handsFolded upon his breast, his movements freeOf all incumbrance.  When his mighty stridesHad brought him nigh the waiting one, he paused:"Whose palace this? and who art thou, grim shade?""The palace of the King of Thessaly,And my name is not strange unto thine ears;For who hath told men that I wait for them,The one sure thing on earth?  Yet all they know,Unasking and yet answered.  I am Death,The only secret that the gods reveal.But who are thou who darest question me?""Alcides; and that thing I dare not doHath found no name.  Whom here awaitest thou?""Alcestis, Queen of Thessaly,--a queenWho wooed me as the bridegroom woos the bride,For her life sacrificed will save her lordAdmetus, as the Fates decreed.  I waitImpatient, eager; and I enter soon,With darkening wing, invisible, a god,And kiss her lips, and kiss her throbbing heart,And then the tenderest hands can do no moreThan close her eyes and wipe her cold, white brow,Inurn her ashes and strew flowers above.""This woman is a god, a hero, Death.In this her sacrifice I see a soulLuminous, starry: earth can spare her not:It is not rich enough in purityTo lose this paragon.  Save her, O Death!Thou surely art more gentle than the Fates,Yet these have spared her lord, and never meantThat she should suffer, and that this their grace,Beautiful, royal on one side, should turnSudden and show a fearful, fatal face.""Nay, have they not?  O fond and foolish man,Naught comes unlooked for, unforeseen by them.Doubt when they favor thee, though thou mayest laughWhen they have scourged thee with an iron scourge.Behold, their smile is deadlier than their sting,And every boon of theirs is double-faced.Yea, I am gentler unto ye than these:I slay relentless, but when have I mockedWith poisoned gifts, and generous hands that smiteUnder the flowers? for my name is Truth.Were this fair queen more fair, more pure, more chaste,I would not spare her for your wildest prayerNor her best virtue.  Is the earth's mouth full?Is the grave satisfied?  Discrown me then,For life is lord, and men may mock the godsWith immortality."  "I sue no more,But I command thee spare this woman's life,Or wrestle with Alcides."  "Wrestle with thee,Thou puny boy!"  And Death laughed loud, and swelledTo monstrous bulk, fierce-eyed, with outstretched wings,And lightnings round his brow; but grave and firm,Strong as a tower, Alcides waited him,And these began to wrestle, and a cloudImpenetrable fell, and all was dark.         ______________________  "Farewell, Admetus and my little son,Eumelus,--O these clinging baby hands!Thy loss is bitter, for no chance, no fame,No wealth of love, can ever compensatefor a dead mother.  Thou, O king, fulfillThe double duty: love him with my love,And make him bold to wrestle, shiver spears,Noble and manly, Grecian to the bone;And tell him that his mother spake with gods.Farewell, farewell!  Mine eyes are growing blind:The darkness gathers.  O my heart, my heart!"No sound made answer save the cries of griefFrom all the mourners, and the supplianceOf strick'n Admetus: "O have mercy, gods!O gods, have mercy, mercy upon us!"Then from the dying woman's couch againHer voice was heard, but with strange sudden tones:"Lo, I awake--the light comes back to me.What miracle is this?"  And thunders shookThe air, and clouds of mighty darkness fell,And the earth trembled, and weird, horrid soundsWere heard of rushing wings and fleeing feet,And groans; and all were silent, dumb with awe,Saving the king, who paused not in his prayer:"Have mercy, gods!" and then again, "O gods,Have mercy!"              Through the open casement pouredBright floods of sunny light; the air was soft,Clear, delicate as though a summer stormHad passed away; and those there standing saw,Afar upon the plain, Death fleeing thence,And at the doorway, weary, well-nigh spent,Alcides, flushed with victory.               TANNHAUSER.         To my mother.  May, 1870.The Landgrave Hermann held a gatheringOf minstrels, minnesingers, troubadours,At Wartburg in his palace, and the knight,Sir Tannhauser of France, the greatest bard,Inspired with heavenly visions, and endowedWith apprehension and rare utteranceOf noble music, fared in thoughtful wiseAcross the Horsel meadows.  Full of light,And large repose, the peaceful valley lay,In the late splendor of the afternoon,And level sunbeams lit the serious faceOf the young knight, who journeyed to the west,Towards the precipitous and rugged cliffs,Scarred, grim, and torn with savage rifts and chasms,That in the distance loomed as soft and fairAnd purple as their shadows on the grass.The tinkling chimes ran out athwart the air,Proclaiming sunset, ushering evening in,Although the sky yet glowed with yellow light.The ploughboy, ere he led his cattle home,In the near meadow, reverently knelt,And doffed his cap, and duly crossed his breast,Whispering his "Ave Mary," as he heardThe pealing vesper-bell.  But still the knight,Unmindful of the sacred hour announced,Disdainful or unconscious, held his course."Would that I also, like yon stupid wight,Could kneel and hail the Virgin and believe!"He murmured bitterly beneath his breath."Were I a pagan, riding to contendFor the Olympic wreath, O with what zeal,What fire of inspiration, would I singThe praises of the gods!  How may my lyreGlorify these whose very life I doubt?The world is governed by one cruel God,Who brings a sword, not peace.  A pallid Christ,Unnatural, perfect, and a virgin cold,They give us for a heaven of living gods,Beautiful, loving, whose mere names were song;A creed of suffering and despair, walled inOn every side by brazen boundaries,That limit the soul's vision and her hopeTo a red hell or and unpeopled heaven.Yea, I am lost already,--even nowAm doomed to flaming torture for my thoughts.O gods! O gods! where shall my soul find peace?"He raised his wan face to the faded skies,Now shadowing into twilight; no responseCame from their sunless heights; no miracle,As in the ancient days of answering gods.With a long, shuddering sigh he glanced to earth,Finding himself among the Horsel cliffs.Gray, sullen, gaunt, they towered on either side;Scant shrubs sucked meagre life between the riftsOf their huge crags, and made small darker spotsUpon their wrinkled sides; the jaded horseStumbled upon loose, rattling, fallen stones,Amidst the gathering dusk, and blindly faredThrough the weird, perilous pass.  As darkness waxed,And an oppressive mystery enwrappedThe roadstead and the rocks, Sir TannhauserFancied he saw upon the mountain-sideThe fluttering of white raiment.  With a senseOf wild joy and horror, he gave pause,For his sagacious horse that reeked of sweat,Trembling in every limb, confirmed his thought,That nothing human scaled that haunted cliff.The white thing seemed descending,--now a cloudIt looked, and now a rag of drifted mist,Torn in the jagged gorge precipitous,And now an apparition clad in white,Shapely and real,--then he lost it quite,Gazing on nothing with blank, foolish face.As with wide eyes he stood, he was awareOf a strange splendor at his very side,A presence and a majesty so great,That ere he saw, he felt it was divine.He turned, and, leaping from his horse, fell prone,In speechless adoration, on the earth,Before the matchless goddess, who appearedWith no less freshness of immortal youthThan when first risen from foam of Paphian seas.He heard delicious strains of melody,Such as his highest muse had ne'er attained,Float in the air, while in the distance rang,Harsh and discordant, jarring with those tones,The gallop of his frightened horse's hoofs,Clattering in sudden freedom down the pass.A voice that made all music dissonanceThen thrilled through heart and flesh of that prone knight,Triumphantly: "The gods need but appear,And their usurped thrones are theirs again!"Then tenderly: "Sweet knight, I pray thee, rise;Worship me not, for I desire thy love.Look on me, follow me, for I am fainOf thy fair, human face."  He rose and looked,Stirred by that heavenly flattery to the soul.Her hair, unbraided and unfilleted,Rained in a glittering shower to the ground,And cast forth lustre.  Round her zone was claspedThe scintillant cestus, stiff with flaming gold,Thicker with restless gems than heaven with stars.She might have flung the enchanted wonder forth;Her eyes, her slightest gesture would sufficeTo bind all men in blissful slavery.She sprang upon the mountain's dangerous side,With feet that left their print in flowers divine,--Flushed amaryllis and blue hyacinth,Impurpled amaranth and asphodel,Dewy with nectar, and exhaling scentsRicher than all the roses of mid-June.The knight sped after her, with wild eyes fixedUpon her brightness, as she lightly leaptFrom crag to crag, with flying auburn hair,Like a gold cloud, that lured him ever on,Higher and higher up the haunted cliff.At last amidst a grove of pines she paused,Until he reached her, breathing hard with haste,Delight, and wonder.  Then upon his handShe placed her own, and all his blood at onceTingled and hotly rushed to brow and cheek,At the supreme caress; but the mere touchInfused fresh life, and when she looked at himWith gracious tenderness, he felt himselfStrong suddenly to bear the blinding lightOf those great eyes.  "Dear knight," she murmured low,"For love of me, wilt thou accord this boon,--To grace my weary home in banishment?"His hungry eyes gave answer ere he spoke,In tones abrupt that startled his own earsWith their strange harshness; but with thanks profuseShe guided him, still holding his cold handIn her warm, dainty palm, unto a cave,Whence a rare glory issued, and a smellOf spice and roses, frankincense and balm.They entering stood within a marble hall,With straight, slim pillars, at whose farther endThe goddess led him to a spiral flightOf stairs, descending always 'midst black gloomInto the very bowels of the earth.Down these, with fearful swiftness, they made way,The knight's feet touching not the solid stair,But sliding down as in a vexing dream,Blind, feeling but that hand divine that stillEmpowered him to walk on empty air.Then he was dazzled by a sudden blaze,In vast palace filled with reveling folk.Cunningly pictured on the ivory wallsWere rolling hills, cool lakes, and boscage green,And all the summer landscape's various pomp.The precious canopy aloft was carvedIn semblance of the pleached forest trees,Enameled with the liveliest green, wherethroughA light pierced, more resplendent than the day.O'er the pale, polished jasper of the floorOf burnished metal, fretted and embossedWith all the marvelous story of her birthPainted in prodigal splendor of rich tincts,And carved by heavenly artists,--crystal seas,And long-haired Nereids in their pearly shells,And all the wonder of her lucent limbsSphered in a vermeil mist.  Upon the throneShe took her seat, the knight beside her still,Singing on couches of fresh asphodel,And the dance ceased, and the flushed revelers cameIn glittering phalanx to adore their queen.Beautiful girls, with shining delicate heads,Crested with living jewels, fanned the airWith flickering wings from naked shoulders soft.Then with preluding low, a thousand harps,And citherns, and strange nameless instruments,Sent through the fragrant air sweet symphonies,And the winged dancers waved in mazy rounds,With changing lustres like a summer sea.Fair boys, with charming yellow hair crisp-curled,And frail, effeminate beauty, the knight saw,But of strong, stalwart men like him were none.He gazed thereon bewitched, until the handOf Venus, erst withdrawn, now fell againUpon his own, and roused him from his trance.He looked on her, and as he looked, a cloudAuroral, flaming as at sunrising,Arose from nothing, floating over themIn luminous folds, like that vermilion mistPenciled upon the throne, and as it waxedIn density and brightness, all the throngOf festal dancers, less and less distinct,Grew like pale spirits in a vague, dim dream,And vanished altogether; and these twain,Shut from the world in that ambrosial cloud,Now with a glory inconceivable,Vivid and conflagrant, looked each on each.  All hours came laden with their own delightsIn that enchanted place, wherein TimeKnew no divisions harsh of night and day,But light was always, and desire of sleepWas satisfied at once with slumber soft,Desire of food with magical repast,By unseen hands on golden tables spread.But these the knight accepted like a god,All less was lost in that excess of joy,The crowning marvel of her love for him,Assuring him of his divinity.Meanwhile remembrance of the earth appearedLike the vague trouble of a transient dream,--The doubt, the scruples, the remorse for thoughtsBeyond his own control, the constant thirstFor something fairer than his life, more realThan airy revelations of his Muse.Here was his soul's desire satisfied.All nobler passions died; his lyre he flungRecklessly forth, with vows to dedicateHis being to herself.  She knew and seizedThe moment of her mastery, and conveyedThe lyre beyond his sight and memory.With blandishment divine she changed for him,Each hour, her mood; a very woman now,Fantastic, voluble, affectionate,And jealous of the vague, unbodied air,Exacting, penitent, and pacified,All in a breath.  And often she appearedMajestic with celestial wrath, with eyesThat shot forth fire, and a heavy brow,Portentous as the lowering front of heaven,When the reverberant, sullen thunder rollsAmong the echoing clouds.  Thus she denouncedHer ancient, fickle worshippers, who leftHer altars desecrate, her fires unfed,Her name forgotten.  "But I reign, I reign!"She would shrill forth, triumphant; "yea, I reign.Men name me not, but worship me unnamed,Beauty and Love within their heart of hearts;Not with bent knees and empty breath of words,But with devoted sacrifice of lives."Then melting in a moment, she would weepAmbrosial tears, pathetic, full of guile,Accusing her own base ingratitude,In craving worship, when she had his heart,Her priceless knight, her peerless paladin,Her Tannhauser; then, with an artful glanceOf lovely helplessness, entreated himNot to desert her, like the faithless world,For these unbeautiful and barbarous gods,Or she would never cease her prayers to Jove,Until he took from her the heavy curseOf immortality.  With closer vows,The knight then sealed his worship and forsworeAll other aims and deeds to serve her cause.Thus passed unnoted seven barren yearsOf reckless passion and voluptuous sloth,Undignified by any lofty thoughtIn his degraded mind, that sometime wasEndowed with noble capability.From revelry to revelry he passed,Craving more pungent pleasure momently,And new intoxications, and each hourThe siren goddess answered his desires.Once when she left him with a weary senseOf utter lassitude, he sat alone,And, raising listless eyes, he saw himselfIn a great burnished mirror, wrought aboutWith cunning imagery of twisted vines.He scarcely knew those sunken, red-rimmed eyes,For his who in the flush of manhood rodeAmong the cliffs, and followed up the cragsThe flying temptress; and there fell on himA horror of her beauty, a disgustFor his degenerate and corrupted life,With irresistible, intense desire,To feel the breath of heaven on his face.Then as Fate willed, who rules above the gods,He saw, within the glass, behind him glideThe form of Venus.  Certain of her power,She had laid by, in fond security,The enchanted cestus, and Sir Tannhauser,With surfeited regard, beheld her now,No fairer than the women of the earth,Whom with serenity and health he left,Duped by a lovely witch.  Before he moved,She knew her destiny; and when he turned,He seemed to drop a mask, disclosing thusAn alien face, and eyes with vision true,That for long time with glamour had been blind.Hiding the hideous rage within her breast,With girlish simpleness of folded hands,Auroral blushes, and sweet, shamefast mien,She spoke: "Behold, my love, I have cast forthAll magic, blandishments and sorcery,For I have dreamed a dream so terrible,That I awoke to find my pillow stainedWith tears as of real woe.  I thought my belt,By Vulcan wrought with matchless skill and power,Was the sole bond between us; this being doffed,I seemed to thee an old, unlovely crone,Wrinkled by every year that I have seen.Thou turnedst from me with a brutal sneer,So that I woke with weeping.  Then I rose,And drew the glittering girdle from my zone,Jealous thereof, yet full of fears, and said,'If it be this he loves, then let him go!I have no solace as a mortal hath,No hope of change or death to comfort meThrough all eternity; yet he is free,Though I could hold him fast with heavy chains,Bound in perpetual imprisonment.'Tell me my vision was a baseless dream;See, I am kneeling, and kiss thy hands,--In pity, look on me, before thy wordCondemns me to immortal misery!"As she looked down, the infernal influenceWorked on his soul again; for she was fairBeyond imagination, and her browSeemed luminous with high self-sacrifice.He bent and kissed her head, warm, shining, soft,With its close-curling gold, and love revived.But ere he spoke, he heard the distant soundOf one sweet, smitten lyre, and a gleamOf violent anger flashed across the faceUpraised to his in feigned simplicityAnd singleness of purpose.  Then he sprang,Well-nigh a god himself, with sudden strengthto vanquish and resist, beyond her reach,Crying, "My old Muse calls me, and I hear!Thy fateful vision is no baseless dream;I will be gone from this accursed hall!"Then she, too, rose, dilating over him,And sullen clouds veiled all her rosy limbs,Unto her girdle, and her head appearedRefulgent, and her voice rang wrathfully:"Have I cajoled and flattered thee till now,To lose thee thus!  How wilt thou make escape?ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE:Yea, not my love, but my poor slave and fool."But he, with both hands pressed upon his eyes,Against that blinding lustre, heeded notHer thundered words, and cried in sharp despair,"Help me, O Virgin Mary! and thereat,The very bases of the hall gave way,The roof was rived, the goddess disappeared,And Tannhauser stood free upon the cliff,Amidst the morning sunshine and fresh air.  Around him were the tumbled blocks and crags,Huge ridges and sharp juts of flinty peaks,Black caves, and masses of the grim, bald rock.The ethereal, unfathomable sky,Hung over him, the valley lay beneath,Dotted with yellow hayricks, that exhaledSweet, healthy odors to the mountain-top.He breathed intoxicate the infinite air,And plucked the heather blossoms where they blew,Reckless with light and dew, in crannies green,And scarcely saw their darling bells for tears.No sounds of labor reached him from the farmsAnd hamlets trim, nor from the furrowed glebe;But a serene and sabbath stillness reigned,Till broken by the faint, melodious chimesOf the small village church that called to prayer.He hurried down the rugged, scarped cliff,And swung himself from shelving granite slopesTo narrow foot-holds, near wide-throated chasms,Tearing against the sharp stones his bleeding hands,With long hair flying from his dripping brow,Uncovered head, and white, exalted face.No memory had he of his smooth ascent,No thought of fear upon those dreadful hills;He only heard the bell, inviting himTo satisfy the craving of his heart,For worship 'midst his fellow men.  He reachedThe beaten, dusty road, and passed thereonThe pious peasants faring towards the church,And scarce refrained from greeting them like friendsDearly beloved, after long absence met.How more than fair the sunburnt wenches looked,In their rough, homespun gowns and coifs demure,After the beauty of bare, rosy limbs,And odorous, loose hair!  He noted notSuspicious glances on his garb uncouth,His air extravagant and face distraught,With bursts of laughter from the red-cheeked boys,And prudent crossings of the women's breasts.He passed the flowering close about the church,And trod the well worn-path, with throbbing heart,The little heather-bell between his lips,And his eyes fastened on the good green grass.Thus entered he the sanctuary, litWith frequent tapers, and with sunbeams stainedThrough painted glass.  How pure and innocentThe waiting congregation seemed to him,Kneeling, or seated with calm brows upraised!With faltering strength, he cowered down alone,And held sincere communion with the Lord,For one brief moment, in a sudden gushOf blessed tears.  The minister of GodRose to invoke a blessing on his flock,And then began the service,--not in wordsTo raise the lowly, and to heal the sick,But an alien tongue, with phrases formed,And meaningless observances.  The knight,Unmoved, yet thirsting for the simple wordThat might have moved him, held his bitter thoughts,But when in his own speech a new priest spake,Looked up with hope revived, and heard the text:"Go, preach the Gospel unto all the world.He that believes and is baptized, is saved.He that believeth not, is damned in hell!"He sat with neck thrust forth and staring eyes;The crowded congregation disappeared;He felt alone in some black sea of hell,While a great light smote one exalted face,Vivid already with prophetic fire,Whose fatal mouth now thundered forth his doom.He longed in that void circle to cry out,With one clear shriek, but sense and voice seemed bound,And his parched tongue clave useless to his mouth.As the last words resounded through the church,And once again the pastor blessed his flock,Who, serious and subdued, passed slowly downThe arrow aisle, none noted, near the wall,A fallen man with face upon his knees,A heap of huddled garments and loose hair,Unconscious 'mid the rustling, murmurous stir,'Midst light and rural smell of grass and flowers,Let in athwart the doorway.  One lone priest,Darkening the altar lights, moved noiselessly,Now with the yellow glow upon his face,Now a black shadow gliding farther on,Amidst the smooth, slim pillars of hewn ash.But from the vacant aisles he heard at onceA hollow sigh, heaved from a depth profound.Upholding his last light above his head,And peering eagerly amidst the stalls,He cried, "Be blest who cometh in God's name."Then the gaunt form of Tannhauser arose."Father, I am a sinner, and I seekForgiveness and help, by whatso meansI can regain the joy of peace with God.""The Lord hath mercy on the penitent.'Although thy sins be scarlet,' He hath said,'Will I not make them white as wool?'  Confess,And I will shrive you."  Thus the good priest movedTowards the remorseful knight and pressed his hand.But shrinking down, he drew his fingers backFrom the kind palm, and kissed the friar's feet."Thy pure hand is anointed, and can heal.The cool, calm pressure brings back sanity,And what serene, past joys! yet touch me not,My contact is pollution,--hear, O hear,While I disburden my charged soul."  He lay,Casting about for words and strength to speak."O father, is there help for such a one,"In tones of deep abasement he began,"Who hath rebelled against the laws of God,With pride no less presumptuous than hisWho lost thereby his rank in heaven?"  "My son,There is atonement for all sins,--or slightOr difficult, proportioned to the crime.Though this may be the staining of thy handsWith blood of kinsmen or of fellow-men.""My hands are white,--my crime hath found no name,This side of hell; yet though my heart-strings snapTo live it over, let me make the attempt.I was a knight and bard, with such a giftOf revelation that no hour of lifeLacked beauty and adornment, in myselfThe seat and centre of all happiness.What inspiration could my lofty MuseDraw from those common and familiar themes,Painted upon the windows and the wallsOf every church,--the mother and her child,The miracle and mystery of the birth,The death, the resurrection?  Fool and blind!That saw not symbols of eternal truthIn that grand tragedy and victory,Significant and infinite as life.What tortures did my skeptic soul endure,At war against herself and all mankind!The restless nights of feverish sleeplessness,With balancing of reasons nicely weighed;The dawn that brought no hope nor energy,The blasphemous arraignment of the Lord,Taxing His glorious divinityWith all the grief and folly of the world.Then came relapses into abject fear,And hollow prayer and praise from craven heart.Before a sculptured Venus I would kneel,Crown her with flowers, worship her, and cry,'O large and noble type of our ideal,At least my heart and prayer return to thee,Amidst a faithless world of proselytes.Madonna Mary, with her virgin lips,And eyes that look perpetual reproach,Insults and is a blasphemy on youth.Is she to claim the worship of a manHot with the first rich flush of ripened life?'Realities, like phantoms, glided by,Unnoted 'midst the torment and delightsOf my conflicting spirit, and I doffedthe modest Christian weeds of charityAnd fit humility, and steeled myselfIn pagan panoply of stoicismAnd self-sufficing pride.  Yet constantlyI gained men's charmed attention and applause,With the wild strains I smote from out my lyre,To me the native language of my soul,To them attractive and miraculous,As all things whose solution and whose sourceRemain a mystery.  Then came suddenlyThe summons to attend the gatheringOf minstrels at the Landgrave Hermann's court.Resolved to publish there my pagan creedIn harmonies so high and beautifulThat all the world would share my zeal and faith,I journeyed towards the haunted Horsel cliffs.O God! how may I tell you how SHE came,The temptress of a hundred centuries,Yet fresh as April?  She bewitched my sense,Poisoned my judgment with sweet flatteries,And for I may not guess how many yearsHeld me a captive in degrading bonds.There is no sin of lust so lewd and foul,Which I learned not in that alluring hell,Until this morn, I snapped the ignoble tie,By calling on the Mother of our Lord.O for the power to stand again erect,And look men in the eyes!  What penitence,What scourging of the flesh, what rigid fasts,What terrible privations may sufficeTo cleanse me in the sight of God and man?"Ill-omened silence followed his appeal.Patient and motionless he lay awhile,Then sprang unto his feet with sudden force,Confronting in his breathless vehemence,With palpitating heart, the timid priest."Answer me, as you hope for a response,One day, at the great judgment seat yourself.""I cannot answer," said the timid priest,"I have not understood."  "Just God! is thisThe curse Thou layest upon me?  I outstripThe sympathy and brotherhood of men,So far removed is my experienceFrom their clean innocence.  Inspire me,Prompt me to words that bring me near to them!Father," in gentler accents he resumed,"Thank Heaven at your every orisonThat sin like mine you cannot apprehend.More than the truth perchance I have confessed,But I have sinned, and darkly,--this is true;And I have suffered, and am suffering now.Is there no help in your great Christian creedOf liberal charity, for such a one?""My son," the priest replied, "your speech distraughtHath quite bewildered me.  I fain would hopeThat Christ's large charity can reach your sin,But I know naught.  I cannot but believeThat the enchantress who first tempted youMust be the Evil one,--your early doubtWas the possession of your soul by him.Travel across the mountain to the town,The first cathedral town upon the roadThat leads to Rome,--a sage and reverend priest,The Bishop Adrian, bides there.  Say you have comeFrom his leal servant, Friar Lodovick;He hath vast lore and great authority,And may absolve you freely of your sin."  Over the rolling hills, through summer fields,By noisy villages and lonely lanes,Through glowing days, when all the landscape stretchedShimmering in the heat, a pilgrim faredTowards the cathedral town.  Sir TannhauserHad donned the mournful sackcloth, girt his loinsWith a coarse rope that ate into his flesh,Muffled a cowl about his shaven head,Hung a great leaden cross around his neck;And bearing in his hands a knotty staff,With swollen, sandaled feet he held his course.He snatched scant rest at twilight or at dawn,When his forced travel was least difficult.But most he journeyed when the sky, o'ercast,Uprolled its threatening clouds of dusky blue,And angry thunder grumbled through the hills,And earth grew dark at noonday, till the flashOf the thin lightning through the wide sky leapt.And tumbling showers scoured along the plain.Then folk who saw the pilgrim penitent,Drenched, weird, and hastening as as to some strange doom,Swore that the wandering Jew had crossed their land,And the Lord Christ had sent the deadly boltHarmless upon his cursed, immortal head.At length the hill-side city's spires and roofs,With all its western windows smitten redBy a rich sunset, and with massive towersOf its cathedral overtopping all,greeted his sight.  Some weary paces more,And as the twilight deepened in the streets,He stood within the minster.  How serene,In sculptured calm of centuries, it seemed!How cool and spacious all the dim-lit aisles,Still hazy with fumes of frankincense!The vesper had been said, yet here and thereA wrinkled beldam, or mourner veiled,Or burly burgher on the cold floor knelt,And still the organist, with wandering hands,Drew from the keys mysterious melodies,And filled the church with flying waifs of song,That with ethereal beauty moved the soulTo a more tender prayer and gentler faithThan choral anthems and the solemn mass.A thousand memories, sweet to bitterness,Rushed on the knight and filled his eyes with tears;Youth's blamelessness and faith forever lost,The love of his neglected lyre, his art,Revived by these aerial harmonies.He was unworthy now to touch the strings,Too base to stir men's soul to ecstasyAnd high resolves, as in the days agone;And yet, with all his spirit's earnestness,He yearned to feel the lyre between his hands,To utter all the trouble of his lifeUnto the Muse who understands and helps.Outworn with travel, soothed to drowsinessBy dying music and sweet-scented air,His limbs relaxed, and sleep possessed his frame.Auroral light the eastern oriels touched,When with delicious sense of rest he woke,Amidst the cast and silent empty aisles."God's peace hath fallen upon me in this place;This is my Bethel; here I feel againA holy calm, if not of innocence,Yet purest after that, the calm sereneOf expiation and forgiveness."He spake, and passed with staff and wallet forthThrough the tall portal to the open square,And turning, paused to look upon the pile.The northern front against the crystal skyLoomed dark and heavy, full of sombre shade,With each projecting buttress, carven cross,Gable and mullion, tipped with laughing lightBy the slant sunbeams of the risen morn.The noisy swallows wheeled above their nests,Builded in hidden nooks about the porch.No human life was stirring in the square,Save now and then a rumbling market-team,Fresh from the fields and farms without the town.He knelt upon the broad cathedral steps,And kissed the moistened stone, while overheadThe circling swallows sang, and all aroundThe mighty city lay asleep and still.  To stranger's ears must yet again be madeThe terrible confession; yet againA deathly chill, with something worse than fear,Seized the knight's heart, who knew his every wordWidened the gulf between his kind and him.The Bishop sat with pomp of mitred head,In pride of proven virtue, hearkening to allWith cold, official apathy, nor madeA sign of pity nor encouragement.The friar understood the pilgrim's grief,The language of his eyes; his speech aloneWas alien to these kind, untutored ears.But this was truly to be misconstrued,To tear each palpitating word aliveFrom out the depths of his remorseful soul,And have it weighed with the precision coolAnd the nice logic of a reasoning mind.This spiritual Father judged his crimeAs the mad mischief of a reckless boy,That call for strict, immediate punishment.But Tannhauser, who felt himself a man,Though base, yet fallen through passions and rare giftsOf an exuberant nature rankly rich,And knew his weary head was growing grayWith a life's terrible experience,Found his old sense of proper worth revive;But modestly he ended: "Yet I felt,O holy Father, in the church, this morn,A strange security, a peace serene,As though e'en yet the Lord regarded meWith merciful compassion; yea, as thoughEven so vile a worm as I might workMine own salvation, through repentant prayers.""Presumptuous man, it is no easy taskTo expiate such sin; a space of prayerThat deprecates the anger of the Lord,A pilgrimage through pleasant summer lands,May not atone for years of impious lust;Thy heart hath lied to thee in offering hope.""Is there no hope on earth?" the pilgrim sighed."None through thy penance," said the saintly man."Yet there may be through mediation, help.There is a man who by a blameless lifeHath won the right to intercede with God.No sins of his own flesh hath he to purge,--The Cardinal Filippo,--he abides,Within the Holy City.  Seek him out;This is my only counsel,--through thyselfCan be no help and no forgiveness."  How different from the buoyant joy of mornWas this discouraged sense of lassitude,The Bishop's words were ringing in his ears,Measured and pitiless, and blent with these,The memory of the goddess' last wild cry,--"ONCE BEING MINE, THOU ART FOREVER MINE."Was it the truth, despite his penitence,And the dedication of his thought to God,That still some portion of himself was hers,Some lust survived, some criminal regret,For her corrupted love?  He searched his heart:All was remorse, religious and sincere,And yet her dreadful curse still haunted him;For all men shunned him, and denied him help,Knowing at once in looking on his face,Ploughed with deep lines and prematurely old,That he had struggled with some deadly fiend,And that he was no longer kin to them.Just past the outskirts of the town, he stopped,To strengthen will and courage to proceed.The storm had broken o'er the sultry streets,But now the lessening clouds were flying east,And though the gentle shower still wet his face,The west was cloudless while the sun went down,And the bright seven-colored arch stood forth,Against the opposite dull gray.  There wasA beauty in the mingled storm and peace,Beyond clear sunshine, as the vast, green fieldsBasked in soft light, though glistening yet with rain.The roar of all the town was now a buzzLess than the insects' drowsy murmuringThat whirred their gauzy wings around his head.The breeze that follows on the sunsettingWas blowing whiffs of bruised and dripping grassInto the heated city.  But he stood,Disconsolate with thoughts of fate and sin,Still wrestling with his soul to win it backFrom her who claimed it to eternity.Then on the delicate air there came to himThe intonation of the minster bells,Chiming the vespers, musical and faint.He knew not what of dear and beautifulThere was in those familiar peals, that spakeOf his first boyhood and his innocence,Leading him back, with gracious influence,To pleasant thoughts and tender memories,And last, recalling the fair hour of hopeHe passed that morning in the church.  Again,The glad assurance of God's boundless loveFilled all his being, and he rose serene,And journeyed forward with a calm content.  Southward he wended, and the landscape tookA warmer tone, the sky a richer light.The gardens of the graceful, festooned with hops,With their slight tendrils binding pole to pole,Gave place to orchards and the trellised grape,The hedges were enwreathed with trailing vines,With clustering, shapely bunches, 'midst the growthOf tangled greenery.  The elm and ashLess frequent grew than cactus, cypresses,And golden-fruited or large-blossomed trees.The far hills took the hue of the dove's breast,Veiled in gray mist of olive groves.  No moreHe passed dark, moated strongholds of grim knights,But terraces with marble-paven steps,With fountains leaping in the sunny air,And hanging gardens full of sumptuous bloom.Then cloisters guarded by their dead gray walls,Where now and then a golden globe of fruitOr full-flushed flower peered out upon the road,Nodding against the stone, and where he heardSometimes the voices of the chanting monks,Sometimes the laugh of children at their play,Amidst the quaint, old gardens.  But these sightsWere in the suburbs of the wealthy towns.For many a day through wildernesses rank,Or marshy, feverous meadow-lands he fared,The fierce sun smiting his close-muffled head;Or 'midst the Alpine gorges faced the storm,That drave adown the gullies melted snowAnd clattering boulders from the mountain-tops.At times, between the mountains and the seaFair prospects opened, with the boundless stretchOf restless, tideless water by his side,And their long wash upon the yellow sand.Beneath this generous sky the country-folkCould lead a freer life,--the fat, green fieldsOffered rich pasturage, athwart the airRang tinkling cow-bells and the shepherds' pipes.The knight met many a strolling troubadour,Bearing his cithern, flute, or dulcimer;And oft beneath some castle's balcony,At night, he heard their mellow voices rise,Blent with stringed instruments or tambourines,Chanting some lay as natural as a bird's.Then Nature stole with healthy influenceInto his thoughts; his love of beauty woke,His Muse inspired dreams as in the past.But after this came crueler remorse,And he would tighten round his loins the rope,And lie for hours beside some wayside cross,And feel himself unworthy to enjoyThe splendid gift and privilege of life.Then forth he hurried, spurred by his desireTo reach the City of the Seven Hills,And gain his absolution.  Some leagues moreWould bring him to the vast Campagna land,When by a roadside well he paused to rest.'T was noon, and reapers in the field hard byLay neath the trees upon the sun-scorched grass.But from their midst one came towards the well,Not trudging like a man forespent with toil,But frisking like a child at holiday,With light steps.  The pilgrim watched him come,And found him scarcely older than a child,A large-mouthed earthen pitcher in his hand,And a guitar upon his shoulder slung.A wide straw hat threw all his face in shade,But doffing this, to catch whatever breezeMight stir among the branches, he disclosedA charming head of rippled, auburn hair,A frank, fair face, as lovely as a girls,With great, soft eyes, as mild and grave as kine's.Above his head he slipped the instrument,And laid it with his hat upon the turf,Lowered his pitcher down the well-head cool,And drew it dripping upward, ere he sawThe watchful pilgrim, craving (as he thought)The precious draught.  "Your pardon, holy sir,Drink first," he cried, "before I take the jarUnto my father in the reaping-field."Touched by the cordial kindness of the lad,The pilgrim answered,--"Thanks, my thirst is quenchedFrom mine own palm."  The stranger deftly poisedThe brimming pitcher on his head, and turnedBack to the reaping-folk, while TannhauserLooked after him across the sunny fields,Clasping each hand about his waist to bearThe balanced pitcher; then, down glancing, foundThe lad's guitar near by, and fell at onceTo striking its tuned string with wandering hands,And pensive eyes filled full of tender dreams."Yea, holy sir, it is a worthless thing,And yet I love it, for I make it speak."The boy again stood by him and dispelledHis train of fantasies half sweet, half sad."That was not in my thought," the knight replied."Its worth is more than rubies; whoso hathThe art to make this speak is raised therebyAbove all loneliness or grief or fear."More to himself than to the lad he spake,Who, understanding not, stood doubtfullyAt a loss for answer; but the knight went on:"How came it in your hands, and who hath tunedyour voice to follow it."  "I am unskilled,Good father, but my mother smote its stringsTo music rare."  Diverted from one theme,Pleased with the winsome candor of the boy,The knight encouraged him to confidence;Then his own gift of minstrelsy revealed,And told bright tales of his first wanderings,When in lords' castles and kings' palacesMen still made place for him, for in his landThe gift was rare and valued at its worth,And brought great victory and sounding fame.Thus, in retracing all his pleasant youth,His suffering passed as though it had not been.Wide-eyed and open-mouthed the boy gave ear,His fair face flushing with the sudden thoughtsThat went and came,--then, as the pilgrim ceased,Drew breath and spake: "And where now is your lyre?"The knight with both hands hid his changed, white face,Crying aloud, "Lost! lost! forever lost!"Then, gathering strength, he bared his face againUnto the frightened, wondering boy, and roseWith hasty fear.  "Ah, child, you bring me backUnwitting to remembrance of my grief,For which I donned eternal garb of woe;And yet I owe you thanks for one sweet hourOf healthy human intercourse and peace.'T is not for me to tarry by the way.Farewell!"  The impetuous, remorseful boy,Seeing sharp pain on that kind countenance,Fell at his feet and cried, "Forgive my words,Witless but innocent, and leave me notWithout a blessing."  Moved unutterably,The pilgrim kissed with trembling lips his head,And muttered, "At this moment would to GodThat I were worthy!"  Then waved wasted handsOver the youth in act of blessing him,But faltered, "Cleanse me through his innocence,O heavenly Father!" and with quickening stepsHastened away upon the road to Rome.The noon was past, the reapers drew broad swathsWith scythes sun-smitten 'midst the ripened crop.Thin shadows of the afternoon slept softOn the green meadows as the knight passed forth.  He trudged amidst the sea of poisonous flowersOn the Campagna's undulating plain,With Rome, the many-steepled, many-towered,Before him regnant on her throne of hills.A thick blue cloud of haze o'erhung the town,But the fast-sinking sun struck fiery lightFrom shining crosses, roofs, and flashing domes.Across his path an arching bridge of stoneWas raised above a shrunken yellow stream,Hurrying with the light on every waveTowards the great town and outward to the sea.Upon the bridge's crest he paused, and leanedAgainst the barrier, throwing back his cowl,And gazed upon the dull, unlovely floodThat was the Tiber.  Quaggy banks lay bare,Muddy and miry, glittering in the sun,And myriad insects hovered o'er the reeds,Whose lithe, moist tips by listless airs were stirred.When the low sun had dropped behind the hills,He found himself within the streets of Rome,Walking as in a sleep, where naught seemed real.The chattering hubbub of the market-placeWas over now; but voices smote his earOf garrulous citizens who jostled past.Loud cries, gay laughter, snatches of sweet song,The tinkling fountains set in gardens coolAbout the pillared palaces, and blentWith trickling of the conduits in the squares,The noisy teams within the narrow streets,--All these the stranger heard and did not hear,While ringing bells pealed out above the town,And calm gray twilight skies stretched over it.Wide open stood the doors of every church,And through the porches pressed a streaming throng.Vague wonderment perplexed him, at the sightOf broken columns raised to JupiterBeside the cross, immense cathedrals rearedUpon a dead faith's ruins; all the whirlAnd eager bustle of the living townFilling the storied streets, whose very stonesWere solemn monuments, and spake of death.Although he wrestled with himself, the thoughtOf that poor, past religion smote his heartWith a huge pity and deep sympathy,Beyond the fervor which the Church inspired.Where was the noble race who ruled the world,Moulded of purest elements, and stuffedWith sternest virtues, every man a king,Wearing the purple native in his heart?These lounging beggars, stealthy monks and priests,And womanish patricians filled their place.Thus Tannhauser, still half an infidel,Pagan through mind and Christian through the heart,Fared thoughtfully with wandering, aimless steps,Till in the dying glimmer of the dayHe raised his eyes and found himself aloneAmid the ruined arches, broken shafts,And huge arena of the Coliseum.He did not see it as it was, dim-litBy something less than day and more than night,With wan reflections of the rising moonRather divined than seen on ivied walls,And crumbled battlements, and topless columns--But by the light of all the ancient days,Ringed with keen eager faces, living eyes,Fixed on the circus with a savage joy,Where brandished swords flashed white, and human bloodStreamed o'er the thirsty dust, and Death was king.He started, shuddering, and drew breath to seeThe foul pit choked with weeds and tumbled stones,The cross raised midmost, and the peaceful moonShining o'er all; and fell upon his knees,Restored to faith in one wise, loving God.Day followed day, and still he bode in Rome,Waiting his audience with the Cardinal,And from the gates, on pretext frivolous,Passed daily forth,--his Eminency slept,--Again, his Eminency was fatiguedBy tedious sessions of the Papal court,And thus the patient pilgrim was referredUnto a later hour.  At last the pageBore him a missive with Filippo's seal,That in his name commended TannhauserUnto the Pope.  The worn, discouraged knightRead the brief scroll, then sadly forth again,Along the bosky alleys of the park,Passed to the glare and noise of summer streets."Good God!" he muttered, "Thou hast ears for all,And sendest help and comfort; yet these men,Thy saintly ministers, must deck themselvesWith arrogance, and from their large delightIn all the beauty of the beauteous earth,And peace of indolent, untempted souls,Deny the hungry outcast a bare word."Yet even as he nourished bitter thoughts,He felt a depth of clear serenity,Unruffled in his heart beneath it all.No outward object now had farther powerTo wound him there, for the brooding o'er those deepsOf vast contrition was boundless hope.  Yet not to leave a human chance untried,He sought the absolution of the Pope.In a great hall with airy galleries,Thronged with high dignitaries of the Church,He took his seat amidst the humblest friars.Through open windows came sweet garden smells,Bright morning light, and twittered song of birds.Around the hall flashed gold and sunlit gems,And splendid wealth of color,--white-stoled priests,And scarlet cardinals, and bishops cladIn violet vestments,--while beneath the shadeOf the high gallery huddled dusky shapes,With faded, travel-tattered, sombre smocks,And shaven heads, and girdles of coarse hemp;Some, pilgrims penitent like Tannhauser;Some, devotees to kiss the sacred feet.The brassy blare of trumpets smote the air,Shrill pipes and horns with swelling clamor came,And through the doorway's wide-stretched tapestriesPassed the Pope's trumpeters and mace-bearers,His vergers bearing slender silver wands,Then mitred bishops, red-clad cardinals,The stalwart Papal Guard with halberds raised,And then, with white head crowned with gold ingemmed,The vicar of the lowly Galilean,Holding his pastoral rod of smooth-hewn wood,With censer swung before and peacock fansWaved constantly by pages, either side.Attended thus, they bore him to his throne,And priests and laymen fell upon their knees.Then, after pause of brief and silent prayer,The pilgrims singly through the hall defiled,To kiss the borders of the papal skirts,Smiting their foreheads on the paven stone;Some silent, abject, some accusing themOf venial sins in accents of remorse,Craving his grace, and passing pardoned forth.Sir Tannhauser came last, no need for himTo cry "Peccavi," and crook suppliant knees.His gray head rather crushed than bowed, his faceLivid and wasted, his deep thoughtful eyes,His tall gaunt form in those unseemly weeds,Spake more than eloquence.  His hollow voiceBrake silence, saying, "I am Tannhauser.For seven years I lived apart from men,Within the Venusberg."  A horror seizedThe assembled folk; some turbulently rose;Some clamored, "From the presence cast him forth!"But the knight never ceased his steady gazeUpon the Pope.  At last,--"I have not spokenTo be condemned," he said, "by such as these.Thou, spiritual Father, answer me.Look thou upon me with the eyes of Christ.Can I through expiation gain my shrift,And work mine own redemption?"  "Insolent man!"Thundered the outraged Pope, "is this the toneWherewith thou dost parade thy loathsome sin?Down on thy knees, and wallow on the earth!Nay, rather go! there is no ray of hope,No gleam, through cycles of eternity,For the redemption of a soul like thine.Yea, sooner shall my pastoral rod branch forthIn leaf and blossom, and green shoots of spring,Than Christ will pardon thee."  And as he spoke,He struck the rod upon the floor with forceThat gave it entrance 'twixt two loosened tiles,So that it stood, fast-rooted and alone.The knight saw naught, he only heard his judgeRing forth his curses, and the court cry out"Anathema!" and loud, and blent therewith,Derisive laughter in the very hall,And a wild voice that thrilled through flesh and heart:"ONCE BEING MINE, THOU ART FOREVER MINE!"Half-mad he clasped both hands upon his brow,Amidst the storm of voices, till they died,And all was silence, save the reckless songOf a young bird upon a twig without.Then a defiant, ghastly face he raised,And shrieked, "'T is false!  I am no longer thine!"And through the windows open to the park,Rushed forth, beyond the sight and sound of men.  By church nor palace paused he, till he passedAll squares and streets, and crossed the bridge of stone,And stood alone amidst the broad expanseOf the Campagna, twinkling in the heat.He knelt upon a knoll of turf, and snappedThe cord that held the cross about his neck,And far from him the leaden burden flung."O God!  I thank Thee, that my faith in TheeSubsists at last, through all discouragements.Between us must no type nor symbol stand,No mediator, were he more divineThan the incarnate Christ.  All forms, all priests,I part aside, and hold communion freeBeneath the empty sky of noon, with naughtBetween my nothingness and thy high heavens--Spirit with spirit.  O, have mercy, God!Cleanse me from lust and bitterness and pride,Have mercy in accordance with my faith."Long time he lay upon the scorching grass,With his face buried in the tangled weeds.Ah! who can tell the struggles of his soulAgainst its demons in that sacred hour,The solitude, the anguish, the remorse?When shadows long and thin lay on the ground,Shivering with fever, helpless he arose,But with a face divine, ineffable,Such as we dream the face of Israel,When the Lord's wrestling angel, at gray dawn,Blessed him, and disappeared.                                 Upon the marsh,All night, he wandered, striving to emergeFrom the wild, pathless plain,--now limitlessAnd colorless beneath the risen moon;Outstretching like a sea, with landmarks none,Save broken aqueducts and parapets,And ruined columns glinting 'neath the moon.His dress was dank and clinging with the dew;A thousand insects fluttered o'er his head,With buzz and drone; unseen cicadas chirpedAmong the long, rank grass, and far and nearThe fire-flies flickered through the summer air.Vague thoughts and gleams prophetic filled his brain."Ah, fool!" he mused, "to look for help from men.Had they the will to aid, they lack the power.In mine own flesh and soul the sin had birth,Through mine own anguish it must be atoned.Our saviours are not saints and ministers,But tear-strung women, children soft of heart,Or fellow-sufferers, who, by some chance word,Some glance of comfort, save us from despair.These I have found, thank heaven! to strengthen trustIn mine own kind, when all the world grew dark.Make me not proud in spirit, O my God!Yea, in thy sight I am one mass of sin,One black and foul corruption, yet I knowMy frailty is exceeded by thy love.Neither is this the slender straw of hope,Whereto I, drowning, cling, but firm belief,That fills my inmost soul with vast content.As surely as the hollow faiths of oldShriveled to dust before one ray of Truth,So will these modern temples pass away,Piled upon rotten doctrines, baseless forms,And man will look in his own breast for help,Yea, search for comfort his own inward reins,Revere himself, and find the God within.Patience and patience!"  Through the sleepless nightHe held such thoughts; at times before his eyesFlashed glimpses of the Church that was to be,Sublimely simple in the light sereneOf future ages; then the vision changedTo the Pope's hall, thronged with high priests, who hurledTheir curses on him.  Staggering, he awokeUnto the truth, and found himself alone,Beneath the awful stars.  When dawn's first chillCrept though the shivering grass and heavy leaves,Giddy and overcome, he fell and sleptUpon the dripping weeds, nor dreamed nor stirred,Until the wide plain basked in noon's broad light.He dragged his weary frame some paces more,Unto a solitary herdsman's hut,Which, in the vagueness of the moonlit night,Was touched with lines of beauty, till it grewFair as the ruined works of ancient art,Now squat and hideous with its wattled roof,Decaying timbers, and loose door wide oped,Half-fallen from the hinge.  A drowsy man,Bearded and burnt, in shepherd habit lay,Stretched on the floor, slow-munching, half asleep,His frugal fare; for thus, at blaze of noon,The shepherds sought a shelter from the sun,Leaving their vigilant dogs beside their flock.The knight craved drink and bread, and with respectFor pilgrim weeds, the Roman herdsman stirredHis lazy length, and shared with him his meal.Refreshed and calm, Sir Tannhauser passed forth,Yearning with morbid fancy once againTo see the kind face of the minstrel boyHe met beside the well.  At set of sunHe reached the place; the reaping-folk were gone,The day's toil over, yet he took his seat.A milking-girl with laden buckets full,Came slowly from the pasture, paused and drank.From a near cottage ran a ragged boy,And filled his wooden pail, and to his homeReturned across the fields.  A herdsman came,And drank and gave his dog to drink, and passed,Greeting the holy man who sat there still,Awaiting.  But his feeble pulse beat highWhen he descried at last a youthful form,Crossing the field, a pitcher on his head,Advancing towards the well.  Yea, this was he,The same grave eyes, and open, girlish face.But he saw not, amidst the landscape brown,The knight's brown figure, who, to win his ear,Asked the lad's name.  "My name is Salvator,To serve you, sir," he carelessly replied,With eyes and hands intent upon his jar,Brimming and bubbling.  Then he cast one glanceUpon his questioner, and left the well,Crying with keen and sudden sympathy,"Good Father, pardon me, I knew you not.Ah! you have travelled overmuch: your feetAre grimed with mud and wet, your face is changed,Your hands are dry with fever."  But the knight:"Nay, as I look on thee, I think the LordWills not that I should suffer any more.""Then you have suffered much," sighed Salvator,With wondering pity.  "You must come with me;My father knows of you, I told him all.A knight and minstrel who cast by his lyre,His health and fame, to give himself to God,--Yours is a life indeed to be desired!If you will lie with us this night, our homeWill verily be blessed."  By kindness crushed,Wandering in sense and words, the broken knightResisted naught, and let himself be ledTo the boy's home.  The outcast and accursedWas welcomed now by kindly human hands;Once more his blighted spirit was revivedBy contact with refreshing innocence.There, when the morning broke upon the world,The humble hosts no longer knew their guest.His fleshly weeds of sin forever doffed,Tannhauser lay and smiled, for in the nightThe angel came who brings eternal peace.           ____________________Far into Wartburg, through all Italy,In every town the Pope sent messengers,Riding in furious haste; among them, oneWho bore a branch of dry wood burst in bloom;The pastoral rod had borne green shoots of spring,And leaf and blossom.

The wondrous golden sunIs linked unto the glow-worm's tiny spark;The eagle soars to heaven in his flight;And in those realms of space, all bathed in light,Soar none except the eagle and the lark.            MATINS.Gray earth, gray mist, gray sky:Through vapors hurrying by,Larger than wont, on high  Floats the horned, yellow moon.Chill airs are faintly stirred,And far away is heard,Of some fresh-awakened bird,  The querulous, shrill tune.The dark mist hides the faceOf the dim land: no traceOf rock or river's place  In the thick air is drawn;But dripping grass smells sweet,And rustling branches meet,And sounding water greet  The slow, sure, sacred dawn.Past is the long black night,With its keen lightnings white,Thunder and floods: new light  The glimmering low east streaks.The dense clouds part: betweenTheir jagged rents are seenPale reaches blue and green,  As the mirk curtain breaks.Above the shadowy world,Still more and more unfurled,The gathered mists upcurled  Like phantoms melt and pass.In clear-obscure revealed,Brown wood, gray stream, dark field:Fresh, healthy odors yield  Wet furrows, flowers, and grass.The sudden, splendid gleamOf one thin, golden beamShoots from the feathered rim  Of yon hill crowned with woods.Down its embowered side,As living waters slide,So the great morning tide  Follows in sunny floods.From bush and hedge and treeJoy, unrestrained and free,Breaks forth in melody,  Twitter and chirp and song:Alive the festal airWith gauze-winged creatures fair,That flicker everywhere,  Dart, poise, and flash along.The shining mists are gone,Slight films of gold swift-blownBefore the strong, bright sun  Or the deep-colored sky:A world of life and glowSparkles and basks below,Where the soft meads a-row,  Hoary with dew-fall, lie.Does not the morn break thus,Swift, bright, victorious,With new skies cleared for us,  Over the soul storm-tost?Her night was long and deep,Strange visions vexed her sleep,Strange sorrows bade her weep:  Her faith in dawn was lost.No halt, no rest for her,The immortal wandererFrom sphere to higher sphere,  Toward the pure source of day.The new light shames her fears,Her faithlessness, her tears,As the new sun appears  To light her godlike way.               SAINT ROMUALDO.I give God thanks that I, a lean old man,Wrinkled, infirm, and crippled with keen painsBy austere penance and continuous toil,Now rest in spirit, and possess "the peaceWhich passeth understanding." Th' end draws nigh,Though the beginning is yesterday,And a broad lifetime spreads 'twixt this and that--A favored life, though outwardly the buttOf ignominy, malice, and affront,Yet lighted from within by the clear starOf a high aim, and graciously prolongedTo see at last its utmost goal attained.I speak not of mine Order and my House,Here founded by my hands and filled with saints--A white society of snowy souls,Swayed by my voice, by mine example led;For this is but the natural harvest reapedFrom labors such as mine when blessed by God.Though I rejoice to think my spirit stillWill work my purposes, through worthy hands,After my bones are shriveled into dust,Yet have I gleaned a finer, sweeter fruitOf holy satisfaction, sure and real,Though subtler than the tissue of the air--The power completely to detach the soulFrom her companion through this life, the flesh;So that in blessed privacy of peace,Communing with high angels, she can hold,Serenely rapt, her solitary course.  Ye know, O saints of heaven, what I have borneOf discipline and scourge; the twisted lashOf knotted rope that striped my shrinking limbs;Vigils and fasts protracted, till my fleshWasted and crumbled from mine aching bones,And the last skin, one woof of pain and sores,Thereto like yellow parchment loosely clung;Exposure to the fever and the frost,When 'mongst the hollows of the hills I lurkedFrom persecution of misguided folk,Accustoming my spirit to ignoreThe burden of the cross, while picturingThe bliss of disembodied souls, the graceOf holiness, the lives of sainted men,And entertaining all exalted thoughts,That nowise touched the trouble of the hour,Until the grief and pain seemed far less realThan the creations of my brain inspired.The vision, the beatitude, were true:The agony was but an evil dream.I speak not now as one who hath not learnedThe purport of those lightly-bandied words,Evil and Fate, but rather one who knowsThe thunders of the terrors of the world.No mortal chance or change, no earthly shock,Can move or reach my soul, securely thronedOn heights of contemplation and calm prayer,Happy, serene, no less actual joyOf present peace than faith in joys to come.  This soft, sweet, yellow evening, how the treesStand crisp against the clear, bright-colored sky!How the white mountain-tops distinctly shine,Taking and giving radiance, and the slopesAre purpled with rich floods of peach-hued light!Thank God, my filmy, old dislustred eyesFind the same sense of exquisite delight,My heart vibrates to the same touch of joyIn scenes like this, as when my pulse danced high,And youth coursed through my veins!  This the one linkThat binds the wan old man that now I amTo the wild lad who followed up the houndsAmong Ravenna's pine-woods by the sea.For there how oft would I lose all delightIn the pursuit, the triumph, or the game,To stray alone among the shadowy glades,And gaze, as one who is not satisfiedWith gazing, at the large, bright, breathing sea,The forest glooms, and shifting gleams betweenThe fine dark fringes of the fadeless trees,On gold-green turf, sweet-brier, and wild pink rose!How rich that buoyant air with changing scentOf pungent pine, fresh flowers, and salt cool seas!And when all echoes of the chase had died,Of horn and halloo, bells and baying hounds,How mine ears drank the ripple of the tideOn the fair shore, the chirp of unseen birds,The rustling of the tangled undergrowth,And the deep lyric murmur of the pines,When through their high tops swept the sudden breeze!There was my world, there would my heart dilate,And my aspiring soul dissolve in prayerUnto that Spirit of Love whose energiesWere active round me, yet whose presence, spheredIn the unsearchable, unbodied air,Made itself felt, but reigned invisible.This ere the day that made me what I am.Still can I see the hot, bright sky, the seaIllimitably sparkling, as they showedThat morning.  Though I deemed I took no noteOf heaven or earth or waters, yet my mindRetains to-day the vivid portraitureOf every line and feature of the scene.Light-hearted 'midst the dewy lanes I faredUnto the sea, whose jocund gleam I caughtBetween the slim boles, when I heard the clinkOf naked weapons, then a sudden thrustSickening to hear, and then a stifled groan;And pressing forward I beheld the sightThat seared itself for ever on my brain--My kinsman, Ser Ranieri, on the turf,Fallen upon his side, his bright young headAmong the pine-spurs, and his cheek pressed closeUnto the moist, chill sod: his fingers clutchedA handful of loose weeds and grass and earth,Uprooted in his anguish as he fell,And slowly from his heart the thick stream flowed,Fouling the green, leaving the fair, sweet faceGhastly, transparent, with blue, stony eyesStaring in blankness on that other oneWho triumphed over him.  With hot desireOf instant vengeance I unsheathed my swordTo rush upon the slayer, when he turnedIn his first terror of blood-guiltiness.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .Within my heart a something snapped and brake.What was it but the chord of rapturous joyFor ever stilled?  I tottered and would fall,Had I not leaned against the friendly pine;For all realities of life, unmooredFrom their firm anchorage, appeared to floatLike hollow phantoms past my dizzy brain.The strange delusion wrought upon my soulThat this had been enacted ages since.This very horror curdled at my heart,This net of trees spread round, these iron heavens,Were closing over me when I had stood,Unnumbered cycles back, and fronted HIM,My father; and he felt mine eyes as now,Yet saw me not; and then, as now, that form,The one thing real, lay stretched between us both.The fancy passed, and I stood sane and strongTo grasp the truth.  Then I remembered all--A few fierce words between them yester eveConcerning some poor plot of pasturage,Soon silenced into courteous, frigid calm:This was the end.  I could not meet him now,To curse him, to accuse him, or to save,And draw him from the red entanglementCoiled by his own hands round his ruined life.God pardon me!  My heart that moment heldNo drop of pity toward this wretched soul;And cowering down, as though his guilt were mine,I fled amidst the savage silencesOf that grim wood, resolved to nurse aloneMy boundless desolation, shame, and grief.  There, in that thick-leaved twilight of high noon,The quiet of the still, suspended air,Once more my wandering thoughts were calmly ranged,Shepherded by my will.  I wept, I prayedA solemn prayer, conceived in agony,Blessed with response instant, miraculous;For in that hour my spirit was at oneWith Him who knows and satisfies her needs.The supplication and the blessing sprangFrom the same source, inspired divinely both.I prayed for light, self-knowledge, guidance, truth,And these like heavenly manna were rained downTo feed my hungered soul.  His guilt was mine.What angel had been sent to stay mine armUntil the fateful moment passed awayThat would have ushered an eternityOf withering remorse?  I found the germsIn mine own heart of every human sin,That waited but occasion's tempting breathTo overgrow with poisoned bloom my life.What God thus far had saved me from myself?Here was the lofty truth revealed, that eachMust feel himself in all, must know where'erThe great soul acts or suffers or enjoys,His proper soul in kinship there is bound.Then my life-purpose dawned upon my mind,Encouraging as morning.  As I lay,Crushed by the weight of universal love,Which mine own thoughts had heaped upon myself,I heard the clear chime of a slow, sweet bell.I knew it--whence it came and what it sang.From the gray convent nigh the wood it pealed,And called the monks to prayer.  Vigil and prayer,Clean lives, white days of strict austerity:Such were the offerings of these holy saints.How far might such not tend to expiateA riotous world's indulgence?  Here my life,Doubly austere and doubly sanctified,Might even for that other one atone,So bound to mine, till both should be forgiven.  They sheltered me, not questioning the needThat led me to their cloistered solitude.How rich, how freighted with pure influence,With dear security of perfect peace,Was the first day I passed within those walls!The holy habit of perpetual prayer,The gentle greetings, the rare temperate speech,The chastening discipline, the atmosphereOf settled and profound tranquillity,Were even as living waters unto oneWho perisheth of thirst.  Was this the worldThat yesterday seemed one huge battlefieldFor brutish passions?  Could the soul of manWithdraw so easily, and erect apartHer own fair temple for her own high ends?But this serene contentment slowly wanedAs I discerned the broad disparityBetwixt the form and spirit of the lawsThat bound the order in strait brotherhood.Yet when I sought to gain a larger love,More rigid discipline, severer truth,And more complete surrender of the soulUnto her God, this was to my reproach,And scoffs and gibes beset me on all sides.In mine own cell I mortified my flesh,I held aloof from all my brethren's feastsTo wrestle with my viewless enemies,Till they should leave their blessing on my head;For nightly was I haunted by that face,White, bloodless, as I saw it 'midst the ferns,Now staring out of darkness, and it heldMine eyes from slumber and my brain from restAnd drove me from my straw to weep and pray.Rebellious thoughts such subtle torture wroughtUpon my spirit that I lay day-longIn dumb despair, until the blessed hopeOf mercy dawned again upon my soul,As gradual as the slow gold moon that mountsThe airy steps of heaven.  My faith aroseWith sure perception that disaster, wrong,And every shadow of man's destinyAre merely circumstance, and cannot touchThe soul's fine essence: they exist or dieOnly as she affirms them or denies.  This faith sustain me even to the end:It floods my heart with peace as surely nowAs on that day the friars drove me forth,Urging that my asceticism, too harsh,Endured through pride, would bring into reproachTheir customs and their order.  Then beganMy exile in the mountains, where I bodeA hunted man.  The elements conspiredAgainst me, and I was the seasons' sport,Drenched, parched, and scorched and frozen alternately,Burned with shrewd frosts, prostrated by fierce heats,Shivering 'neath chilling dews and gusty rains,And buffeted by all the winds of heaven.Yet was this period my time of joy:My daily thoughts perpetual converse heldWith angels ministrant; mine ears were charmedWith sweet accordance of celestial sounds,Song, harp and choir, clear ringing through the air.And visions were revealed unto mine eyesBy night and day of Heaven's very courts,In shadowless, undimmed magnificence.I gave God thanks, not that He sheltered me,And fed me as He feeds the fowls of air--For had I perished, this too had been well--But for the revelation of His truth,The glory, the beatitude vouchsafedTo exalt, to heal, to quicken, to inspire;So that the pinched, lean excommunicateWas crowned with joy more solid, more secure,Than all the comfort of the vales could bring.Then the good Lord touched certain fervid hearts,Aspiring toward His love, to come to me,Timid and few at first; but as they heardFrom mine own lips the precious oracles,That soothed the trouble of their souls, appeasedTheir spiritual hunger, and disclosedAll of the God within them to themselves,They flocked about me, and they hailed me saint,And sware to follow and to serve the goodWhich my word published and my life declared.Thus the lone hermit of the mountain-topDescended leader of a band of saints,And midway 'twixt the summit and the valeI perched my convent.  Yet I bated notOne whit of strict restraint and abstinence.And they who love me and who serve the truthHave learned to suffer with me, and have wonThe supreme joy that is not of the flesh,Foretasting the delights of Paradise.This faith, to them imparted, will endureAfter my tongue hath ceased to utter it,And the great peace hath settled on my soul.               AFTERNOON.    Small, shapeless drifts of cloudSail slowly northward in the soft-hued sky,  With blur half-tints and rolling summits bright,By the late sun caressed; slight hazes shroud  All things afar; shineth each leaf anigh    With its own warmth and light.    O'erblown by Southland airs,The summer landscape basks in utter peace:  In lazy streams the lazy clouds are seen;Low hills, broad meadows, and large, clear-cut squares  Of ripening corn-fields, rippled by the breeze,    With shifting shade and sheen.    Hark! and you may not hearA sound less soothing than the rustle cool  Of swaying leaves, the steady wiry droneOf unseen crickets, sudden chirpings clear  Of happy birds, the tinkle of the pool,    Chafed by a single stone.    What vague, delicious dreams,Born of this golden hour of afternoon,  And air balm-freighted, fill the soul with bliss,Transpierced like yonder clouds with lustrous gleams,  Fantastic, brief as they, and, like them, spun    Of gilded nothingness!    All things are well with her.'T is good to be alive, to see the light  That plays upon the grass, to feel (and sighWith perfect pleasure) the mild breezes stir  Among the garden roses, red and white,    With whiffs of fragrancy.    There is no troublous thought,No painful memory, no grave regret,  To mar the sweet suggestions of the hour:The soul, at peace, reflects the peace without,  Forgetting grief as sunset skies forget    The morning's transient shower.               PHANTASIES.          (After Robert Schumann).                I. Evening.Rest, beauty, stillness: not a waif of a cloudFrom gray-blue east sheer to the yellow west--No film of mist the utmost slopes to shroud.The earth lies grace, by quiet airs caressed,And shepherdeth her shadows, but each stream,Free to the sky, is by that glow possessed,And traileth with the splendors of a dreamAthwart the dusky land.  Uplift thine eyes!Unbroken by a vapor or a gleam,The vast clear reach of mild, wan twilight skies.But look again, and lo, the evening star!Against the pale tints black the slim elms rise,The earth exhales sweet odors nigh and far,And from the heavens fine influences fall.Familiar things stand not for what they are:What they suggest, foreshadow, or recallThe spirit is alert to apprehend,Imparting somewhat of herself to all.Labor and thought and care are at an end:The soul is filled with gracious reveries,And with her mood soft sounds and colors blend;For simplest sounds ring forth like melodiesIn this weird-lighted air--the monotoneOf some far bell, the distant farmyard cries,A barking dog, the thin, persistent droneOf crickets, and the lessening call of birds.The apparition of yon star aloneBreaks on the sense like music.  Beyond wordThe peace that floods the soul, for night is here,And Beauty still is guide and harbinger.                II. Aspiration.Dark lies the earth, and bright with worlds the sky:That soft, large, lustrous star, that first outshone,Still holds us spelled with potent sorcery.Dilating, shrinking, lightening, it hath wonOur spirit with its strange strong influence,And sways it as the tides beneath the moon.What impulse this, o'ermastering heart and sense?Exalted, thrilled, the freed soul fain would soarUnto that point of shining prominence,Craving new fields and some unheard-of shore,Yea, all the heavens, for her activity,To mount with daring flight, to hover o'erLow hills of earth, flat meadows, level sea,And earthly joy and trouble.  In this hourOf waning light and sound, of mystery,Of shadowed love and beauty-veiled power,She feels her wings: she yearns to grasp her own,Knowing the utmost good to be her dower.A dream! a dream! for at a touch 't is gone.O mocking spirit! thy mere fools are we,Unto the depths from heights celestial thrown.From these blind gropings toward reality,This thirst for truth, this most pathetic needOf something to uplift, to justify,To help and comfort while we faint and bleed,May we not draw, wrung from the last despair,Some argument of hope, some blessed creed,That we can trust the faith which whispers prayer,The vanishings, the ecstasy, the gleam,The nameless aspiration, and the dream?               III. Wherefore?Deep languor overcometh mind and frame:A listless, drowsy, utter weariness,A trance wherein no thought finds speech or name,The overstrained spirit doth possess.She sinks with drooping wing--poor unfledged bird,That fain had flown!--in fluttering breathlessness.To what end those high hopes that wildly stirredThe beating heart with aspirations vain?Why proffer prayers unanswered and unheardTo blank, deaf heavens that will not heed her pain?Where lead these lofty, soaring tendencies,That leap and fly and poise, to fall again,Yet seem to link her with the utmost skies?What mean these clinging loves that bind to earth,And claim her with beseeching, wistful eyes?This little resting-place 'twixt death and birth,Why is it fretted with the ceaseless flowOf flood and ebb, with overgrowth and dearth,And vext with dreams, and clouded with strange woe?Ah! she is tired of thought, she yearns for peace,Seeing all things one equal end must know.Wherefore this tangle of perplexities,The trouble or the joy? the weary mazeOf narrow fears and hopes that may not cease?A chill falls on her from the skyey ways,Black with the night-tide, where is none to hearThe ancient cry, the Wherefore of our days.               IV. Fancies.The ceaseless whirr of crickets fills the earFrom underneath each hedge and bush and tree,Deep in the dew-drenched grasses everywhere.The simple sound dispels the fantasyOf gloom and terror gathering round the mind.It seems a pleasant thing to breathe, to be,To hear the many-voiced, soft summer windLisp through the dark thick leafage overhead--To see the rosy half-moon soar behindThe black slim-branching elms.  Sad thoughts have fled,Trouble and doubt, and now strange reveriesAnd odd caprices fill us in their stead.From yonder broken disk the redness dies,Like gold fruit through the leaves the half-sphere gleams,Then over the hoar tree-tops climbs the skies,Blanched ever more and more, until it beamsWhiter than crystal.  Like a scroll unfurled,And shadowy as a landscape seen in dreams,Reveals itself the sleeping, quiet world,Painted in tender grays and whites subdued--The speckled stream with flakes of light impearled,The wide, soft meadow and the massive wood.Naught is too wild for our credulityIn this weird hour: our finest dreams hold good.Quaint elves and frolic flower-sprites we see,And fairies weaving rings of gossamer,And angels floating through the filmy air.               V. In the Night.Let us go in: the air is dank and chillWith dewy midnight, and the moon rides highO'er ghostly fields, pale stream, and spectral hill.This hour the dawn seems farthest from the skySo weary long the space that lies betweenThat sacred joy and this dark mysteryOf earth and heaven: no glimmering is seen,In the star-sprinkled east, of coming day,Nor, westward, of the splendor that hath been.Strange fears beset us, nameless terrors swayThe brooding soul, that hungers for her rest,Out worn with changing moods, vain hopes' delay,With conscious thought o'erburdened and oppressed.The mystery and the shadow wax too deep;She longs to merge both sense and thought in sleep.               VI. Faerie.From the oped lattice glance once more abroadWhile the ethereal moontide bathes with lightHill, stream, and garden, and white-winding road.All gracious myths born of the shadowy nightRecur, and hover in fantastic guise,Airy and vague, before the drowsy sight.On yonder soft gray hill Endymion liesIn rosy slumber, and the moonlit airBreathes kisses on his cheeks and lips and eyes.'Twixt bush and bush gleam flower-white limbs, left bare,Of huntress-nymphs, and flying raiment thin,Vanishing faces, and bright floating hair.The quaint midsummer fairies and their kin,Gnomes, elves, and trolls, on blossom, branch, and grassGambol and dance, and winding out and inLeave circles of spun dew where'er they pass.Through the blue ether the freed Ariel flies;Enchantment holds the air; a swarming massOf myriad dusky, gold-winged dreams arise,Throng toward the gates of sense, and so possessThe soul, and lull it to forgetfulness.            VII. Confused Dreams.O strange, dim other-world revealed to us,Beginning there where ends reality,Lying 'twixt life and death, and populousWith souls from either sphere! now enter weThy twisted paths.  Barred is the silver gate,But the wild-carven doors of ivorySpring noiselessly apart: between them straightFlies forth a cloud of nameless shadowy things,With harpies, imps, and monsters, small and great,Blurring the thick air with darkening wings.All humors of the blood and brain take shape,And fright us with our own imaginings.A trouble weighs upon us: no escapeFrom this unnatural region can there be.Fixed eyes stare on us, wide mouths grin and gape,Familiar faces out of reach we see.Fain would we scream, to shatter with a cryThe tangled woof of hideous fantasy,When, lo! the air grows clear, a soft fair skyShines over head: sharp pain dissolves in peace;Beneath the silver archway quietlyWe float away: all troublous visions cease.By a strange sense of joy we are possessed,Body and spirit soothed in perfect rest.            VIII. The End of the Song.What dainty note of long-drawn melodyAthwart our dreamless sleep rings sweet and clear,Till all the fumes of slumber are brushed by,And with awakened consciousness we hearThe pipe of birds?  Look forth!  The sane, white dayBlesses the hilltops, and the sun is near.All misty phantoms slowly roll awayWith the night's vapors toward the western sky.The Real enchants us, the fresh breath of hayBlows toward us; soft the meadow-grasses lie,Bearded with dew; the air is a caress;The sudden sun o'ertops the boundaryOf eastern hills, the morning joyousnessThrills tingling through the frame; life's pulse beats strong;Night's fancies melt like dew.  So ends the song!    ON THE PROPOSAL TO ERECT A MONUMENT          IN ENGLAND TO LORD BYRON.The grass of fifty Aprils hath waved green  Above the spent heart, the Olympian head,The hands crost idly, the shut eyes unseen,  Unseeing, the locked lips whose song hath fled;Yet mystic-lived, like some rich, tropic flower,His fame puts forth fresh blossoms hour by hour;Wide spread the laden branches dropping dew  On the low, laureled brow misunderstood,  That bent not, neither bowed, until subduedBy the last foe who crowned while he o'erthrew.Fair was the Easter Sabbath morn when first  Men heard he had not wakened to its light:The end had come, and time had done its worst,  For the black cloud had fallen of endless night.Then in the town, as Greek accosted Greek,'T was not the wonted festal words to speak,"Christ is arisen," but "Our chief is gone,"  With such wan aspect and grief-smitten head  As when the awful cry of "Pan is dead!"Filled echoing hill and valley with its moan."I am more fit for death than the world deems,"  So spake he as life's light was growing dim,And turned to sleep as unto soothing dreams.  What terrors could its darkness hold for him,Familiar with all anguish, but with fearStill unacquainted?  On his martial bierThey laid a sword, a helmet, and a crown--  Meed of the warrior, but not these among  His voiceless lyre, whose silent chords unstrungShall wait--how long?--for touches like his own.An alien country mourned him as her son,  And hailed him hero: his sole, fitting tombWere Theseus' temple or the Parthenon,  Fondly she deemed.  His brethren bare him home,Their exiled glory, past the guarded gateWhere England's Abbey shelters England's great.Afar he rests whose very name hath shed  New lustre on her with the song he sings.  So Shakespeare rests who scorned to lie with kings,Sleeping at peace midst the unhonored dead.And fifty years suffice to overgrow  With gentle memories the foul weeds of hateThat shamed his grave.  The world begins to know  Her loss, and view with other eyes his fate.Even as the cunning workman brings to passThe sculptor's thought from out the unwieldy massOf shapeless marble, so Time lops away  The stony crust of falsehood that concealed  His just proportions, and, at last revealed,The statue issues to the light of day,Most beautiful, most human.  Let them fling  The first stone who are tempted even as he,And have not swerved.  When did that rare soul sing  The victim's shame, the tyrant's eulogy,The great belittle, or exalt the small,Or grudge his gift, his blood, to disenthrallThe slaves of tyranny or ignorance?  Stung by fierce tongues himself, whose rightful fame  Hath he reviled?  Upon what noble nameDid the winged arrows of the barbed wit glance?The years' thick, clinging curtains backward pull,  And show him as he is, crowned with bright beams,"Beauteous, and yet not all as beautiful  As he hath been or might be; Sorrow seemsHalf of his immortality."*  He needsNo monument whose name and song and deedsAre graven in all foreign hearts; but she  His mother, England, slow and last to wake,  Needs raise the votive shaft for her fame's sake:Hers is the shame if such forgotten be!  May, 1875.  *"Cain," Act I. Scene 1.            ARABESQUE.On a background of pale goldI would trace with quaint design,    Penciled fine,Brilliant-colored, Moorish scenes,Mosques and crescents, pages, queens,    Line on line,That the prose-world of to-dayMight the gorgeous Past's array    Once behold.On the magic painted shieldRich Granada's Vega green    Should be seen;Crystal fountains, coolness flinging,Hanging gardens' skyward springing    Emerald sheen;Ruddy when the daylight falls,Crowned Alhambra's beetling walls    Stand revealed;Balconies that overbrowField and city, vale and stream.    In a dreamLulled the drowsy landscape basks;    Mark the gleamSilvery of each white-swathed peak!Mountain-airs caress the cheek,    Fresh from the snow.Here in Lindaraxa's bowerThe immortal roses bloom;    In the roomLion-guarded, marble-paven,Still the fountain leaps to heaven.    But the doomOf the banned and stricken raceOvershadows every place,    Every hour.Where fair Lindaraxa dweltFlits the bat on velvet wings;    Mute the stringsOf the broken mandoline;The Pavilion of the Queen    Widely flingsVacant windows to the night;Moonbeams kiss the floor with light    Where she knelt.Through these halls that people steppedWho through darkling centuries    Held the keysOf all wisdom, truth, and art,In a Paradise apart,   Lapped in ease,Sagely pondering deathless themes,While, befooled with monkish dreams,    Europe slept.Where shall they be found today?Yonder hill that frets the sky    "The last SighOf the Moor" is named still.There the ill-starred Boabdil    Bade good-byTo Granada and to Spain,Where the Crescent ne'er again    Holdeth sway.Vanished like the wind that blows,Whither shall we seek their trace    On earth's face?The gigantic wheel of fate,Crushing all things soon or late,   Now a race,Now a single life o'erruns,Now a universe of suns,    Now a rose.            AGAMEMNON'S TOMB.Uplift the ponderous, golden mask of death,  And let the sun shine on him as it didHow many thousand years agone!  Beneath  This worm-defying, uncorrupted lid,Behold the young, heroic face, round-eyed,Of one who in his full-flowered manhood died;  Of nobler frame than creatures of to-day,Swathed in fine linen cerecloths fold on fold,With carven weapons wrought of bronze and gold,  Accoutred like a warrior for the fray.We gaze in awe at these huge-modeled limbs,  Shrunk in death's narrow house, but hinting yetTheir ancient majesty; these sightless rims  Whose living eyes the eyes of Helen met;The speechless lips that ah! what tales might tellOf earth's morning-tide when gods did dwell  Amidst a generous-fashioned, god-like race,Who dwarf our puny semblance, and who wonThe secret soul of Beauty for their own,  While all our art but crudely apes their grace.We gather all the precious relics up,  The golden buttons chased with wondrous craft,The sculptured trinkets and the crystal cup,  The sheathed, bronze sword, the knife with brazen haft.Fain would we wrest with curious eyes from theseUnnumbered long-forgotten histories,  The deeds heroic of this mighty man,On whom once more the living daylight beams,To shame our littleness, to mock our dreams,  And the abyss of centuries to span.Yet could we rouse him from his blind repose,  How might we meet his searching questionings,Concerning all the follies, wrongs, and woes,  Since his great day whom men call King of Kings,Victorious Agamemnon?  How might weThose large, clear eyes confront, which scornfully  Would view us as a poor, degenerate race,Base-souled and mean-proportioned?  What replyGive to the beauty-loving Greek's heart-cry,  Seeking his ancient gods in vacant space?What should he find within a world grown cold,  Save doubt and trouble?  To his sunny creed  A thousand gloomy, warring sects succeed.How of the Prince of Peace might he be told,  When over half the world the war-cloud lowers?  How would he mock these faltering hopes of ours,Who knows the secret now of death and fate!  Humbly we gaze on the colossal frame,  And mutely we accept the mortal shame,Of men degraded from a high estate.           SIC SEMPER LIBERATORIBUS!                March 13, 1881.As one who feels the breathless nightmare gripHis heart-strings, and through visioned horrors fares,Now on a thin-ledged chasm's rock-crumbling lip,Now on a tottering pinnacle that dareThe front of heaven, while always unawaresWeird monsters start above, around, beneath,Each glaring from some uglier mask of death,So the White Czar imperial progress madeThrough terror-haunted days.  A shock, a cryWhose echoes ring the globe--the spectre's laid.Hurled o'er the abyss, see the crowned martyr lieResting in peace--fear, change, and death gone by.Fit end for nightmare--mist of blood and tears,Red climax to the slow, abortive years.The world draws breath--one long, deep-shuddering sigh,At that which dullest brain prefigured clearAs swift-sure bolt from thunder-threatening sky.How heaven-anointed humblest lots appearBeside his glittering eminence of fear;His spiked crown, sackcloth purple, poisoned cates,His golden palace honey-combed with hates.Well is it done!  A most heroic plan,Which after myriad plots succeeds at lastIn robbing of his life this poor old man,Whose sole offense--his birthright--has but passedTo fresher blood, with younger strength recast.What men are these, who, clamoring to be free,Would bestialize the world to what they be?Whose sons are they who made the snow-wreathed headTheir frenzy's target?  In their Russian veins,What alien current urged on to smite him dead,Whose word had loosed a million Russian chains?What brutes were they for whom such speechless pains,So royally endured, no human thrillAwoke, in hearts drunk with the lust to kill?Not brutes!  No tiger of the wilderness,No jackal of the jungle, bears such brandAs man's black heart, who shrinks not to confessThe desperate deed of his deliberate hand.Our kind, our kin, have done this thing.  We standBowed earthward, red with shame, to see such wrongProrogue Love's cause and Truth's--God knows how long!               DON RAFAEL.      "I would not have," he said,"Tears, nor the black pall, nor the wormy grave,Grief's hideous panoply I would not have      Round me when I am dead.      "Music and flowers and light,And choric dances to guitar and flute,Be these around me when my lips are mute,      Mine eyes are sealed from sight.      "So let me lie one day,One long, eternal day, in sunshine bathed,In cerements of silken tissue swathed,      Smothered 'neath flowers of May.      "One perfect day of peace,Or ere clean flame consume my fleshly veil,My life--a gilded vapor--shall exhale,      Brief as a sigh--and cease.      "But ere the torch be laidTo my unshrinking limbs by some true hand,Athwart the orange-fragrant laughing land,      Bring many a dark-eyed maid      "From the bright, sea-kissed town;My beautiful, beloved enemies,Gemmed as the dew, voluptuous as the breeze,      Each in her festal gown.      "All those through whom I learnedThe sweet of folly and the pains of love,My Rose, my Star, my Comforter, my Dove,      For whom, poor moth, I burned.      "Loves of a day, and hour,Or passions (vowed eternal) of a year,Though each be strange to each, to me all dear      As to the bee the flower.      "Around me they shall moveIn languid contra dances, and shall shedTheir smiling eyebeams as I were not dead,      But quick to flash back love.      "Something not alien quiteTo tender ruth, perchance their breast shall fill,Seeing him that was so mobile grown so still,      The fiery-veined so white.      "And when the dance is o'er,The pinched guitar, the smitten tambourine,Have ceased their rhythmic beat,--oh, friends of mine,      On my rich bier, then pour      "The garlands that ye wear,The happy rose that on your bosom breathes,The fresh-culled clusters and the dewy wreaths      That crown your fragrant hair.      "Though blind, I still shall see,Though dead, shall feel your presence and shall know,I who was beauty's life-long slave, shall so      Win her in death to me.      "Thanks, sisters, and farewell!Back to your joys.  My brother shall make roomFor my tried sword upon the high-piled bloom,      And fire the pinnacle.      "My soul, pure flame, shall leapTo meet its parent essence once againMy body dust and ashes shall remain,      Tired heart and brain shall sleep.      "Life has one gate alone,Obscure, beset with peril and fierce pain.Large death has many portals to his fane,      Why choose we to make moan?      "Why dwell with worms and clayWhen we may soar through air on wings of flame,Dissolve to small, white dust our perfect frame,      And never know decay?      "A brother's pious handThe pure, fire-winnowed ashes shall inurn,And lay them in the orange grove where burn      Globed suns that scent the land.      "The leaf shall be more green,Even for my dust--more snowy-soft the flower,More juicy-sweet the fruit's live pulp--the bower      Richer that I have been.      "For I would not," he said,"Tears and the black pall and the wormy grave,Grief's hideous panoply I would not have      Round me when I am dead."        OFF ROUGH POINT.We sat at twilight nigh the sea,  The fog hung gray and weird.Through the thick film uncannily  The broken moon appeared.We heard the billows crack and plunge,  We saw nor waves nor ships.Earth sucked the vapors like a sponge,  The salt spray wet our lips.Closer the woof of white mist drew,  Before, behind, beside.How could that phantom moon break through,  Above that shrouded tide?The roaring waters filled the ear,  A white blank foiled the sight.Close-gathering shadows near, more near,  Brought the blind, awful night.O friends who passed unseen, unknown!  O dashing, troubled sea!Still stand we on a rock alone,Walled round by mystery.          MATER AMABILIS.Down the goldenest of streams,        Tide of dreams,The fair cradled man-child drifts;Sways with cadenced motion slow,        To and fro,As the mother-foot poised lightly, falls and lifts.He, the firstling,--he, the light        Of her sight,--He, the breathing pledge of love,'Neath the holy passion lies,        Of her eyes,--Smiles to feel the warm, life-giving ray above.She believes that in his vision,        Skies elysianO'er an angel-people shine.Back to gardens of delight,        Taking flight,His auroral spirit basks in dreams divine.But she smiles through anxious tears;        Unborn yearsPressing forward, she perceives.Shadowy muffled shapes, they come        Deaf and dumb,Bringing what? dry chaff and tares, or full-eared sheaves?What for him shall she invoke?        Shall the oakBind the man's triumphant brow?Shall his daring foot alight        On the height?Shall he dwell amidst the humble and the low?Through what tears and sweat and pain,        Must he gainFruitage from the tree of life?Shall it yield him bitter flavor?        Shall its savorBe as manna midst the turmoil and the strife?In his cradle slept and smiled        Thus the childWho as Prince of Peace was hailed.Thus anigh the mother breast,        Lulled to rest,Child-Napoleon down the lilied river sailed.Crowned or crucified--the same        Glows the flameOf her deathless love divine.Still the blessed mother stands,        In all lands,As she watched beside thy cradle and by mine.Whatso gifts the years bestow,        Still men know,While she breathes, lives one who sees(Stand they pure or sin-defiled)        But the childWhom she crooned to sleep and rocked upon her knee.                   FOG.Light silken curtain, colorless and soft,Dreamlike before me floating! what abides        Behind thy pearly veil's        Opaque, mysterious woof?Where sleek red kine, and dappled, crunch day-longThick, luscious blades and purple clover-heads,        Nigh me I still can mark        Cool fields of beaded grass.No more; for on the rim of the globed worldI seem to stand and stare at nothingness.        But songs of unseen birds        And tranquil roll of wavesBring sweet assurance of continuous lifeBeyond this silvery cloud.  Fantastic dreams,        Of tissue subtler still        Than the wreathed fog, arise,And cheat my brain with airy vanishingsAnd mystic glories of the world beyond.        A whole enchanted town        Thy baffling folds conceal--An Orient town, with slender-steepled mosques,Turret from turret springing, dome from dome,        Fretted with burning stones,        And trellised with red gold.Through spacious streets, where running waters flow,Sun-screened by fruit-trees and the broad-leaved palm,        Past the gay-decked bazaars,        Walk turbaned, dark-eyed men.Hark! you can hear the many murmuring tongues,While loud the merchants vaunt their gorgeous wares.        The sultry air is spiced        With fragrance of rich gums,And through the lattice high in yon dead wall,See where, unveiled, an arch, young, dimpled face,        Flushed like a musky peach,        Peers down upon the mart!From her dark, ringleted and bird-poised headShe hath cast back the milk-white silken veil:        'Midst the blank blackness there        She blossoms like a rose.Beckons she not with those bright, full-orbed eyes,And open arms that like twin moonbeams gleam?        Behold her smile on me        With honeyed, scarlet lips!Divine Scheherazade! I am thine.I come!  I come!--Hark! from some far-off mosque        The shrill muezzin calls        The hour of silent prayer,And from the lattice he hath scared my love.The lattice vanisheth itself--the street,        The mart, the Orient town;        Only through still, soft airThat cry is yet prolonged.  I wake to hearThe distant fog-horn peal: before mine eyes        Stands the white wall of mist,        Blending with vaporous skies.Elusive gossamer, imperviousEven to the mighty sun-god's keen red shafts!        With what a jealous art        Thy secret thou dost guard!Well do I know deep in thine inmost folds,Within an opal hollow, there abides        The lady of the mist,        The Undine of the air--A slender, winged, ethereal, lily form,Dove-eyed, with fair, free-floating, pearl-wreathed hair,        In waving raiment swathed        Of changing, irised hues.Where her feet, rosy as a shell, have grazedThe freshened grass, a richer emerald glows:        Into each flower-cup        Her cool dews she distills.She knows the tops of jagged mountain-peaks,She knows the green soft hollows of their sides,        And unafraid she floats        O'er the vast-circled seas.She loves to bask within the moon's wan beams,Lying, night-long upon the moist, dark earth,        And leave her seeded pearls        With morning on the grass.Ah! that athwart these dim, gray outer courtsOf her fantastic palace I might pass,        And reach the inmost shrine        Of her chaste solitude,And feel her cool and dewy fingers pressMy mortal-fevered brow, while in my heart        She poured with tender love        Her healing Lethe-balm!See! the close curtain moves, the spell dissolves!Slowly it lifts: the dazzling sunshine streams        Upon a newborn world        And laughing summer seas.Swift, snowy-breasted sandbirds twittering glanceThrough crystal air.  On the horizon's marge,        Like a huge purple wraith,        The dusky fog retreats.             THE ELIXIR."Oh brew me a potion strong and good!    One golden drop in his wineShall charm his sense and fire his blood,    And  bend his will to  mine."Poor child of passion! ask of me    Elixir of death or sleep,Or Lethe's stream; but love is free,    And woman must wait and weep.               SONG.              Venus.Frosty lies the winter-landscape,  In the twilight golden-green.Down the Park's deserted alleys,  Naked elms stand stark and lean.Dumb the murmur of the fountain,  Birds have flown from lawn and hill.But while yonder star's ascendant,  Love triumphal reigneth still.See the keen flame throb and tremble,  Brightening in the darkening night,Breathing like a thing of passion,  In the sky's smooth chrysolite.Not beneath the moon, oh lover,  Thou shalt gain thy heart's desire.Speak to-night!  The gods are with thee  Burning with a kindred fire.                 SPRING LONGING.   What art thou doing here, O Imagination?  Go   away I entreat thee by the gods, as thou didst   come, for I want thee not.  But thou art come   according to thy old fashion.  I am not angry   with thee--only go away.                            --Marcus AntoninusLilac hazes veil the skies.    Languid sighsBreathes the mild, caressing air.Pink as coral's branching sprays,    Orchard waysWith the blossomed peach are fair.Sunshine, cordial as a kiss,    Poureth blissIn this craving soul of mine,And my heart her flower-cup    Lifteth up,Thirsting for the draught divine.Swift the liquid golden flame    Through my frameSets my throbbing veins afire.Bright, alluring dreams arise,    Brim mine eyesWith the tears of strong desire.All familiar scenes anear    Disappear--Homestead, orchard, field, and wold.Moorish spires and turrets fair    Cleave the air,Arabesqued on skies of gold.Low, my spirit, this May morn,    Outward borne,Over seas hath taken wing:Where the mediaeval town,    Like a crown,Wears the garland of the Spring.Light and sound and odors sweet    Fill the street;Gypsy girls are selling flowers.Lean hidalgos turn aside,    Amorous-eyed,'Neath the grim cathedral towers.Oh, to be in Spain to-day,    Where the MayRecks no whit of good or evil,Love and only love breathes she!    Oh, to be'Midst the olive-rows of Seville!Or on such a day to glide    With the tideOf the berylline lagoon,Through the streets that mirror heaven,    Crystal paven,In the warm Venetian noon.At the prow the gondolier   May not hear,May not see our furtive kiss;But he lends with cadenced strain    The refrainTo our ripe and silent bliss.Golden shadows, silver light,    Burnish brightAir and water, domes and skies;As in some ambrosial dream,    On the streamFloats our bark in magic wise.Oh, to float day long just so!    Naught to knowOf the trouble, toil, and fret!This is love, and this is May:    YesterdayAnd to-morrow to forget!Whither hast thou, Fancy free,    Guided me,Wild Bohemian sister dear?All thy gypsy soul is stirred    Since yon birdWarbled that the Spring was here.Tempt no more!  I may not follow,    Like the swallow,Gayly on the track of Spring.Bounden by an iron fate,    I must wait,Dream and wonder, yearn and sing.                 THE SOUTH.Night, and beneath star-blazoned summer skies  Behold the Spirit of the musky South,A creole with still-burning, languid eyes,  Voluptuous limbs and incense-breathing mouth:        Swathed in spun gauze is she,From fibres of her own anana tree.Within these sumptuous woods she lies at ease,  By rich night-breezes, dewy cool, caressed:'Twixt cypresses and slim palmetto trees,  Like to the golden oriole's hanging nest,        Her airy hammock swings,And through the dark her mocking-bird yet sings.How beautiful she is!  A tulip-wreath  Twines round her shadowy, free-floating hair:Young, weary, passionate, and sad as death,  Dark visions haunt for her the vacant air,        While movelessly she liesWith lithe, lax, folded hands and heavy eyes.Full well knows she how wide and fair extend  Her groves bright-flowered, her tangled everglades,Majestic streams that indolently wend  Through lush savanna or dense forest shades,        Where the brown buzzard fliesTo broad bayou 'neath hazy-golden skies.Hers is the savage splendor of the swamp,  With pomp of scarlet and of purple bloom,Where blow warm, furtive breezes faint and damp,  Strange insects whir, and stalking bitterns boom--        Where from stale waters deadOft looms the great-jawed alligator's head.Her wealth, her beauty, and the blight on these,--  Of all she is aware: luxuriant woods,Fresh, living, sunlit, in her dream she sees;  And ever midst those verdant solitudes        The soldier's wooden cross,O'ergrown by creeping tendrils and rank moss.Was her a dream of empire? was it sin?  And is it well that all was borne in vain?She knows no more than one who slow doth win,  After fierce fever, conscious life again,        Too tired, too weak, too sad,By the new light to be stirred or glad.From rich sea-islands fringing her green shore,  From broad plantations where swart freemen bendBronzed backs in willing labor, from her store  Of golden fruit, from stream, from town, ascend        Life-currents of pure health:Her aims shall be subserved with boundless wealth.Yet now how listless and how still she lies,  Like some half-savage, dusky Indian queen,Rocked in her hammock 'neath her native skies,  With the pathetic, passive, broken mien        Of one who, sorely proved,Great-souled, hath suffered much and much hath loved!But look! along the wide-branched, dewy glade  Glimmers the dawn: the light palmetto-treesAnd cypresses reissue from the shade,  And SHE hath wakened.  Through clear air she sees        The pledge, the brightening ray,And leaps from dreams to hail the coming day.       SPRING STAR.            I.Over the lamp-lit street,Trodden by hurrying feet,Where mostly pulse and beat    Life's throbbing veins,See where the April star,Blue-bright as sapphires are,Hangs in deep heavens far,    Waxes and wanes.Strangely alive it seems,Darting keen, dazzling gleams,Veiling anon its beams,    Large, clear, and pure.In the broad western skyNo orb may shine anigh,No lesser radiancy    May there endure.Spring airs are blowing sweet:Low in the dusky streetStar-beams and eye-beams meet.    Rapt in his dreams,All through the crowded martPoet with swift-stirred heart,Passing beneath, must start,    Thrilled by those gleams.Naught doth he note anear,Fain through Night's veil to peer,Reach that resplendent sphere,    Reading her sign.Where point those sharp, thin rays,Guiding his weary maze,Blesseth she or betrays,    Who may divine?"Guard me, celestial light,Lofty, serenely bright:Lead my halt feet aright,"    Prayerful he speaks."For a new ray hath shoneOver my spirit lone.Be this new soul the one    whom my soul seeks."                 II.Beside her casement oped the maiden sits,  Where the mild evening spirit of the SpringGently between the city's homesteads flits  To kiss her brows, and floats on languid wing,  Vague longings in her breast awakening.While her heart trembles 'neath those dim, deep skies,As the quick sea that 'neath the globed moon lies.Where her eyes rest the full-orbed evening star  Burns with white flame: it beckons, shrinks, dilates.She, dazzled by that shining world afar,  May not withdraw her gaze: breathless she waits.  Some promised joy from Heaven's very gatesUnto her soul seems proffered.  When shall beThe bright fulfilment of that star's decree?Nor glad nor sad is she: she doth not know  That through the city's throng one threads his way,Thrilled likewise by that planet's mystic glow,  And hastes to seek her.  What sweet change shall sway  Her spirit at his coming?  What new rayUpon his shadowy life from her shall fall?The silent star burns on, and knoweth all.          A JUNE NIGHT.Ten o'clock: the broken moon  Hangs not yet a half hour high,    Yellow as a shield of brass,In the dewy air of June,  Poised between the vaulted sky    And the ocean's liquid glass.Earth lies in the shadow still;  Low black bushes, trees, and lawn    Night's ambrosial dews absorb;Through the foliage creeps a thrill,  Whispering of yon spectral dawn    And the hidden climbing orb.Higher, higher, gathering light,  Veiling with a golden gauze    All the trembling atmosphere,See, the rayless disk grows white!  Hark, the glittering billows pause!    Faint, far sounds possess the ear.Elves on such a night as this  Spin their rings upon the grass;    On the beach the water-fayGreets her lover with a kiss;  Through the air swift spirits pass,    Laugh, caress, and float away.Shut thy lids and thou shalt see  Angel faces wreathed with light,    Mystic forms long vanished hence.Ah, too fine, too rare, they be  For the grosser mortal sight,    And they foil our waking sense.Yet we feel them floating near,  Know that we are not alone,    Though our open eyes beholdNothing save the moon's bright sphere,  In the vacant heavens shown,    And the ocean's path of gold.          MAGNETISM.By the impulse of my will,  By the red flame in my blood,By me nerves' electric thrill,  By the passion of my mood,My concentrated desire,  My undying, desperate love,I ignore Fate, I defy her,  Iron-hearted Death I move.When the town lies numb with sleep,  Here, round-eyed I sit; my breathQuickly stirred, my flesh a-creep,  And I force the gates of death.I nor move nor speak--you'd deem  From my quiet face and hands,I were tranced--but in her dream,  SHE responds, she understands.I have power on what is not,  Or on what has ceased to be,From that deep, earth-hollowed spot,  I can lift her up to me.And, or ere I am aware  Through the closed and curtained door,Comes my lady white and fair,  And embraces me once more.Though the clay clings to her gown,  Yet all heaven is in her eyes;Cool, kind fingers press mine eyes,  To my soul her soul replies.But when breaks the common dawn,  And the city wakes--behold!My shy phantom is withdrawn,  And I shiver lone and cold.And I know when she has left,  She is stronger far than I,And more subtly spun her weft,  Than my human wizardry.Though I force her to my will,  By the red flame in my blood,By my nerves' electric thrill,  By the passion of my mood,Yet all day a ghost am I.  Nerves unstrung, spent will, dull brain.I achieve, attain, but die,  And she claims me hers again.          AUGUST MOON.Look! the round-cheeked moon floats high,In the glowing August sky,Quenching all her neighbor stars,Save the steady flame of Mars.White as silver shines the sea,Far-off sails like phantoms be,Gliding o'er that lake of light,Vanishing in nether night.Heavy hangs the tasseled corn,Sighing for the cordial morn;But the marshy-meadows bare,Love this spectral-lighted air,Drink the dews and lift their song,Chirp of crickets all night long;Earth and sea enchanted lie'Neath that moon-usurped sky.To the faces of our friendsUnfamiliar traits she lends--Quaint, white witch, who looketh downWith a glamour all her own.Hushed are laughter, jest, and speech,Mute and heedless each of each,In the glory wan we sit,Visions vague before us flit;Side by side, yet worlds apart,Heart becometh strange to heart.Slowly in a moved voice, then,Ralph, the artist spake again--"Does not that weird orb unrollScenes phantasmal to your soul?As I gaze  thereon, I swear,Peopled grows the vacant air,Fables, myths alone are real,White-clad sylph-like figures steal'Twixt the bushes, o'er the lawn,Goddess, nymph, undine, and faun.Yonder, see the Willis dance,Faces pale with stony glance;They are maids who died unwed,And they quit their gloomy bed,Hungry still for human pleasure,Here to trip a moonlit measure.Near the shore the mermaids play,Floating on the cool, white spray,Leaping from the glittering surfTo the dark and fragrant turf,Where the frolic trolls, and elvesDaintily disport themselves.All the shapes by poet's brain,Fashioned, live for me again,In this spiritual light,Less than day, yet more than night.What a world! a waking dream,All things other than they seem,Borrowing a finer grace,From yon golden globe in space;Touched with wild, romantic glory,Foliage fresh and billows hoary,Hollows bathed in yellow haze,Hills distinct and fields of maize,Ancient legends come to mind.Who would marvel should he find,In the copse or nigh the spring,Summer fairies gambolingWhere the honey-bees do suck,Mab and Ariel and Puck?Ah! no modern mortal seesCreatures delicate as these.All the simple faith has goneWhich their world was builded on.Now the moonbeams coldly glanceOn no gardens of romance;To prosaic senses dull,Baldur's dead, the Beautiful,Hark, the cry rings overhead,'Universal Pan is dead!'""Requiescant!"  Claude's grave toneThrilled us strangely.  "I am oneWho would not restore that Past,Beauty will immortal last,Though the beautiful must die--This the ages verify.And had Pan deserved the nameWhich his votaries misclaim,He were living with us yet.I behold, without regret,Beauty in new forms recast,Truth emerging from the vast,Bright and orbed, like yonder sphere,Making the obscure air clear.He shall be of bards the king,Who, in worthy verse, shall singAll the conquests of the hour,Stealing no fictitious powerFrom the classic types outworn,But his rhythmic line adornWith the marvels of the real.He the baseless feud shall healThat estrangeth wide apartScience from her sister Art.Hold! look through this glass for me?Artist, tell me what you see?""I!" cried Ralph.  "I see in placeOf Astarte's silver face,Or veiled Isis' radiant robe,Nothing but a rugged globeSeamed with awful rents and scars.And below no longer Mars,Fierce, flame-crested god of war,But a lurid, flickering star,Fashioned like our mother earth,Vexed, belike, with death and birth."Rapt in dreamy thought the while,With a sphinx-like shadowy smile,Poet Florio sat, but nowSpake in deep-voiced accents slow,More as one who probes his mind,Than for us--"Who seeks, shall find--Widening knowledge surely bringsVaster themes to him who sings.Was veiled Isis more sublimeThan yon frozen fruit of Time,Hanging in the naked sky?Death's domain--for worlds too die.Lo! the heavens like a scrollStand revealed before my soul;And the hieroglyphs are suns--Changeless change the law that runsThrough the flame-inscribed page,World on world and age on age,Balls of ice and orbs of fire,What abides when these expire?Through slow cycles they revolve,Yet at last like clouds dissolve.Jove, Osiris, Brahma pass,Races wither like the grass.Must not mortals be as godsTo embrace such periods?Yet at Nature's heart remainsOne who waxes not nor wanes.And our crowning glory stillIs to have conceived his will."              SUNRISE.          September 26, 1881.Weep for the martyr!  Strew his bierWith the last roses of the year;Shadow the land with sables; knellThe harsh-tongued, melancholy bell;Beat the dull muffled drum, and flauntThe drooping banner; let the chantOf the deep-throated organ sob--One voice, one sorrow, one heart-throb,From land to land, from sea to sea--The huge world quires his elegy.Tears, love, and honor he shall have,Through ages keeping green his grave.Too late approved, too early lost,His story is the people's boast.Tough-sinewed offspring of the soil,Of peasant lineage, reared to toil,In Europe he had been a thingTo the glebe tethered--here a king!Crowned not for some transcendent gift,Genius of power that may liftA Caesar or a BonaparteUp to the starred goal of his heart;But that he was the epitomeOf all the people aim to be.Were they his dying trust?  He wasNo less their model and their glass.In him the daily traits were viewedOf the undistinguished multitude.Brave as the silent myriads are,Crushed by the juggernaut world-car;Strong with the people's strength, yet mild,Simple and tender as a child;Wise with the wisdom of the heart,Able in council, field, and mart;Nor lacking in the lambent gleam,The great soul's final stamp--the beamOf genial fun, the humor saneWherewith the hero sports with pain.His virtues hold within the spanOf his obscurest fellow-man.To live without reproach, to dieWithout a fear--in these words lieHis highest aims, for none too high.No triumph his beyond the reachOf patient courage, kindly speech;And yet so brave the soul outbreathed,The great example he bequeathed,Were all to follow, we should seeA universal chivalry.His trust, the People!  They respondFrom Maine to Florida, beyondThe sea-walled continent's broad scope,Honor his pledge, confirm his hope.Hark! over seas the echo hence,The nations do him reverence.An Empress lays her votive wreathWhere peoples weep with bated breath.The world-clock strikes a fateful hour,Bright with fair portents, big with power,--The first since history's course has run,When kings' and peoples' cause is one;Those mourn a brother--these a son!O how he loved them!  That gray morn,When his wound-wasted form was borneNorth, from the White House to the sea,Lifting his tired lids thankfully,"How good," he murmured in his pain,"To see the people once again!"Oh, how they loved him!  They stood there,Thronging the road, the street, the square,With hushed lips locked in silent prayer,Uncovered heads and streaming eyes,Breathless as when a father dies.The records of the ghostly ride,Past town and field at morning-tide.When life's full stream is wont to gushThrough all its ways with boisterous rush,--The records note that once a houndHad barked, and once was heard the soundOf cart-wheels rumbling on the stones--And once, mid stifled sobs and groans,One man dared audibly lament,And cried, "God bless the president!"Always the waiting crowds to sendA God-speed to his journey's end--The anxious whisper, brow of gloom,As in a sickness-sacred room,Till his ear drank with ecstasyThe rhythmic thunders of the sea.Tears for the smitten fatherless,The wife's, the mother's life-distress,To whom the million-throated moanFrom throne and hut, may not atoneFor one hushed voice, one empty chair,One presence missing everywhere.But only words of joy and sheer,The people from his grave shall hear.Were they not worthy of his trust,From whose seed sprang the sacred dust?He broke the bars that separateThe humble from the high estate.And heirs of empire round his bedMourn with the "disinherited."Oh, toil-worn, patient Heart that bleeds,Whose martyrdom even his exceeds,Wronged, cursed, despised, misunderstood--Oh, all-enduring multitude,Rejoice! amid you tears, rejoice!There issues from this grave a voice,Proclaiming your long night is o'er,Your day-dawn breaks from shore to shore.You have redeemed his pledge, remainedSecure, erect, and self-sustained,Holding more dear one thing alone,Even than the blood of dearest son,Revering with religious aweThe inviolable might of Law.             A MASQUE OF VENICE.                 (A Dream.)           Not a stain,In the sun-brimmed sapphire cup that is the sky--Not a ripple on the black translucent laneOf the palace-walled lagoon.           Not a cryAs the gondoliers with velvet oar glide by,Through the golden afternoon.           From this heightWhere the carved, age-yellowed balcony o'erjutsYonder liquid, marble pavement, see the lightShimmer soft beneath the bridge,           That abutsOn a labyrinth of water-ways and shutsHalf their sky off with its ridge.           We shall markAll the pageant from this ivory porch of ours,Masques and jesters, mimes and minstrels, while we harkTo their music as they fare.           Scent their flowersFlung from boat to boat in rainbow radiant showersThrough the laughter-ringing air.           See! they come,Like a flock of serpent-throated black-plumed swans,With the mandoline, viol, and the drum,Gems afire on arms ungloved,           Fluttering fans,Floating mantles like a great moth's streaky vansSuch as Veronese loved.           But beholdIn their midst a white unruffled swan appear.One strange barge that snowy tapestries enfold,White its tasseled, silver prow.           Who is here?Prince of Love in masquerade or Prince of Fear,Clad in glittering silken snow?           Cheek and chinWhere the mask's edge stops are of the hoar-frosts hue,And no eyebeams seem to sparkle from withinWhere the hollow rings have place.           Yon gay crewSeem to fly him, he seems ever to pursue.'T is our sport to watch the race.           At his sideStands the goldenest of beauties; from her glance,From her forehead, shines the splendor of a bride,And her feet seem shod with wings,           To entrance,For she leaps into a wild and rhythmic dance,Like Salome at the King's.           'T is his aimJust to hold, to clasp her once against his breast,Hers to flee him, to elude him in the game.Ah, she fears him overmuch!           Is it jest,--Is it earnest? a strange riddle lurks half-guessedIn her horror of his touch.           For each timeThat his snow-white fingers reach her, fades some rayFrom the glory of her beauty in its prime;And the knowledge grows upon us that the dance          Is no play'Twixt the pale, mysterious lover and the fay--But the whirl of fate and chance.           Where the tideOf the broad lagoon sinks plumb into the sea,There the mystic gondolier hath won his bride.Hark, one helpless, stifled scream!           Must it be?Mimes and minstrels, flowers and music, where are ye?Was all Venice such a dream?          AUTUMN SADNESS.Air and sky are swathed in gold    Fold on fold,Light glows through the trees like wine.Earth, sun-quickened, swoons for bliss    'Neath his kiss,Breathless in a trance divine.Nature pauses from her task,    Just to baskIn these lull'd transfigured hours.The green leaf nor stays nor goes,    But it growsRoyaler than mid-June's flowers.Such impassioned silence fills    All the hillsBurning with unflickering fire--Such a blood-red splendor stains    The leaves' veins,Life seems one fulfilled desire.While earth, sea, and heavens shine,    Heart of mine,Say, what art thou waiting for?Shall the cup ne'er reach the lip,    But still slipTill the life-long thirst give o'er?Shall my soul, no frosts may tame,    Catch new flameFrom the incandescent air?In this nuptial joy apart,    Oh my heart,Whither shall we lonely fare?Seek some dusky, twilight spot,    Quite forgotOf the Autumn's Bacchic fire.Where soft mists and shadows sleep,    There outweepBarren longing's vain desire.                  SONNETS.                  ECHOES.Late-born and woman-souled I dare not hope,The freshness of the elder lays, the mightOf manly, modern passion shall alightUpon my Muse's lips, nor may I cope(Who veiled and screened by womanhood must grope)With the world's strong-armed warriors and reciteThe dangers, wounds, and triumphs of the fight;Twanging the full-stringed lyre through all its scope.But if thou ever in some lake-floored caveO'erbrowed by hard rocks, a wild voice wooed and heard,Answering at once from heaven and earth and wave,Lending elf-music to thy harshest word,Misprize thou not these echoes that belongTo one in love with solitude and song.                 SUCCESS.Oft have I brooded on defeat and pain,The pathos of the stupid, stumbling throng.These I ignore to-day and only longTo pour my soul forth in one trumpet strain,One clear, grief-shattering, triumphant song,For all the victories of man's high endeavor,Palm-bearing, laureled deeds that live forever,The splendor clothing him whose will is strong.Hast thou beheld the deep, glad eyes of oneWho has persisted and achieved?  Rejoice!On naught diviner shines the all-seeing sun.Salute him with free heart and choral voice,'Midst flippant, feeble crowds of spectres wan,The bold, significant, successful man.              THE NEW COLOSSUS.*Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,With conquering limbs astride from land to land;Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall standA mighty woman with a torch, whose flameIs the imprisoned lightning, and her nameMother of Exiles.  From her beacon-handGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes commandThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame."Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries sheWith silent lips.  "Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to be free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"*Written in aid of the Bartholdi Pedestal Fund, 1883.             VENUS OF THE LOUVRE.Down the long hall she glistens like a star,The foam-born mother of Love, transfixed to stone,Yet none the less immortal, breathing on.Time's brutal hand hath maimed but could not mar.When first the enthralled enchantress from afarDazzled mine eyes, I saw not her alone,Serenely poised on her world-worshipped throne,As when she guided once her dove-drawn car,--But at her feet a pale, death-stricken Jew,Her life adorer, sobbed farewell to love.Here Heine wept!  Here still we weeps anew,Nor ever shall his shadow lift or move,While mourns one ardent heart, one poet-brain,For vanished Hellas and Hebraic pain.                  CHOPIN.                    I.A  dream of interlinking hands, of feetTireless to spin the unseen, fairy woof,Of the entangling waltz.  Bright eyebeams meet,Gay laughter echoes from the vaulted roof.Warm perfumes rise; the soft unflickering glowOf branching lights sets off the changeful charmsOf glancing gems, rich stuffs, dazzling snowOf necks unkerchieft, and bare, clinging arms.Hark to the music!  How beneath the strainOf reckless revelry, vibrates and sobsOne fundamental chord of constant pain,The pulse-beat of the poet's heart that throbs.So yearns, though all the dancing waves rejoice,The troubled sea's disconsolate, deep voice.                   II.Who shall proclaim the golden fable falseOf Orpheus' miracles?  This subtle strainAbove our prose-world's sordid loss and gainLightly uplifts us.  With the rhythmic waltz,The lyric prelude, the nocturnal songOf love and languor, varied visions rise,That melt and blend to our enchanted eyes.The Polish poet who sleeps silenced long,The seraph-souled musician, breathes againEternal eloquence, immortal pain.Revived the exalted face we know so well,The illuminated eyes, the fragile frame,Slowly consuming with its inward flame,We stir not, speak not, lest we break the spell.                    III.A voice was needed, sweet and true and fineAs the sad spirit of the evening breeze,Throbbing with human passion, yet divineAs the wild bird's untutored melodies.A voice for him 'neath twilight heavens dim,Who mourneth for his dead, while round him fallThe wan and noiseless leaves.  A voice for himWho sees the first green sprout, who hears the callOf the first robin on the first spring day.A voice for all whom Fate hath set apart,Who, still misprized, must perish by the way,Longing with love, for that they lack the artOf their own soul's expression.  For all theseSing the unspoken hope, the vague, sad reveries.                     IV.Then Nature shaped a poet's heart--a lyreFrom out whose chords the lightest breeze that blowsDrew trembling music, wakening sweet desire.How shall she cherish him?  Behold! she throwsThis precious, fragile treasure in the whirlOf seething passions; he is scourged and stung,Must dive in storm-vext seas, if but one pearlOf art or beauty therefrom may be wrung.No pure-browed pensive nymph his Muse shall be,An amazon of thought with sovereign eyes,Whose kiss was poison, man-brained, worldly-wise,Inspired that elfin, delicate harmony.Rich gain for us!  But with him is it well?The poet who must sound earth, heaven, and hell!             SYMPHONIC STUDIES.          (After Robert Schumann.)                  Prelude.Blue storm-clouds in hot heavens of mid-July  Hung heavy, brooding over land and sea:  Our hearts, a-tremble, throbbed in harmonyWith the wild, restless tone of air and sky.Shall we not call him Prospero who held  In his enchanted hands the fateful key  Of that tempestuous hour's mystery,And with him to wander by a sun-bright shore,  To hear fine, fairy voices, and to flyWith disembodied Ariel once more  Above earth's wrack and ruin?  Far and nighThe laughter of the thunder echoed loud,And harmless lightnings leapt from cloud to cloud.                     I.Floating upon a swelling wave of sound,  We seemed to overlook an endless sea:  Poised 'twixt clear heavens and glittering surf were we.We drank the air in flight: we knew no boundTo the audacious ventures of desire.  Nigh us the sun was dropping, drowned in gold;  Deep, deep below the burning billows rolled;And all the sea sang like a smitten lyre.Oh, the wild voices of those chanting waves!  The human faces glimpsed beneath the tide!Familiar eyes gazed from profound sea-caves,  And we, exalted, were as we had died.We knew the sea was Life, the harmonious cryThe blended discords of humanity.                     II.Look deeper yet: mark 'midst the wave-blurred mass,  In lines distinct, in colors clear defined,  The typic groups and figures of mankind.Behold within the cool and liquid glassBright child-folk sporting with smooth yellow shells,  Astride of dolphins, leaping up to kiss  Fair mother-faces.  From the vast abyssHow joyously their thought-free laughter wells!  Lulled by the overwhelming water's sound,And some make mouths at dragons, undismayed.  Oh dauntless innocence!  The gulfs profoundReecho strangely with their ringing glee,And with wise mermaids' plaintive melody.                     III.What do the sea-nymphs in that coral cave?  With wondering eyes their supple forms they bend  O'er something rarely beautiful.  They lendTheir lithe white arms, and through the golden waveThey lift it tenderly.  Oh blinding sight!  A naked, radiant goddess tranced in sleep,  Full-limbed, voluptuous, 'neath the mantling sweepOf auburn locks that kiss her ankles white!Upward they bear her, chanting low and sweet:  The clinging waters part before their way,Jewels of flame are dancing 'neath their feet.  Up in the sunshine, in soft foam, they layTheir precious burden, and return forlorn.Oh, bliss! oh, anguish!  Mortals, LOVE is born!                     IV.Hark! from unfathomable deeps a dirge  Swells sobbing through the melancholy air:  Where Love has entered, Death is also there.The wail outrings the chafed, tumultuous surge;Ocean and earth, the illimitable skies,  Prolong one note, a mourning for the dead,  The cry of souls not to be comforted.What piercing music!  Funeral visions rise,And send the hot tears raining down our cheek.  We see the silent grave upon the hill  With its lone lilac-bush.  O heart, be still!She will not rise, she will not stir nor speak.Surely, the unreturning dead are blest.Ring on, sweet dirge, and knell us to our rest!                     V.Upon the silver beach the undines dance  With interlinking arms and flying hair;  Like polished marble gleam their limbs left bare;Upon their virgin rites pale moonbeams glance.Softer the music! for their foam-bright feet  Print not the moist floor where they trip their round:  Affrighted they will scatter at a sound,Leap in their cool sea-chambers, nimbly fleet,And we shall doubt that we have ever seen,  While our sane eyes behold stray wreaths of mist,  Shot with faint colors by the moon-rays kissed,Floating snow-soft, snow-white, where these had been.Already, look! the wave-washed sands are bare,And mocking laughter ripples through the air.                  Epilogue.Forth in the sunlit, rain-bathed air we stepped,  Sweet with the dripping grass and flowering vine,  And saw through irised clouds the pale sun shine.Back o'er the hills the rain-mist slowly creptLike a transparent curtain's slivery sheen;  And fronting us the painted bow was arched,  Whereunder the majestic cloud-shapes marched:In the wet, yellow light the dazzling greenOf lawn and bush and tree seemed stained with blue.  Our hearts o'erflowed with peace.  With smiles we spakeOf partings in the past, of courage new,  Of high achievement, of the dreams that makeA wonder and a glory of our days,And all life's music but a hymn of praise.             LONG ISLAND SOUND.I see it as it looked one afternoonIn August,--by a fresh soft breeze o'erblown.The swiftness of the tide, the light thereon,A far-off sail, white as a crescent moon.The shining waters with pale currents strewn,The quiet fishing smacks, the Eastern cove,The semi-circle of its dark, green grove.The luminous grasses, and the merry sunIn the grave sky; the sparkle far and wide,Laughter of unseen children, cheerful chirpOf crickets, and low lisp of rippling tide,Light summer clouds fantastical as sleepChanging unnoted while I gazed thereon.All these fair sounds and sights I made my own.                   DESTINY.                    1856.Paris, from throats of iron, silver, brass,Joy-thundering cannon, blent with chiming bells,And martial strains, the full-voiced paean swells.The air is starred with flags, the chanted massThrongs all the churches, yet the broad streets swarmWith glad-eyed groups who chatter, laugh, and pass,In holiday confusion, class with class,And over all the spring, the sun-floods warm!In the Imperial palace that March morn,The beautiful young mother lay and smiled;For by her side just breathed the Prince, her child,Heir to an empire, to the purple born,Crowned with the Titan's name that stirs the heartLike a blown clarion--one more Bonaparte.                    1879.Born to the purple, lying stark and dead,Transfixed with poisoned spears, beneath the sunOf brazen Africa!  Thy grave is one,Fore-fated youth (on whom were visitedFollies and sins not thine), whereat the world,Heartless howe'er it be, will pause to singA dirge, to breathe a sigh, a wreath to flingOf rosemary and rue with bay-leaves curled.Enmeshed in toils ambitious, not thine own,Immortal, loved boy-Prince, thou tak'st thy standWith early doomed Don Carlos, hand in handWith mild-browed Arthur, Geoffrey's murdered son.Louis the Dauphin lifts his thorn-ringed head,And welcomes thee, his brother, 'mongst the dead.         FROM ONE AUGUR TO ANOTHER.So, Calchas, on the sacred Palatine,Thou thought of Mopsus, and o'er wastes of seaA flower brought your message.  I divine(Through my deep art) the kindly mockeryThat played about your lips and in your eyes,Plucking the frail leaf, while you dreamed of home.Thanks for the silent greeting!  I shall prize,Beyond June's rose, the scentless flower of Rome.All the Campagna spreads before my sight,The mouldering wall, the Caesars' tombs unwreathed,Rome and the Tiber, and the yellow light,Wherein the honey-colored blossom breathed.But most I thank it--egoists that we be!For proving then and there you thought of me.           THE CRANES OF IBYCUS.There was a man who watched the river flowPast the huge town, one gray November day.Round him in narrow high-piled streets at playThe boys made merry as they saw him go,Murmuring half-loud, with eyes upon the stream,The immortal screed he held within his hand.For he was walking in an April landWith Faust and Helen.  Shadowy as a dreamWas the prose-world, the river and the town.Wild joy possessed him; through enchanted skiesHe saw the cranes of Ibycus swoop down.He closed the page, he lifted up his eyes,Lo--a black line of birds in wavering threadBore him the greetings of the deathless dead!                 CRITIC AND POET.                   An Apologue.("Poetry must be simple, sensuous, or impassioned;this man is neither simple, sensuous, nor impassioned;therefore he is not a poet.")No man had ever heard a nightingale,When once a keen-eyed naturalist was stirredTo study and define--what is a bird,To classify by rote and book, nor failTo mark its structure and to note the scaleWhereon its song might possibly be heard.Thus far, no farther;--so he spake the word.When of a sudden,--hark, the nightingale!Oh deeper, higher than he could divineThat all-unearthly, untaught strain!  He sawThe plain, brown warbler, unabashed.  "Not mine"(He cried) "the error of this fatal flaw.No bird is this, it soars beyond my line,Were it a bird, 't would answer to my law."           ST. MICHAEL'S CHAPEL.When the vexed hubbub of our world of gainRoars round about me as I walk the street,The myriad noise of Traffic, and the beatOf Toil's incessant hammer, the fierce strainOf struggle hand to hand and brain to brain,Ofttimes a sudden dream my sense will cheat,The gaudy shops, the sky-piled roofs retreat,And all at once I stand enthralled againWithin a marble minster over-seas.I watch the solemn gold-stained gloom that creepsTo kiss an alabaster tomb, where sleepsA lady 'twixt two knights' stone effigies,And every day in dusky glory steepsTheir sculptured slumber of five centuries.              LIFE AND ART.Not while the fever of the blood is strong,The heart throbs loud, the eyes are veiled, no lessWith passion than with tears, the Muse shall blessThe poet-soul to help and soothe with song.Not then she bids his trembling lips expressThe aching gladness, the voluptuous pain.Life is his poem then; flesh, sense, and brainOne full-stringed lyre attuned to happiness.But when the dream is done, the pulses fail,The day's illusion, with the day's sun set,He, lonely in the twilight, sees the paleDivine Consoler, featured like Regret,Enter and clasp his hand and kiss his brow.Then his lips ope to sing--as mine do now.                SYMPATHY.Therefore I dare reveal my private woe,The secret blots of my imperfect heart,Nor strive to shrink or swell mine own desert,Nor beautify nor hide.  For this I know,That even as I am, thou also art.Thou past heroic forms unmoved shalt go,To pause and bide with me, to whisper low:"Not I alone am weak, not I apartMust suffer, struggle, conquer day by day.Here is my very cross by strangers borne,Here is my bosom-sun wherefrom I prayHourly deliverance--this my rose, my thorn.This woman my soul's need can understand,Stretching o'er silent gulfs her sister hand."              YOUTH AND DEATH.What hast thou done to this dear friend of mine,Thou cold, white, silent Stranger?  From my handHer clasped hand slips to meet the grasp of thine;Here eyes that flamed with love, at thy commandStare stone-blank on blank air; her frozen heartForgets my presence.  Teach me who thou art,Vague shadow sliding 'twixt my friend and me.  I never saw thee till this sudden hour.What secret door gave entrance unto thee?  What power in thine, o'ermastering Love's own power?                AGE AND DEATH.Come closer, kind, white, long-familiar friend,  Embrace me, fold me to thy broad, soft breast.Life has grown strange and cold, but thou dost bend  Mild eyes of blessing wooing to my rest.So often hast thou come, and from my sideSo many hast thou lured, I only bideThy beck, to follow glad thy steps divine.  Thy world is peopled for me; this world's bare.  Through all these years my couch thou didst prepare.Thou art supreme Love--kiss me--I am thine!               CITY VISIONS.                    I.As the blind Milton's memory of light,The deaf Beethoven's phantasy of tone,Wrought joys for them surpassing all things knownIn our restricted sphere of sound and sight,--So while the glaring streets of brick and stoneVex with heat, noise, and dust from morn till night,I will give rein to Fancy, taking flightFrom dismal now and here, and dwell aloneWith new-enfranchised senses.  All day long,Think ye 't is I, who sit 'twixt darkened walls,While ye chase beauty over land and sea?Uplift on wings of some rare poet's song,Where the wide billow laughs and leaps and falls,I soar cloud-high, free as the the winds are free.                     II.Who grasps the substance? who 'mid shadows strays?He who within some dark-bright wood reclines,'Twixt sleep and waking, where the needled pinesHave cushioned all his couch with soft brown sprays?He notes not how the living water shines,Trembling along the cliff, a flickering haze,Brimming a wine-bright pool, nor lifts his gazeTo read the ancient wonders and the signs.Does he possess the actual, or do I,Who paint on air more than his sense receives,The glittering pine-tufts with closed eyes behold,Breathe the strong resinous perfume, see the skyQuiver like azure flame between the leaves,And open unseen gates with key of gold?                  INFLUENCE.The fervent, pale-faced Mother ere she sleep,Looks out upon the zigzag-lighted square,The beautiful bare trees, the blue night-air,The revelation of the star-strewn deep,World above world, and heaven over heaven.Between the tree-tops and the skies, her sightRests on a steadfast, ruddy-shining light,High in the tower, an earthly star of even.Hers is the faith in saints' and angels' power,And mediating love--she breathes a prayerFor yon tired watcher in the gray old tower.He the shrewd, skeptic poet unawareFeels comforted and stilled, and knows not whenceFalls this unwonted peace on heart and sense.                RESTLESSNESS.*Would I had waked this morn where Florence smiles,A-bloom with beauty, a white rose full-blown,Yet rich in sacred dust, in storied stone,Precious past all the wealth of Indian isles--From olive-hoary Fiesole to feedOn Brunelleschi's dome my hungry eye,And see against the lotus-colored sky,Spring the slim belfry graceful as a reed.To kneel upon the ground where Dante trod,To breathe the air of immortalityFrom Angelo and Raphael--TO BE--Each sense new-quickened by a demi-god.To hear the liquid Tuscan speech at whiles,From citizen and peasant, to beholdThe heaven of Leonardo washed with gold--Would I had waked this morn where Florence smile!*Written before visiting Florence.

Time, about 1655.ACT. I.SCENE I.  The studio of the Spagnoletto. RIBERA at work before his canvas.  MARIA seated some distance behind him; a piece of embroidery is  in her hands, but she glances up from it incessantly toward her  father with impatient movements.MARIA.Father!(RIBERA, absorbed in his work, makes no reply; she puts by herembroidery, goes toward him and kisses him gently. He starts,looks up at her, and returns her caress).RIBERA.My child!MARIA.          Already you forget,Oh, heedless father!  Did you not promise meTo lay aside your brush to-day at noon,And tell me the great secret?RIBERA.          Ah, 't is true,I am to blame.  But it is morning yet;My child, wait still a little.MARIA.         'T is morning yet!Nay, it was noon one mortal hour ago.All patience I have sat till you should turnAnd beckon me.  The rosy angels breatheUpon the canvas; I might sit till night,And, if I spake not, you would never glanceFrom their celestial faces.  Dear my father,Your brow is  moist, and yet your hands are ice;Your very eyes are tired--pray, rest awhile.The Spagnoletto need no longer toilAs in the streets of Rome for beggars' fare;Now princes bide his pleasure.RIBERA (throws aside his brush and palette).         Ah, Maria,Thou speak'st in season.  Let me ne'er forgetThose days of degradation, when I starvedBefore the gates of palaces.  The germsStirred then within me of the perfect fruitsWherewith my hands have since enriched God's world.Vengeance I vowed for every moment's sting--Vengeance on wealth, rank, station, fortune, genius.See, while I paint, all else escapes my sense,Save this bright throng of phantasies that pressUpon my brain, each claiming from my handIts immortality.  But thou, my child,Remind'st me of mine oath, my sacred pride,The eternal hatred lodged within my breast.Philip of Spain shall wait.  I will not deignTo add to-day the final touch of lifeUnto this masterpiece.MARIA.         So! that is well.Put by the envious brush that separatesFather from daughter.  Now you are all mine own.And now--your secret.RIBERA.         Mine?  'T is none of mine;'T is thine, Maria.  John of AustriaDesires our presence at his ball to-night.MARIA.Prince John?RIBERA.         Ay, girl, Prince John.  I looked to seeA haughty joy dance sparkling in thine eyesAnd burn upon thy cheek.  But what is this?Timid and pale, thou droop'st thy head abashedAs a poor flower-girl whom a lord accosts.MARIA.Forgive me.  Sure, 't is you Don John desiresThe prince of artists--RIBERA.         Art!  Prate not of art!Think'st thou I move an artist 'midst his guests?As such I commune with a loftier race;Angels and spirits are my ministers.These do I part aside to grace his halls;A Spanish gentleman--and so, his peer.MARIA.Father, I am not well; my head throbs fast,Unwonted languor weighs upon my frame.RIBERA.Anger me not, Maria.  'T is my will,Thou shalt obey.  Hell, what these women be!No obstacle would daunt them in the questOf that which, freely given, they reject.Hold!  Haply just occasion bids thee seemUnlike thyself.  Speak fearlessly child;Confide to me thy knowledge, thy surmise.MARIA (hurriedly).No, father, you were right.  I have no cause;Punish me--nay, forgive, and I obey.RIBERA.There spake my child; kiss me and be forgiven.Sometimes I doubt thou playest upon my loveWillfully, knowing me as soft as clay,Whom the world knows of marble.  In such moods,I see my spirit mirror's first, and thenFrom thy large eyes thy sainted mother's soulUnclouded shine.MARIA.         Can I be like to her?I only knew her faded, white, and grave,And so she still floats vaguely through my dreams,With eyes like your own angels', and a browWorthy an aureole.RIBERA.         An earthly crown,My princess, might more fitly rest on thine.Annicca hath her colors, blue-black hair,And pale, brown flesh, and gray, untroubled eyes;Yet thou more often bring'st her to mind,For all the tawny gold of thy thick locks,Thy rare white face, and brilliant Spanish orbs.Thine is her lisping trick of voice, her laugh,The blithest music still this side of heaven;Thine her free, springing gait, though therewithalA swaying, languid motion all thine own,Recalls Valencia more than Italy.Like and unlike thou art to her, as stillMy memory loves to hold her, as she firstBeamed like the star of morning on my life.Hot, faint, and footsore, I had paced since dawnThe sun-baked streets of Naples, seeking work,Not alms, despite the beggar that I looked.Now 't was nigh vespers, and my suit had metWith curt refusal, sharp rebuff, and gibes.Praised be the saints! for every drop of gallIn that day's brimming cup, I have upheldA poisoned beaker to another's lips.Many a one hath the Ribera taughtTo fare a vagabond through alien streets;A god unrecognized 'midst churls and clowns,With kindled soul aflame, and body faintOr lack of bread.  Domenichino knows,And Gessi, Guido, Annibal Caracci--MARIA.Dear father, calm yourself.  You had begunTo tell me how you saw my mother first.RIBERA.True, I forgot it not.  Why, I AM calm;The old man now can well be grave and cold,Or laugh at his own youth's indignities,Past a long lifetime back.  'T was vespers' hour,Or nigh it, when I reached her father's door.Kind was his greeting, the first cordial wordsI heard in Naples; but I took small heedOf speech or toe, for all my sense was raptIn wonder at the angel by his sideWho smiled upon me.  Large, clear eyes that heldThe very soul of sunlight in their depths;Low, pure, pale brow, with masses of black hairFlung loosely back, and rippling unconfinedIn shadowy magnificence belowThe slim gold girdle o'er the snow-soft gown.Vested and draped about her throat and waist and wrists,A stately lily ere the dew of mornHath passed away--such was thy mother, child.MARIA.Would I were like her!  But what said she, father?How did she plead for you?RIBERA.         Ah, cunning child,I see thy tricks; thou humorest my age,Knowing how much I love to tell this tale,Though thou hast heard it half a hundred times.MARIA.I find it sweet to hear as you to tell,Believe me, father.RIBERA.         'T was to pleasure her,Signor Cortese gave me all I lackedTo prove my unfamed skill.  A savage pride,Matched oddly with my rags, the haughtinessWherewith I claimed rather than begged my tools,And my quaint aspect, oft she told me since,Won at a glance her faith.  Before I left,She guessed my need, and served me meat and wineWith  her own flower-white hands.  The parting graceI craved was granted, that my work might beThe portrait of herself.  Thou knowest the rest.MARIA.Why did she leave us, father?  Oh, how oftI yearn to see her face, to hear her voice,Hushed in an endless silence!  Strange that she,Whose rich love beggared our return, should bearSuch separation!  Though engirdled nowBy heavenly hosts of saints and seraphim,I cannot fancy it.  What! shall her child,Whose lightest sigh reechoed in her heart,Have need of her and cry to her in vain?RIBERA.Now, for God's sake, Maria, speak not thus;Let me not see such tears upon thy cheek.Not unto us it has been given to guessThe peace of disembodied souls like hers.The vanishing glimpses that my fancies catchThrough heaven's half-opened gates, exalt even me,Poor sinner that I am.  And what are these,The painted shadows that make all my lifeA glory, to the splendor of that light?For thee, my child, has not my doting loveSufficed, at least in part, to fill the breachOf that tremendous void?  What dost thou lack?What help, what counsel, what most dear caress?What dost thou covet?  What least whim remainsUngratified, because not yet expressed?MARIA.None, none, dear father!  Pardon me!  Thy love,Generous and wise as tender, shames my powerTo merit or repay.  Fie o my lips!Look if they be not blistered.  Let them smoothWith contrite kisses the last frown away.We must be young to-night--no wrinkles then!Genius must show immortal as she is.RIBERA.Thou wilt unman me with thy pretty ways.I had forgot the ball.  Yea, I grow old;This scanty morning's work has wearied me.Once I had thought it play to dream all dayBefore my canvas and then dance till dawn,And now must I give o'er and rest at noon.[Rises.]  Enter LUCA, ushering in LORENZO, who carries a portfolio.LUCA.Signor Lorenzo.[LORENZO ceremoniously salutes RIBERA and MARIA.  Exit LUCA.]LORENZO.         Master, I bring my sketch.[Opens his portfolio and hands a sketch to RIBERA.]RIBERA.Humph! the design is not so ill-conceived;I note some progress; but your drawing's bad--Yes, bad, sir.  Mark you how this leg hangs limp,As though devoid of life; these hands seem clenched,Not loosely clasped, as you intended them.[He takes his pencil and makes a few strokes.Thus should it stand--a single line will mend.And here, what's this?  Why, 't is a sloven's work.You dance too many nights away, young gallant.You shirk close labor as do all your mates.You think to win with service frivolous,Snatched 'twixt your cups, or set between two kisses,The favor of the mistress of the world.LORENZO.Your pardon, master, but you do me wrong.Mayhap I lack the gift.  Alas, I fear it!But not the patience, not the energyOf earnest, indefatigable toil,That help to make the artist.RIBERA.         'S death!  He daresBelie me, and deny the testimonyOf his own handiwork, whose every lineBetrays a sluggard soul, an indolent will,A brain that's bred to idleness.  So be it!Master Lorenzo tells the SpagnolettoHis own defects and qualities!  'T were bestHe find another teacher competentTo guide so apt, so diligent a scholar.MARIA.Dear father, what hath given thee offence?Cast but another glance upon the sketch;Surely it hath some grace, some charm, some promise.RIBERA.Daughter, stand by!  I know these insolent slipsOf young nobility; they lack the stuffThat makes us artists.  What! to answer me!When next I drop a hint as to his colors,The lengthening or the shortening of a stroke,He'll bandy words with me about his error,To prove himself the master.LORENZO.         If my defectBe an hereditary grain i' the blood,Even as you say, I must abide by it;But if patrician habits more than birthBeget such faults, then may I dare to hope.Not mine, I knew, I felt, to clear new paths,To win new kingdoms; yet were I contentWith such achievement as a strenuous will,A firm endeavor, unfaltering love,And an unwearying spirit might attain.Cast me not lightly back.  Banish me notFrom this, my home of hope, of inspiration!MARIA.What, my ungentle father!  Will you hear,And leave this worthy signor's suit unanswered?RIBERA.Well, he may bide.  Sir, I will speak with youAnon upon this work.  I judged in haste.Yea, it hath merit.  I am weary now;To-morrow I shall be in fitter moodTo give you certain hints.[LORENZO bows his thanks and advances to address MARIA.  RIBERAsilences and dismisses him with a wave of the hand.  Exit LORENZO.]RIBERA.         Should I o'ersleepMine hour, Maria, thou must awaken me;But come what may, I will be fresh to-night,To triumph in thy triumph.[Exit RIBERA.]MARIA (alone).         Could I have told,Then when he bade me?  Nay, what is to tell?He had flouted me for prizing at such heightHomage so slight from John of Austria, even.A glance exchanged, a smile, a fallen flowerDropped from my hair, and pressed against his lips.The Prince! my father gloats upon that name.Were he no more than gentleman, I thinkI should be glad.  I cannot tell to-dayIf I be sad or gay.  Now could I weepWarm, longing tears; anon, a fire of joyLeaps in my heart and dances through my veins.Why should I nurse such idle thoughts?  TonightWe are to meet again.  Will he remember?--Nay, how should he forget?  His heart is young;His eyes do mirror loyalty.  Oh, day!Quicken thy dull, slow round of tedious hours!God make me beautiful this happy night!My father's sleeping saint rebukes my thought.Strange he has left his work, against his wont,Revealed before completed.  I will drawThe curtain.[She stands irresolute before the picture with her hand on thecurtain.]         Beautiful, oh, beautiful!The far, bright, opened heavens--the dark earth,Where the tranced pilgrim lies, with eyelids sealed,His calm face flushed with comfortable sleep,His weary limbs relaxed, his heavy headPillowed upon the stone.  Oh, blessed dreamThat visits his rapt sense, of airy forms,Mounting, descending on the shining ladder,With messages of peace.  I will be trueUnto my lineage divine, and breatheThe passion of just pride that overfillsHIS soul inspired.  While she stands before the canvas, reenter, unperceived by  her, LORENZO.LORENZO.         Oh, celestial vision!What brush may reproduce those magic tints,Those lines ethereal?--MARIA (turns suddenly).         Is it not marvellous,Signor Lorenzo?  I would draw the curtain,But, gazing, I forgot.         You are the first,After the master and myself, to lookUpon this wonder.LORENZO (with enthusiasm, looking for he first time at the picture).         Ah, what an answer thisFor envious minds that would restrict his powerTo writhing limbs and shrivelled flesh!  Repose,Beauty, and large simplicity are here.Yes, that is art!  Before such work I standAnd feel myself a dwarf.MARIA.         There, you are wrong.My father even, who knows his proper worth,Before his best achievements I have seenIn like dejection; 't is the curse of genius.Oft have I heard the master grace your nameWith flattering addition.LORENZO.         'T is your goodness,And not the echo of his praise, that speaks.My work was worthless--'t was your generous voiceAlone secured the master's second glance.MARIA.Nay, signor, frankly, he esteems your talent.Because you are of well-assured meansAnd gentle birth, he will be rude to you.Not without base is the deep grudge he owesTo riches and prosperity.LORENZO.         Signora,Why do I bear such harsh, injurious termsAs he affronts me with?  Why must I seemIn mine own eyes a craven?  Spiritless,Dishonorably patient?  'T is not his fame,His power, his gift, his venerable yearsThat bind me here his willing slave.  Maria,'T is thou, 't is thou alone! 'T is that I love thee,And exile hence is death![A pause.  He kneels at her feet.  She looks at him kindly butmakes no reply.]         At thy dear feetI lay my life with its most loyal service,The subject of thy pleasure.MARIA (tenderly).         You are too humble.LORENZO.Too humble!  Do you seek mine utter ruin,With words whose very tone is a caress?I say all.  I love you!--you have known it.Why should I tell you?  Yet, to-day you seemOther than you have been.  A milder lightBeams from your eyes--a gentler grace is thronedUpon your brow--your words fall soft as dewTo melt my fixed resolve.MARIA.         You find me, signor,In an unguarded mood.  I would be trueTo you; and to myself; yet, know no answer.Anon, I will be calm; pray you withdraw.LORENZO.Till when?  Remember what mad hopes and fearsMeantime will riot in my brain.MARIA.         To-morrow--Farewell, farewell.LORENZO (kisses her hand).         Farewell.[Exit.]MARIA.         A faithful heart,A name untainted, a fair home--yea, theseAre what I need.  Oh, lily soul in heaven,Who wast on earth my mother, guide thy child!  While MARIA sits rapt in thought, enter from behind her, ANNICCA,  who bends over her and kisses her brow.ANNICCA.What, sister! lost in dreams by daylight?  Fie!Who is the monarch of thy thoughts?MARIA (starting).         Annicca!My thoughts are bounden to no master yet;They fly from earth to heaven in a breath.Now are they all of earth.  Hast heard the tidings?ANNICCA.Yea--of the Prince's ball?  We go together.Braid in thy hair our mother's pearls, and wearThe amulet ingemmed with eastern stones;'T will bring good fortune.MARIA.         Tell me, ere we go,What manner of man is John of Austria?ANNICCA.Scarce man at all--a madcap, charming boy;Well-favored--you have seen him--exquisiteIn courtly compliment, of simple manners;You may not hear a merrier laugh than hisFrom any boatman on the bay; well-versedIn all such arts as most become his station;Light in the dance as winged-foot Mercury,Eloquent on the zither, and a masterOf rapier and--MARIA.         A puppet could be madeTo answer in all points your praise of him.Hath he no substance as of a man?ANNICCA.         Why, sister,What may that be to us?MARIA.         He is our Prince.ANNICCA.The promise of his youth is to outstripThe hero of Lepanto; bright and boldAs fire, he is the very soul, the starOf Spanish chivalry; his last achievementSeems still the flower of his accomplishments.Musician, soldier, courtier, yea, and artist."He had been a painter, were he not a prince,"Says Messer Zurbaran.  The Calderona,His actress-mother, hath bequeathed to himHer spirit with her beauty, and the powerTo win and hold men's hearts.MARIA.         I knew it, sister!His eye hath a command in it; his browSeems garlanded with laurel.ANNICCA.         What is this?You kindle with his praise, your whole heart glowsIn light and color on your face, your wordsTake wing and fly as bold as reckless birds.What! can so rash a thought, a dream so wild,So hopeless an ambition, tempt your soul?MARIA.Pray you, what thought, what dream, and what ambition?I knew not I had uttered any such.ANNICCA.Nor have you in your speech; your eyes now veiled,Where the light leaped to hear me voice his fame,Your blushes and your pallor have betrayedThat which should lie uncounted fathom deep--The secret of a woman's foolish heart.MARIA.And there it lies, my sibyl sister, still!Your plummet hath not reached it.  Yes, 't is loveFlaunts his triumphant colors in my cheek,And quickens my lame speech--but not for him,Not for the Prince--so may I vaunt his worthWith a free soul.ANNICCA.         Say on.MARIA.         A gentleman,Favored of earth and heaven, true and loving,Hath cast his heart at my imperial feet;And if to-morrow find me as to-day,I will e'en stoop and raise it to mine own.ANNICCA.Signor Vitruvio?MARIA.         Not he, indeed!Did not I say favored of earth and heaven?That should mean other gifts than bags of gold,Or a straight-featured mask.  Nor will it beAny you name, though you should name him right.Must it not lie--how many fathom deep--The secret of a woman's foolish heart?ANNICCA.Kiss me, Maria.  You are still a child.You cannot vex me, wilful as you be.Your choice, I fear not, doubtless 't will prove wise,Despite your wild wit, for your heart is pure,And you will pause with sure deliberate judgmentBefore you leave our father.MARIA.         Does love stealSo gently o'er our soul?  What if he comeA cloud, a fire, a whirlwind, to o'erbearThe feeble barriers wherewith we oppose him,And blind our eyes and wrest from us our reason?Fear not, Annicca, for in no such guiseHe visits my calm breast; but yet you speakSomewhat too sagely.  Did such cautious wisdomGuide your own fancy?ANNICCA.         Jest no more, Maria.Since I became a wife, is much made clear,Which a brief year ago was dark and vague.Tommaso loves me--we are happierThen I had dreamed; yet matching now with then,I see his love is not that large, rich passionOur father bore us.MARIA.         You regret your home?ANNICCA.No, no!  I have no wish and no regret.I speak for you.  His is a sovereign soul,And all his passions loom in huger shapeThan lesser men's.  He brooks no rivalryWith his own offspring, and toward me his loveHath ebbed, I mark, to a more even flow,While deeper, stronger, sets the powerful currentToward you alone.  Consider this, Maria,Nor wantonly discrown that sacred headOf your young love to wreathe some curled boy's brow.MARIA.Think you his wish were that I should not wed?ANNICCA.Nay, that I say not, for his pride aspiresTo see you nobly mated.MARIA (after a pause).         Him will I wedWhose name is ancient, fair, and honorable,As the Ribera's is illustrious--Him who no less than I will venerateThat white, divine old head.  In art his pupil,In love his son; tender as I to watch,And to delay the slow extinguishingOf that great light.ANNICCA.         There spake his darling child!MARIA.What is't o'clock?  If he should sleep too late--He bade me rouse him--ANNICCA.         Haste to seek him, then.'T is hard on sunset, and he looks for theeWith his first waking motion.  Till to-night.[Exeunt severally.]SCENE II.  A hall in RIBERA'S house.  Enter LUCA and FIAMETTA.FIAMETTA.But did you see her?LUCA.Nay, I saw her sister, Donna Annicca.FIAMETTA.Tush, man! never name her beside my lady Maria-Rosa.  You have lostthe richest feast in the world for hungry eyes.  Her gown of clotho' silver clad her, as it were, with light; there twinkled abouther waist a girdle stiff with stones--you would have said theybreathed.  Mine own hands wreathed the dropping pearls in her hair,and pearls again were clasped around her throat.  But no, I mighttell thee every ornament--her jeweled fan, her comb of pearls, herfloating veil of gauze, and still the best of all would escape us.LUCA.Thou speakest more like her page than her handmaiden.FIAMETTA.Thou knowest not woman truly, for all thy wit.  I speak most like awoman when I weigh the worth of beauty and rich apparel.  Heigh-ho!I have felt the need of this.  Thou, good Luca, who might havebeen my father, canst understand me?  HE was poor as thou.  Whyshouldst thou be his lackey, his slave?  My hand were as dainty ashers, if it could but be spared its daily labor.LUCA.Yes, poor child, I understand thee, and yet thou art wrong.  He ismore slave to pride than I am to him.  I know him well, Fiametta, after so many years of service, and to-day I pity him more than Ifear him.  Why, girl, my task is sport beside his toil!  If mylimbs be weary, I sleep; but I have seen him sit before his canvaswith straining eyes and the big beads standing on his brow.  Whenat last he gave o'er, and I have smoothed his pillow, and servedand soothed him, what sleep could he snatch?  His brain is hauntedwith evil visions, whereof some be merely of his own imaginings,and others the phantoms of folk who are living or have lived, andwho rouse his jealousy or mayhap his remorse, God only knows!  Ifthat be genius--to be alive to pain at every pore, to be possessedof a devil that robs you of your sleep and grants no space betweenthe hours of grinding toil--I thank the saints I am a simple man!FIAMETTA.I grant thee thou mayst be right concerning him; he hath indeed a strange, sour mien.  I shudder when he turns suddenly, as his wontis, and bends his evil eyes on me.  The holy father tells me suchwarnings come from God.  No matter how slight the service he asksof me, my flesh creeps and my limbs refuse to move, till I havewhispered an Ave.  But what of Lady Maria-Rosa?  Both heaven andearth smile upon her.  To-night she wears a poor girl's dowry, aseparate fortune, on her head, her neck, her hands, yes, on herlittle jeweled feet.  One tiny shoe of hers would make me free towed my lad.LUCA.If he have but eyes, I warrant thee he finds jewels enough in thybright face.  Tell me his name.FIAMETTA.Nay, that is my secret.LUCA.He must be a poor-souled lad if he will wait till thou hast earneda dowry.FIAMETTA.A poor-souled lad! my good Vicenzo--ah! but no matter; thou knowesthim, Luca, my Lord Lorenzo's page.  There!--is he poor, or mean, orplain, or dull?  He claims no dowry, he--but I have my pride, as wellas the great ones.LUCA.May the saints preserve thee from such as theirs!  I am heartily gladof thy good fortune.  I am not sure whether thou or Lady Marie-Rosabe the most favored.  Well, the end proves all.[Exeunt.]  Enter on one side ANNICCA and DON TOMMASO, attired for the ball;  on the other side, RIBERA.RIBERA.What do ye here, my children?  Haste away!Maria waits you for the ball; folk say'T will be the bravest show e'er seen in Naples.I warrant you the Spagnoletto bringsThe richest jewels--what say'st thou, my son?DON TOMMASO.I who have robbed you of one gem, need scarceRe-word, sir, how I prize it.RIBERA.         Why, 't is true.Robbed me, thou sayst?  So hast thou.  She was mine--The balanced beauty of her flesh and spirit,That was my garland, and I was her all,Till thou, a stranger, stole her heart's allegiance,Suborned--Forgive me, I am old, a father,Whose doting passions blind.  I am not jealous,Believe me, sir.  When we Riberas give,We give without retraction or reserve,Were it our life-blood.  I rejoice with theeThat she is thine; nor am I quite bereft,I have some treasure still.  I do repentSo heartily of my discourteous speech,That I will crave your leave before I kissYour wife's soft palm.ANNICCA (kissing him repeatedly).         Why, father, what is this?Can Don Tommaso's wife so soon forgetShe is the Spagnoletto's child?RIBERA.         Enough.I can bear praise, thou knowest, from all save theeAnd my Maria.  My grave son, I fear,Will mock these transports.  Pray go in with me.No one of us but has this night a triumph.Let us make ready.[Exeunt.]ACT II.SCENE I.  Ball in the Palace of DON JOHN.  Dance.  DON JOHN and MARIA  together. DON TOMMASO, ANNICCA.  LORDS and LADIES, dancing or  promenading.1st LORD.Were it not better to withdraw awhile,After our dance, unto the torch-lit gardens?The air is fresh and sweet without.1st LADY.         Nay, signor.I like this heavy air, rich with warm odors,The broad, clear light, the many-colored throng.I might have breathed on mine own balconyThe evening breeze.1st LORD.         Still at cross purposes.When will you cease to flout me?1st LADY.         When I prizeA lover's sigh more dear than mine own pleasure.See, the Signora Julia passed again.She is far too pale for so much white, I find.Donna Aurora--ah, how beautiful!That spreading ruff, sprinkled with seeds of gold,Becomes her well.  Would you believe it, sir,Folk say her face is twin to mine--what think you?1st LORD.For me, the huge earth holds but one such face.You know it well.1St LADY.         The hall is overfilled;Go we without.[They pass on.]2d LADY.         Thrice he hath danced with her.She is not one of us--her face is strange;Colored and carven to meet most men's desire--Is't not, my lord?  Certes, it loses naughtFor lack of ornament.  Pray, ask her name,If but for my sake.2d LORD.         I have already asked.She is the daughter to the Spagnoletto,Maria-Rosa.2d LADY.         Ah, I might have guessed.The form and face are matched with the apparel,As in a picture.  'T was the master's hand,I warrant you, arranged with such quaint art,Such seeming-careless care, the dead, white pearlsWithin her odd, bright hair.[They pass on.]DON JOHN.          Now hope, now fearReigned lord of my wild dreams.  One name still sangLike the repeated strain of some caged bird,Its sweet, persistent music through my brain.One vanishing face upon the empty airShone forth and faded night and day.  And you,Did you not find me hasty, over-bold?Nay, tell me all your thought.MARIA.         You know, my lord,I am no courtier, and belike my thoughtMight prove too rustic for a royal ear.DON JOHN.         Speak on, speak on!Though you should rail, your voice would still outsingRebeck and mandoline.MARIA.         Is it not strange?I knew you not, albeit I might have guessed,If only from the simple garb of black,And golden collar, 'midst the motley huesOf our gay nobles.  I know not what besides,But this first won me.  Be not angered, sir;But, as I looked, I never ranked you higherThan simple gentleman.  I asked your name;Then, when you Highness stooped to pick my flower,My lord, that moment was my thought a traitor,For it had fain discrowned you.DON JOHN.         May God's angelsReward such treason.  Say me those words again.Let the rich blush born of that dear confessionAgain dye cheek and brow, and fade and meltForever, even as then.MARIA.We are watched, my lord.This is no place, no hour, for words like these.DON JOHN.When, where then, may we meet?[They pass on.]SCENE II.  The Palace Gardens.  Interrupted sounds of music and revelry  come though the open windows of the ball-room, seen in the  background.  RIBERA, pacing the stage, occasionally pausing  to look in upon the dancers.RIBERA.This is revenge.  Is she not beautiful,Ye gods?  The beggar's child matched with a prince!Throb not so high, my heart, 'neath envious eyesFixed on thy triumph!  Now am I well repaidFor my slow, martyred years.  Was I not wrungby keener tortures than my savage brush,Though dipped in my heart's blood, might reproduce!No twisted muscle, no contorted limb,No agony of flesh, have I yet drawn,That owed not its suggestion to some pangOf my  pride crucified, my spirit racked,My entrails gnawed by the blind worm of hate,Engendered of oppression.  That is past,But not forgotten; though to-night I pleaseTo yield to gentler influence, to ownThe strength of beauty and the power of joy,And welcome gracious phantasies that throngAnd hover over me in airy shapes.The spirits of earth and heaven contend to-nightFor mastery within me; ne'er beforeHave I been more the Spagnoletto, firedWith noble wrath, with the consuming feverAnd fierce delight of vengeance.         From this pointI see her clearly--the auroral faceA-light with smiles, the imperial head upraised;Her languid hand sways the broad, silken fan,Whose wing-like movement stirs above her browThe fine, bright curls, as though warm airs of heavenAround her breathed.  He leads her 'midst the throng.So, they have gone; but I will follow them,And watch them from afar.[Exit.]  Enter from the opposite side DON JOHN and MARIA.DON JOHN.         I dread to askWhat quivers on my lips.  My heart is free,But thine?MARIA.My heart is free, my lord.DON JOHN.         Thank God!MARIA.It never beat less calmly at the soundOf any voice till now.  I laugh to thinkThis very morn I fancied it had metIts master.DON JOHN.         Ah!MARIA.         Fear naught--a simple boy,A pupil of my father's.DON JOHN.         I was madTo dream it could be otherwise.  Forgive me;I, a mere stranger in they life, am jealousOf all thy present and thy past.MARIA.         Listen, my lord;You shall hear all.  What hour, think you, he choseTo urge his cause?  The same wherein I learnedYour Highness had commanded for to-nightOur presence.  My winged thoughts were flying backTo Count Lodovico's; again I saw you,My white rose at your lips, your grave eyes fixedMost frankly, yet most reverently, on mine.Again my heart sank as I heard the name,The Prince of Austria; and while I mused,He spake of love.  Oh, I am much to blame!My mood was soft;--although I promised naught,I listened, yea, I listened.  Good, my lord,Do you not pity him?DON JOHN.         Thanks, and thanks again,For thy confession!  Now no spot remainsOn the unblemished mirror of my faith.Since that dear night, I with one only thoughtHave gained the sum of knowledge and opinionsTouching thine honored father, with such scrapsAs the gross public voice could dole to meConcerning thine own far-removed, white life.Thou art, I learn, immured in close seclusion;Thy father, be it with all reverence said,Hedges with jealous barriers his treasure;Whilst thou, most duteous, tenderest of daughters,Breath'st but for him.MARIA.         Dear father!  Were it so,'T were simple justice.  Ah, if you knew him--A proud, large, tameless heart.  This is the cloisterWhere he immures me--Naples' gayest revels;The only bar wherewith he hedges meIs his unbounded trust, that leaves me free.Let us go in; the late night air is chill.DON JOHN.Yet one more dance?MARIA.   You may command, my lord.[Exeunt.]  Enter RIBERA.RIBERA.I lost them in the press.  Ah, there they danceAgain together.  I would lay my handsIn blessing on that darling, haughty head.Like the Ribera's child, she bears her honorsAs lightly as a flower.  Yet there glowsUnwonted lustre in her starry eyes,And richer beauty blushes on her cheek.Enough.  Now must I strive to fix that formThat haunts my brain--the blind, old Count Camillo,The Prince's oracle. 'Midst the thick throngMy fancy singled him; white beard, white hair,Sealed eyes, and brow lit by an inward light.So will I paint mine Isaac blessing Esau,While Jacob kneels before him--blind, betrayedBy his own flesh!  As RIBERA stands aside, lost in thought, enter DON JOHN and MARIA.MARIA.         See the impatient dayWakes in the east.DON JOHN.         One moment here, signora,Breathe we the charm of this enchanted night.Look where behind yon vines the slow moon sets,Hidden from us, while every leaf hangs black,Each tender stalk distinct, each curling edgeAgainst the silver sky.MARIA (perceiving RIBERA).         What, father! here?RIBERA.Maria!--Ah, my Prince, I crave your pardon.When thus I muse, 't is but my mind that lives;Each outward sense is dead.  I saw you not,I heard nor voice nor footstep.  Yonder linesThat streak the brightening sky east warn us away.For all your grace to us, the SpagnolettoProffers his thanks to John of Austria.My daughter, art thou ready?DON JOHN.         I am bound,Illustrious signor, rather unto youAnd the signora, past all hope of payment.When may I come to tender my poor homageTo the Sicilian master?RIBERA.         My lord will jest.Our house is too much honored when he deignsO'erstep the threshold.  Let your royal pleasureAlone decide the hour.DON JOHN.         To-morrow, then.Or I should say to-day, for dawn is nigh.RIBERA.And still we trespass.  Be it as you will;We are your servants.MARIA.          So, my lord, good-night.[Exeunt MARIA and RIBERA.]DON JOHN (alone).Gods, what a haughty devil rules that man!As though two equal princes interchangedImperial courtesies!  The SpagnolettoThanks John of Austria!  Louis of FranceMight so salute may father.  By heaven, I know notWhat patience or what reverence withheldMy enchafed spirit in bounds of courtesy.Nay, it was she, mine angel, whose mere aspectIs balm and blessing.  How her love-lit eyesBurned through my soul!  How her soft hand's slight pressureTingled along my veins!  Oh, she is worthyA heart' religion!  How shall I wear the hoursEre I may seek her?  Lo, I stand and dream,While my late guests await me.  Patience, patience![Exeunt.]SCENE III.  Morning twilight in RIBERA'S Garden.  During this scene the day  gradually breaks, and at the close the full light of morning  illuminates the stage.  LORENZO.  AUBADE.LORENZO (sings).  From thy poppied sleep awake;    From they golden dreams arise;  Earth and seas new colors take,    Love-light dawns in rosy skies,Weird night's fantastic shadows are outworn;Why tarriest thou, oh, sister to the morn?  Hearken, love! the matin choir    Of birds salutes thee, and with these  Blends the voice of my desire.    Unto no richer promisesOf deeper, dearer, holier love than mine,Canst thou awaken from they dreams divine.  Lo, thine eastern windows flame,    Brightening with the brightened sky;  Rise, and with thy beauty shame    Morning's regal pageantry,To thrill and bless as the reviving sun,For my heart gropes in doubt, though night be gone.(He speaks.)Why should I fear?  Her soul is pledged to mine,Albeit she still withheld the binding word.How long hath been the night! but morn breathes hope."I fain were true to you and to myself"--Did she say thus? or is my fevered brainThe fool of its desires?  The world swam;The blood rang beating in mine ears and roaredLike rushing waters; yet, as through a dream,I saw her dimly.  Surely on her lidsShone the clear tears.  As there's a God in heaven,She spake those words!  My lips retain the touchOf those soft, snow-cold hands, neither refusedNor proffered.  Such things ARE, nor can they beForgotten or foreknown.  Yes, she is mine.But soft!  Her casement opes.  Oh, joy, 't is she!Pale, in a cloud of white she stands and drinksThe morning sunlight.MARIA (above at the window).         Ah, how sweet this airKisses my sleepless lids and burning temples.I am not weary, though I found no rest.My spirit leaps within me; a new gloryBlesses the dear, familiar scene--ripe orchard,The same--yet oh, how different!  Even I thoughtSoft music trembled on the listening air,As though a harp were touched, blent with low song.Sure, that was phantasy.  I will descend,Visit my flowers, and see whereon the dewHangs heaviest, and what fairest bud hath bloomedSince yester-eve.  Why should I court reposeAnd dull forgetfulness, while the large earthWakes no lesser joy than mine?[Exit from above.]LORENZO.         Oh, heart!How may my breast contain thee, with thy burdenOf too much happiness?  Enter MARIA below; LORENZO springs forward to greet her; she  shrinks back in a sort of terror.LORENZO.         Good-day, sweet mistress.May the blithe spirit of this auspicious mornBecome the genius of thy days to come,Whereof be none less beautiful than this.Why art thou silent?  Does not love inspireJoyous expression, be it but a sigh,A song, a smile, a broken word, a cry?Thou hast not granted me the promised pledgeFor which I hunger still.  I would confirmWith dear avowals, frequent seals of love,That which, though sure, I yet can scarce believe.MARIA.Somewhat too sure, I think, my lord Lorenzo.I scarce deemed possible that one so shyBut yester-morn should hold so high a mien,Claiming what ne'er was given.LORENZO.         Maria!MARIA.         Sir,You are a trifle bold to speak my nameFamiliarly as no man, save my fatherOr my own brother, dares.LORENZO.         Ah, now I seeYour jest.  You will not seem so lightly wonWithout a wooing?  You will feign disdain,Only to make more sweet your rich concession?Too late--I heard it all.  "A new light shinesOn the familiar scene."  What may that be,Save the strange splendor of the dawn of love?Nay, darling, cease to jest, lest my poor heart,Hanging 'twixt hell and heaven, in earnest break.MARIA.Here is no jest, sir, but a fatal error,Crying for swift correction.  You surprise meWith rude impatience, ere I have found timeTo con a gentle answer.  Pardon meIf any phrase or word or glance of mineHath bred or nourished in your heart a hopeThat you might win my love.  It cannot be.LORENZO.A word, a glance!  Why, the whole frozen statueWarmed into life.  Surely it was not you.You must have bribed some angel with false prayersTo wear your semblance--nay, no angel served,But devilish witchcraft--MARIA.         Sir, enough, enough!I hoped to find here peace and solitude.These lacking, I retire.  Farewell.[Going toward the house.]LORENZO.         Signora,I will not rob you of your own.  Farewell to you.[Exit.]MARIA.Where have you flown, bright dreams?  Has that rude handSufficed to dash to naught your frail creations?Sad thoughts and humors black now fill my soul.So his rough foot hath bruised the dewy grass,And left it sere.  Why should his harsh words touch me?The truth of yesterday is false to-day.How could I know, dear God!  How might I guessThe bitter sweetness, the delicious pain!A new heart fills my breast, as soft and weakAnd melting as a tear, unto its lord;But kindled with quick courage to endure,If I need front for him, a world of foes.If this be love, ah, what a hell is theirsWho suffer without hope!  Even I, who holdSo many dear assurances, who hearStill ringing in mine ears such sacred vows,Am haunted with an unaccustomed doubt,Not wonted to go hand-in-hand with joy.A gloomy omen greets me with the morn;I, who recoil from pain, must strike and wound.What may this mean?  Help me, ye saints of heavenAnd holy mother, for my strength is naught!  She falls on her knees and bursts into tears.  Reenter LORENZO.LORENZO (aside).Thank heaven, I came.  How have I wrung her soul!A noble love, forsooth! A blind, brute passion,That being denied, is swift transformed to hateNo whit more cruel.  (To Maria.)  Lady!MARIA (rising hastily).         Signor Lorenzo!Again what would you with me?LORENZO.         No such suitAs late I proffered, but your gracious pardon.MARIA.Rise, sir, forgiven.  I, too, have been to blame,Although less deeply than you deemed.  ForbearTo bind your life.  I feel myself unworthyOf that high station where your thoughts enthrone me.Yet I dare call myself your friend.[Offering him her hand, which LORENZO presses to his lips.]LORENZO.         Thanks, thanks!Be blessed, and farewell.[Exit.]  Enter RIBERA, calling.RIBERA.         Daughter! Maria!MARIA.Why, father, I am here (kissing him).  Good-day.  What will you?RIBERA.Darling, no more than what I always will.Before I enter mine own world removed,I fain would greet the dearest work of God.I missed you when I rose.  I sought you firstIn your own chamber, where the lattice, oped,Let in the morning splendor and smellsOf the moist garden, with the sound of voices.I looked, I found you here--but not alone.What man was that went from you?MARIA.         Your disciple,My lord Lorenzo.  You remember, father,How yester-morn I pleaded for his work;Thus he, through gratitude and--love, hath watchedAll night within our garden, while I danced;And when I came to nurse my flowers--he spake.RIBERA.And you?MARIA.         Am I not still beside you, father?I will not leave you.RIBERA.         Ah, mine angel-child!I cannot choose but dread it, though I waitExpectant of the hour when you fulfilYour woman's destiny.  You have full freedom;Yet I rejoice at this reprieve, and thank theeFor thy brave truthfulness.  Be ever thus,Withholding naught from him whose heart reflectsOnly thine image.  Thou art still my pride,Even as last night when all eyes gazed thy way,Thy bearing equal in disdainful graceTo his who courted thee--thy sovereign's son.MARIA.Yea, so?  And yet it was not pride I felt,Nor consciousness of self, nor vain delightIn the world's envy;--something more than these,Far deeper, sweeter--What have I said?  My brainIs dull with sleep.  'T is only now I feelThe weariness of so much pleasure.RIBERA (rising).         Well,Go we within.  Yes, I am late to work;We squander precious moments.  Thou, go rest,And waken with fresh roses in they cheeks,To greet our royal guest.[Exeunt.]ACT III.SCENE I.  The studio of the Spagnoletto.  RIBERA before his canvas.  LUCA  in attendance.RIBERA (laying aside his brush).So! I am weary.  Luca, what 's o'clock?LUCA.My lord, an hour past noon.RIBERA.         So late already!Well, one more morning of such delicate toilWill make it ready for Madrid, and worthyNot merely Philip's eyes, but theirs whose glanceOutvalues a king's gaze, my noble friendVelasquez, and the monkish Zurbaran.Luca!LUCA.   My lord.RIBERA.         Hath the signora risen?LUCA.Fiametta passed a brief while since, and leftMy lady sleeping.RIBERA.         Good! she hath found rest;Poor child, she sadly lacked it.  She had known'Twixt dawn and dawn no respite from emotion;Her chill hand fluttered like a bird in mine;Her soft brow burned my lips.  Could that boy readThe tokens of an overwearied spirit,Strained past endurance, he had spared her still,At any cost of silence.  What is such loveTo mine, that would outrival Roman heroes--Watch mine arm crisp and shrivel in quick flame,Or set a lynx to gnaw my heart away,To save her from a needle-prick of pain,Ay, or to please her?  At their worth she ratesHer wooers--light as all-embracing airOr universal sunshine.  Luca, goAnd tell Fiametta--rather, bid the lassHither herself.[Exit Luca.]         He comes to pay me homage,As would his royal father, if he pleasedTo visit Naples; yet she too shall see him.She is part of all I think, of all I am;She is myself, no less than yon bright dreamFixed in immortal beauty on the canvas.  Enter FIAMETTA.FIAMETTA.My lord, you called me?RIBERA.         When thy mistress wakes,Array her richly, that she be preparedTo come before the Prince.FIAMETTA.         Sir, she hath risen,And only waits me with your lordship's leave,To cross the street unto St. Francis' church.RIBERA (musingly).With such slight escort?  Nay, this troubles me.Only the Strada's width?  The saints forbidThat I should thwart her holy exercise!Myself will go.  I cannot.  Bid her muffle,Like our Valencian ladies, her silk mantleAbout her face and head.[At a sign from RIBERA, exit FIAMETTA.]         Yes, God will bless her.What should I fear?  I will make sure her beautyIs duly masked.[He goes toward the casement.]         Ay, there she goes--the mantle,Draped round the stately head, discloses naughtSave the live jewel of the eye.  Unless one guessedFrom the majestic grace and proud proportions,She might so pass through the high thoroughfares.Ah, one thick curl escapes from its black prison.Alone in Naples, wreathed with rays of gold,Her crown of light betrays her.  So, she's safe!  Enter LUCA.LUCA.A noble gentleman of Spain awaitsThe master's leave to enter.RIBERA.        Show him in.[Exit LUCA.  RIBERA draws the curtain before his picture of"Jacob's Dream."]RIBERA.A gentleman of Spain!  Perchance the PrinceSends couriers to herald his approach,Or craves a longer grace.  Enter LUCA, ushering in DON JOHN unattended, completely enveloped  in a Spanish mantle, which he throws off, his face almost hidden  by a cavalier's hat.  He uncovers his head on entering.  RIBERA,  repressing a movement of surprise, hastens to greet him and kisses  his hand.RIBERA.         Welcome, my lord!I am shamed to think my sovereign's son should wait,Through a churl's ignorance, without my doors.DON JOHN.Dear master, blame him not.  I came attendedBy one page only.  Here I blush to claimSuch honor as depends on outward pomp.No royalty is here, save the crowned monarchOf our Sicilian artists.  Be it mineTo press with reverent lips my master's hand.RIBERA.Your Highness is too gracious; if you glanceRound mine ill-furnished studio, my worksShall best proclaim me and my poor deserts.Luca, uplift you hangings.DON JOHN (seating himself).         Sir, you may sit.RIBERA (aside, seating himself slowly).Curse his swollen arrogance!  Doth he imagineI waited leave of him?(Luca uncovers the picture).DON JOHN.         Oh, wonderful!You have bettered here your best.  Why, sir, he breathes!Will not those locked lids ope?--that nerveless handRegain the iron strength of sinew matedWith such heroic frame?  You have conspiredWith Nature to produce a man.  Behold,I chatter foolish speech; for such a marvelThe fittest praise is silence.[He rises and stands before the picture.]RIBERA (after a pause).         I am gladYour highness deigns approve.  Lose no more time,Lest the poor details should repay you not.Unto your royal home 't will follow you,Companion, though unworthy, to the treasuresOf the Queen's gallery.DON JOHN.         'T is another jewelSet in my father's crown, and, in his name,I thank you for it.[RIBERA bows silently.  DON JOHN glances around the studio.]DON JOHN.         There hangs a quaint, strong head,Though merely sketched.  What a marked, cunning leerGrins on the wide mouth! what a bestial glance!RIBERA.'T is but a slight hint for my larger work,"Bacchus made drunk by Satyrs."DON JOHN.         Where is that?I ne'er have seen the painting.RIBERA.         'T is not in oils,But etched in aqua-fortis.  Luca, fetch downYonder portfolio.  I can show your HighnessThe graven copy.[LUCA brings forward a large portfolio.  RIBERA looks hastilyover the engravings and draws one out which he shows to DON JOHN.]DON JOHN.         Ah, most admirable!I know not who is best portrayed--the god,Plump, reeling, wreathed with vine, in whom abidesSomething Olympian still, or the coarse Satyrs,Thoroughly brutish.  Here I scarcely miss,So masterly the grouping, so distinctThe bacchanalian spirit, your rich brush,So vigorous in color.  Do you findThe pleasure in this treatment equals thatOf the oil painting?RIBERA.         All is in my mood;We have so many petty talents, cleverTo mimic Nature's surface.  I name notThe servile copyists of the greater masters,Or of th' archangels, Raphael and Michael;But such as paint our cheap and daily marvels.Sometimes I fear lest they degrade our artTo a nice craft for plodding artisans--Mere realism, which they mistake for truth.My soul rejects such limits.  The true artistGives Nature's best effects with far less means.Plain black and white suffice him to expressA finer grace, a stronger energyThan she attains with all the aid of color.I argue thus and work with simple tools,Like the Greek fathers of our art--the sculptors,Who wrought in white alone their matchless types.Then dazzled by the living bloom of earth,Glowing with color, I return to that,My earliest worship, and compose such workAs you see there.[Pointing to the picture.]DON JOHN.         Would it be overmuch,In my brief stay in Naples, to beg of youA portrait of myself in aqua-fortis?'T would rob you, sir, of fewer golden hoursThan the full-colored canvas, and enrichWith a new treasure our royal gallery.RIBERA.You may command my hours and all that's mine.DON JOHN (rising).Thanks, generous master.  When may I returnFor the first sitting?RIBERA.         I am ready now--To-day, to-morrow--when your Highness please.DON JOHN.'T would be abuse of goodness to acceptThe present moment.  I will come to-morrow,At the same hour, in some more fitting garb.Your hand, sir, and farewell.  Salute for me,I pray you, the signora.  May I not hopeTo see and thank her for her grace to me,In so adorning my poor feast?RIBERA.         The debt is ours.She may be here to-morrow--she is free,She only, while I work, to come and go.Pray, sir, allow her--she is never crossed.I stoop to beg for her--she is the lastWho bides with me--I crave you pardon, sir;What should this be to you?DON JOHN.         'T is much to me,Whose privilege has been in this rare hour,Beneath the master to discern the man,And thus add friendship unto admiration.[He presses RIBERA'S hand and is about to pick up his mantle andhat.  LUCA springs forward, and, while he is throwing the cloakaround the Princes's shoulders, enter hastily MARIA,  enveloped inher mantilla, as she went to church.]MARIA.Well, father, an I veiled and swathed to suit you,To cross the Strada?[She throws off her mantilla and appears all in white.  She goesto embrace her father, when she suddenly perceives the Prince, andstands speechless and blushing.]RIBERA.         Child, his Royal HighnessPrince John of Austria.DON JOHN.         Good-day, signora.Already twice my gracious stars have smiled.I saw you in the street.  You wore your mantle,As the noon sun might wear a veil of cloud,Covering, but not concealing.MARIA.         I, sir, twiceHave unaware stood in your royal presence.You are welcome to my father's home and mine.I scarce need crave your pardon for my entrance;Yourself must see how well assured I feltMy father was alone.DON JOHN.         And so you hopedTo find him--shall I read your answer thus?RIBERA.Nay, press her not.  Your Highness does her wrong,So harshly to construe her simpleness.My daughter and myself are one, and bothWill own an equal pleasure if you bide.DON JOHN (seating himself).You chain me with kind words.MARIA.         My father, sir,Hath surely told you our delight and marvelAt the enchantments of your feast.  For meThe night was brief, rich, beautiful, and strangeAs a bright dream.DON JOHN.         I will gainsay you not.A beauteous soul can shed her proper gloryOn mean surroundings.  I have likewise dreamed,Nor am I yet awake.  This morn hath beenA feast for mind and eye.  Yon shepherd-prince,Whom angels visit in his sleep, shall crownYour father's brow with a still fresher laurel,And link in equal fame the Spanish artistWith the Lord's chosen prophet.RIBERA.         That may be,For in the form of that wayfarerI drew myself.  So have I slept beneathThe naked heavens, pillowed by a stone,With no more shelter than the wind-stirred branches,While the thick dews of our Valencian nightsDrenched my rude weeds, and chilled through blood and bone.Yet to me also were the heavens revealed,And angels visited my dreams.DON JOHN.         How strangeThat you, dear masters, standing on the crownOf a long life's continuous ascent,Should backward glance unto such dark beginnings.RIBERA.Obscure are all beginnings.  Yet I museWith pleasing pain on those fierce years of struggle.They were to me my birthright; all the vigor,The burning passion, the unflinching truth,My later pencil gained, I gleaned from them.I prized them.  I reclaimed their ragged freedom,Rather than hold my seat, a liveried slave,At the rich board of my Lord Cardinal.A palace was a prison till I rearedMine own.  But now my child's heart I would pierceSooner than see it bear the least of ills,Such as I then endured.DON JOHN.         Donna MariaMay smile, sir, at your threat; she is in a pleasance,Where no rude breezes blow, no shadow fallsDarker than that of cool and fragrant leaves.Yea, were it otherwise--had you not reapedThe fruit of your own works, she had not suffered.Your children are Spain's children.RIBERA.         Sir, that wordIs the most grateful you have spoken yet.Why are thou silent, daughter?MARIA (absently).         What should I say?The Prince is kind.  I scarcely heard your words.I listened to your voices, and I mused.DON JOHN (rising).I overstep your patience.MARIA.         You will be gone?What have I said?RIBERA.         You are a child, Maria.To-morrow I will wait your Highness.DON JOHN.         Thanks.To-morrow noon.  Farewell, signora.[Exit DON JOHN.]RIBERA.What ails you, daughter?  You forget yourself.Your tongue cleaves to your mouth.  You sit and muse,A statue of white silence.  Twice to-dayYou have deeply vexed me.  Go not thus againAcross the street with that light child, Fiametta.Faith, you were closely muffled.  What was this--This tell-tale auburn curl that rippled downOver the black mantilla?  Were I harsh,Suspicious, jealous, fearful, prone to wrath,Or anything of all that I am not,I should have deemed it no mere negligence,But a bold token.MARIA.         Father you make me quail.Why do you threat me with such evil eyes?Would they could read my heart!RIBERA.         Elude me not.Whom have you met beside the Prince this morn?Who saw you pass?  Whom have you spoken with?MARIA.For God's sake, father, what strange thoughts are these?With none, with none!  Beside the Prince, you say?Why even him I saw not, as you know.I hastened with veiled eyes cast on the ground,Swathed in my mantle still, I told my beads,And in like manner hasted home to you.RIBERA.Well, it may pass; but henceforth say thy matinsIn thine own room.  I know what vague cloudObscures my sight and weighs upon my brain.I am very weary. Luca, follow me.[Exeunt RIBERA and LUCA.]MARIA.Poor father!  Dimly he perceives some troubleWithin the threatening air.  Thank heaven, I calmed him,Yet I spake truth.  What could have roused so soonHis quick suspicion?  Did Fiametta seeThe wary page slip in my hand the missive,As we came forth again?  Nay, even so,My father hath not spoken with her since.Sure he knows naught; 't is but my foolish fearMakes monsters out of shadows.  I may readThe priceless lines and grave them on my heart.[She draws from her bosom a letter, reads it, and presses it toher lips.]He loves me, yes, he loves me!  Oh, my God,This awful joy in mine own breast is love!To-night he will await me in our garden.Oh, for a word, a pressure of the hand!I fly, my prince, at thy most dear behest![Exit.]SCENE II.  A room in DON TOMMASO'S HOUSE.  DON TOMMASO and ANNICCA.DON TOMMASO.Truly, you wrong your sister; she is young,Heedless, and wilful, that is all; a touchOf the Ribera's spirit fired the lass.Don John was but her weapon of revengeAgainst the malice of our haughty matrons,Who hurled this icy shafts of scorn from heightsOf dignity upon the artist's daughter.ANNICCA.I cannot think with you.  In her demeanor,Her kindled cheek, her melting eye, was moreThan sly revenge or cautious policy.If that was art, it overreached itself.Ere the night ended, I had blushed to seeSlighting regards cast on my father's child,And hear her name and his tossed lightly round.DON TOMMASO.Could you not read in such disparagementThe envy of small natures?ANNICCA.         I had as liefMaria were to dance the tarantellaUpon the quay at noonday, as to see herGazed at again with such insulting homage.DON TOMMASO.You are too strict; your baseless apprehensionsWrong her far more than strangers' jests.ANNICCA.         Not so;My timely fears prevent a greater illAnd work no harm, since they shall be impartedOnly to him who hath the power to quell them,Dissolving them to air--my father.DON TOMMASO.         How!You surely will not rouse his fatal wrath?Annicca, listen: if your doubts were true,He whose fierce love guards her with sleepless eyes,More like the passion of some wild, dumb creature,With prowling jealousy and deadly spring,Forth leaping at the first approach of ill,Than the calm tenderness of human fathers;He surely had been keen to scent the danger.I saw him at the ball--as is his wont,He mingled not among the revellers,But like her shadow played the spy on her.ANNICCA.A word would stir less deeply than you dread.DON TOMMASO.Ah, there you err; he knows no middle term.At once he would accept as fact the worstOf your imaginings; his rage would smiteAll near him, and rebound upon himself;For, as I learn, Don John brings royal ordersFor the Queen's gallery; he would dismissThe Prince as roughly as a begging artist.Make no such breach just now betwixt the courtAnd our own kindred.ANNICCA.         Be it so, Tommaso.I will do naught in haste.DON TOMMASO.         Watch thou and wait.A slight reproof might now suffice the child,Tame as a bird unto a gentle voice.ANNICCA.My mind misgives me; yet will I find patience.SCENE III.  Night in RIBERA'S Garden. DON JOHN alone.DON JOHN.In any less than she, so swift a passion,So unreserved, so reckless, had repelled.In her 't is godlike.  Our mutual loveWas born full-grown, as we gazed each on each.Nay, 't was not born, but like a thing eternal,It WAS ere we had consciousness thereof;No growth of slow development, but perfectFrom the beginning, neither doomed to end.Her garden breathes her own warm, southern beauty,Glowing with dewy and voluptuous bloom.Here I am happy--happy to dream and waitIn rich security of bliss.  I knowHow brief an interval divides us now.She hastes to meet me with no less impatienceThan mine to clasp her in my arms, to pressHeart unto heart, and see the love withinThe unfathomable depths of her great eyes.She comes.  Maria!  Enter MARIA, half timid, half joyous.MARIA.         My lord! you have been waiting?DON JOHN.Darling, not long; 't was but my restless loveThat drove me here before the promised hour.So were I well content to wait through agesUpon the threshold of a joy like this,Knowing the gates of heaven might ope to meAt any moment.MARIA.         Your love is less than mine,For I have counted every tedious minuteSince our last meeting.DON JOHN.         I had rather speakLess than the truth to have you chide me thus;Yet if you enter in the lists with me,Faith match with faith, and loyal heart with heart,I warrant you, the jealous god of love,Who spies us from yon pomegranate bush,Would crown me victor.MARIA.         Why should we compete?Who could decide betwixt two equal truths,Two perfect faiths?DON JOHN.         The worship of my lifeWill be slight payment for your boundless trust.Look we nor forth nor back, are we not happy?Heaven smiles above our heads with all her stars.The envious day forced us apart, the wingOf obscure night protects and shelters us.Now like a pure, night-blooming flower, puts forthThe perfect blossom of our love.  Oh, leanThy royal head upon my breast; assure meThat this unheard-of bliss is no fond dream.Cling to me, darling, till thy love's dear burdenTake root about my heart-strings.MARIA (after a pause).         Did you not hearA sound, a cry?  Oh, God! was it my father?DON JOHN.Naught save the beating of our hearts I heard.Be calm, my love; the very air is hushed.Listen, the tinkle of the fountain yonder,The sleepy stir of leaves, the querulous pipeOf some far bird--no more.MARIA.         I heard, I heard!A rude voice called me.  Wherefore did it comeTo snatch me from that dream of restful love?Oh, Juan, you will save me, you will help,--Tell me you will--I have lost all for you!DON JOHN.To-morrow you will laugh at fears like these.You have lost naught--you have but won my love.Lose not your faith in that--your shield and weapon.MARIA.I tremble still in every limb.  Good-night,I must be gone.  To-morrow when you come,Be wary with my father; he is fierceIn love and hatred.  Listen and look, my lord.If one dared say to me but yester-mornThat I would meet at night a stranger youthIn mine own garden, talk with him of love,And hint a thought against the Spagnoletto,I had smitten with this bauble such a one.[Pointing to a jewelled poniard in her belt.]Kiss me, my Juan, once again.  Good-night.[Exit MARIA.]SCENE IV.  The studio.  RIBERA and ANNICCA.ANNICCA.Has he come often?RIBERA.         Nay, I caught the trickOf his fair face in some half-dozen sittings.His is a bold and shapely head--it pleased me.I like the lad; the work upon his portraitWas pastime--'t is already nigh complete.ANNICCA.And has Maria sat here while you worked?RIBERA (sharply).Why not?  What would'st thou say?  Speak, fret me notWith ticklish fears.  Is she not by my side,For work or rest?ANNICCA.         Surely, I meant no harm.Father, how quick you are!  I had but askedIf she, being here, had seen the work progress,And found it his true counterpart.RIBERA.         Annicca,There is something in your thought you hold from me.Have the lewd, prying eyes, the slanderous mindOf public envy, spied herein some mischief?What hast thou heard?  By heaven, if one foul wordHave darkened the fair fame of my white dove,Naples shall rue it.  Let them not forgetThe chapel of Saint Januarius!ANNICCA (aside).Tommaso judged aright. I dare not tell him.Dear father, listen.  Pray, be calm.  Sit down;Your own hot rage engenders in my mindThoughts, fears, suspicions.RIBERA (seating himself).I am foolish, hasty; but it makes me mad.Listen to me.  Here sits the Prince before me;We talk, we laugh.  We have discussed all themes,From the great Angelo's divinity,Down to the pest of flies that fret us hereAt the day's hottest.  Sometimes he will paceThe studio--such young blood is seldom still.He brought me once his mandoline, and drewEloquent music thence.  I study thusThe changeful play of soul.  I catch the spiritBehind the veil, and burn it on the plate.Maria comes and goes--will sit awhileOver her broidery, then will haste awayAnd serve us with a dish of golden fruit.That is for me; she knows the sweet, cool juice,After long hours of work, refreshes meMore than strong wine.  She meets his Royal HighnessAs the Ribera's child should meet a Prince--Nor over bold, nor timid; one would thinkTheir rank was equal, and that neither sprangFrom less than royal lineage.ANNICCA.         Why, I know it.Here is no need to excuse or justify.Speak rather of your work--is the plate finished?RIBERA.So nigh, that were Don John to leave to-morrow,It might go with him.ANNICCA.         What! he leaves Naples?RIBERA.Yea, but I know not when; he seems to waitMomently, orders from his MajestyTo travel onward.ANNICCA (aside).         Would he were well away!RIBERA.What do you mutter?  I grow deaf this side.ANNICCA.I spake not, father.  I regret with youThe Prince should leave us; you have more enjoyedHis young companionship than any strangersThese many years.RIBERA.         Well, well, enough of him.He hath a winning air--so far, so good.I know not that I place more trust in himThan in another.  'T is a lying world;I am too old now to be duped or dazzledBy fair externals.  Enter MARIA, carrying a kirtle full of flowers.MARIA.         Father, see! my rosesHave blossomed over night; I bring you someTo prank your study.  Sister, Don TommasoSeeks you below.ANNICCA (rising).         I will go to meet him.  Father,Until to-morrow.[Embraces MARIA and exits.  MARIA sits by her father's side anddisplays her flowers.]RIBERA.         Truly, a gorgeous show!Pink, yellow, crimson, white--which is the fairest?Those with the deepest blush should best become you--Nay, they accord not with your hair's red gold;The white ones suit you best--pale, innocent,So flowers too can lie!  Is not that strange?[MARIA looks at him in mingled wonder and affright.  He roughlybrushes aside all the flowers upon the floors, than picks one upand carefully plucks it to pieces.]I think not highly of your flowers, girl;I have plucked this leaf; it has no heart.See there![He laughs contemptuously.]MARIA.         What have I done?  Alas! what mean you?Have you then lost your reason?RIBERA.         Nay, but found it.I, who was dull of wit, am keen at last."Don John is comely," and "Don John is kind;""A wonderful musician is Don John,""A princely artist"--and then , meek of mien,You enter in his presence, modest, simple.And who beneath that kitten grace had spiedThe claws of mischief?  Who!  Why, all the world,Save the fond, wrinkled, hoary fool, thy father.Out, girl, for shame!  He will be here anon;Hence to your room--he shall not find you here.Thank God, thank God! no evil hath been wroughtThat may not be repaired.  I have sat byAt all your meetings.  You shall have no more;Myself will look to that.  Away, away![Exit Maria.]RIBERA (looks after her).As one who has received a deadly hurt,She walks.  What if my doubts be false?  The terrorOf an unlooked-for blow, a treacherous thrustWhen least expected--that is all she showed.On a false charge, myself had acted thus.She had been moved far otherwise if guilty;She had wept, protested, begged--she had not leftWith such a proud and speechless show of grief.I was too harsh, too quick on slight suspicion.What did Annicca say?  Why, she said naught.'T was her grave air, her sudden reticence,Her ill-assumed indifference.  They play on me;They know me not.  They dread my violent passions,Not guessing what a firm and constant bridleI hold them with.  On just cause to be angered,Is merely human.  Yet they sound my temper;They try to lead me like some half-tamed beast,That must be coaxed.  Well, I may laugh thereat.But I am not myself to-day; strange painsShoot through my head and limbs and vex my spirit.Oh, I have wronged my child!  Return, Maria![Exit, calling.]ACT IV.SCENE I.  Night. RIBERA'S bedroom.  RIBERA discovered in his dressing-gown,  seated reading beside a table, with a light upon it. Enter from  an open door at the back of the stage, MARIA. She stands  irresolute for a moment on the threshold behind her father,  watching him, passes her hand rapidly over her brow and eyes,  and then knocks.MARIA.May I come in, dear father?RIBERA (putting down his book and looking at her affectionately).         Child, you ask?MARIA (advancing).You study late.  I came to bid good-night.RIBERA.Poor child, thou must be weary.  Thou art paleStill from thy swoon.MARIA (with a forced laugh).         I had forgotten it.Nay, I am well again.RIBERA.         But I forget it not,Neither forgive myself.  Well, it is past,Enough!  When the Prince left I sent for thee;Thou wast still sleeping?MARIA (with confusion).         Yes, I was outworn.What didst thou wish of me?RIBERA.         Merely to tell theeDon John leaves Naples.  He expressed regretMost courteously that thou wast suffering.He had fain ordered us his parting thanksFor our kind welcome--so he deigned to say.To-morrow he may steal a moment's graceTo see us both once more; but this is doubtful,So he entrusted his farewells to me.MARIA.May peace go with him.RIBERA.         We are alone--Are we not, darling?  Thanks for the calm contentWherewith thou biddest him farewell, to nestleOnce more in mine embrace.  Not long, I feel,May these old horny eyes be blest with sightOf thy full-flowering grace, these wrinkled lipsBe pressed against thy brow.  I am no moreWhat I have been; at times both hand and brainRefuse their task.  Myself will follow soon--The better part of me already dead.So the worm claims us by slow torture, child.Thou'lt bear with me, if as to-day I wrongThy gentle spirit?MARIA.         Father, no more, no more!You break my heart.RIBERA.         Mine angel-child, weep notSo bitterly.  I thought not thus to move thee.Still thou art overwrought.  I would have askedAt last a promise of thee.  I am selfish,But I would sleep less startingly o'nights,And bear a calmer soul by day, were I secureThat thou wilt bide with me until the end.[A pause.]To-night I will not press thee.  Thou art weary;Thy nerves have scarce regained their tension yet;But from thy deep emotion I can see'T will cost thee less than I have feared.  To-morrowWe will talk of this again.MARIA.         To-morrow!RIBERA.         Now,Good-night.  'T is time thou shouldst be sleeping.MARIA.         Father,I cannot leave thee!  Every word of thineGnaws like a burning coal my sore, soft heart.What! thou shalt suffer, and thine own MariaWill leave thee daughterless, uncomforted?What! thou shalt weep, and other eyes than mineShall see the Spagnoletto's spirit broken?RIBERA.There, there, poor child!  Look up, cling not so wildlyAbout my neck.  Thou art too finely touched,If thus the faint foreshadow of a griefCan overcome thee.  Listen?  What was that?MARIA (starts up, shudders violently, and, all at once, masters      her emotion).Why, I heard nothing, father.RIBERA.         Yes, a soundOf footsteps, and a stifled call.[He goes toward the casement.  MARIA tries to detain him.]MARIA.         Dear father,Surely 't was naught.  Your ears deceive you.The wind is rising, and you heard the leavesRustling together.RIBERA.         Nay, I will look forth.[He opens the casement and looks out in silence.  MARIA standsbehind him, with her hands clasped in an agony of fear.]RIBERA (calling).Hist, answer!  Who goes there? (a pause.)  No sound.  Thou'rt right,Maria; I see naught; our garden liesVacant and still, save for the swaying branchesOf bush and tree.  'T is a wild, threatening night.A sultry breeze is blowing, and the skyHangs black above Vesuvius.  Yonder cloudHath lightnings in it.  Ah, a blinding boltDims the volcano's pillared fire.  Enough.[He closes the casement and returns to MARIA.]Hark, how the thunder rolls!  My child, you trembleLike the blown leaves without.MARIA.         I am oppressedBy the same stormy influence.  Thou knowestI dread the thunder.RIBERA.         Thou, who art safely housed,Why shouldst thou dread it?  Try to sleep, my darling;Forget the terror of the tempest; mornWill break again in sunshine.MARIA.         Father, sayYou love me and you trust me once again,Before I bid good-night.RIBERA.         If it will calm thee,I love thee and I trust thee.  Thou art to meMy genius--thou, the breathing image stillOf thy saint-mother, whom the angels guard.Even as thou standest now, vested in white,With glowing eyes and pale, unsmiling face,I see her as she stood the day her heartWent forth from home and kin to bless the strangerWho craved her father's alms.MARIA.         Thanks, thanks.  Good-night.God bless us through these wild, dark hours.RIBERA.         Good-night.SCENE II.  RIBERA'S garden.  Half the sky illuminated by an over-clouded  moon, the rest obscured by an approaching storm.  Occasional  thunder and lightning.  On on side of the stage a summer-house  open to the audience, on the other side the exterior of the  dwelling.  DON JOHN discovered waiting near the house.  The door  opens, and enter MARIA.DON JOHN (springing forward and embracing her).At last! at last!MARIA.         Juan, beware!  My father's fears,I cannot guess by whom or what, are roused.[She extends her arms gropingly to embrace him.]Oh, let me feel thee near me--I see naught.Follow me; here our voices may be heard.[She hastens towards the summer-house, leaning upon his arm,and sinks upon a seat.]Have not slow ages passed with crowding woesSince we last met!  What have I not endured!Oh, Juan, save me!DON JOHN.         Dearest child, be calm.Thou art strangely overwrought.  Speak not.  AwaitTill this wild fear be past.MARIA.         How great you are!Your simple presence stills and comforts me.While you are here, the one thing real to meIn all the universe is love.DON JOHN.         And yetMy love is here, if I be far or nigh.Is this the spirit of a soldier's wife?Nay, fiery courage, iron fortitude,That soul must own that dares to say, "I love."MARIA.And I dare say it.  I can bear the worstThat envious fate may heap upon my head,If thou art with me, or for hope of thee.DON JOHN.Art sure of that?  Thou couldst not part from me,Even for thy father's sake?MARIA.         Talk you of parting?For God's sake, what is this?  You love no more?DON JOHN.Rather I love so truly that I shrinkFrom asking thee to share a soldier's fate.I tremble to uproot so fine a flowerFrom its dear native earth.  I--MARIA (putting her hand on his lips).         Hush, no more!I need no preparation more than this,Your mere request.DON JOHN.         There spake my heroine.The King, my father, bids me to repairUnto Palermo.MARIA.         Shall we sail to-night?DON JOHN.My Princess!  Thou recoilest not from allThou must endure, ere I can openlyClaim thee my wife!MARIA.         The pangs of purgatoryWere lightly borne with such a heaven in view.I were content with one brief hour a day,Snatched from the toils of war and thy high duties,To gaze on thy dear face--to feel thy hand,Even as now a stay and a caress.DON JOHN.Angel, I have no thanks.  May God forget meWhen I forget this hour!  So, thou art firm--Ready this night to leave thy home, thy kin,Thy father?MARIA (solemnly).         I am ready and resolved.Yet judge me not so lightly as to deemI say this with no pang.  My love were naught,Could I withdraw it painlessly at onceFrom him round whose colossal strength the tendrilsOf mine own baby heart were taught to twine.I speak not now as one who swerves or shrinks,But merely, dear, to show thee what sharp torturesI, nowise blind, but with deliberate soul,Embrace for thee.DON JOHN.         How can I doubt the anguishSo rude a snapping of all ties must smiteThy tender heart withal?  Yet, dwell we notOn the brief pain, but on the enduring joys.If Ribera's love be all thou deemest,He will forgive thy secret flight, thy--MARIA.         Secret!May I not bid farewell?  May I not tell himWhere we are bound?  How soon he may have hopeTo hear from me--to welcome me, thy Princess?I dare not leave him without hope.DON JOHN.         My child,Thou art mad!  We must be secret as the grave,Else are we both undone.  I have given outThat I depart in princely state to-morrow.Far from the quay a bark awaiteth us.I know my man.  Shrouded by careful night,We will set secret sail for Sicily.Once in Palermo, thou mayst write thy father--Sue for his pardon--tell him that, ere long,When I have won by cautious policyKing Philip's favor, thou shalt be proclaimedPrincess of Austria.MARIA (who has hung upon his words with trembling excitement,      covers her face with her hands, and bursts into tears).         I cannot! no! I cannot!DON JOHN (scornfully).I feared as much.  Well, it is better thus.I asked thee not to front the "worst of illsThat envious fate could heap upon thy head"--Only a little patience.  'T was too much;I cannot blame thee.  'T is a loving father.I, a mere stranger, had naught else to hope,Matching my claim with his.MARIA (looks at him and throws herself at his feet).         Oh, pardon, pardon!My Lord, my Prince, my husband!  I am thine!Lead wheresoe'er thou wilt, I follow thee.Tell me a life's devotion may effaceThe weakness of a moment!DON JOHN (raising her tenderly and embracing her).Ah, mine own!SCENE III.  Morning.  The studio.  Enter RIBERA.RIBERA.How laughingly the clear sun shines to-dayOn storm-drenched green, and cool, far-glittering seas!When she comes in to greet me, she will blushFor last night's terrors.  How she crouched and shudderedAt the mere thought of the wild war without!Poor, clinging women's souls, what need is theirsOf our protecting love!  Yet even on meThe shadow of the storm-cloud seemed to breed.Through my vexed sleep I heard the thunder roll;My dreams were ugly--  Well, all that is past;To-day my spirit is renewed.  'T is longSince I have felt so fresh.[He seats himself before his easel and takes up his brush andpalette, but holds them idly in his hand.]         Strange, she still sleeps!The hour is past when she is wont to comeTo bless me with the kiss of virgin love.Mayhap 't was fever in her eyes last nightGave them so wild a glance, so bright a lustre.God! if she should be ill![He rises and calls.]Luca!Enter LUCA.LUCA.         My lord?RIBERA.Go ask Fiametta if the mistress sleeps--If she be ailing--why she has not comeThis morn to greet me.[Exit LUCA.]RIBERA (begins pacing the stage).        What fond fears are theseMastering my spirit?  Since her mother diedI tremble at the name of pain or ill.How can my rude love tend, my hard hand soothe,The dear child's fragile--[A confused cry without.]         What is that?  My God!How hast thou stricken me![He staggers and falls into a chair.  Enter hastily FIAMETTA,weeping, and LUCA with gestures of terror and distress.]FIAMETTA.         Master!LUCA.         Dear master![RIBERA rises with a great effort and confronts them.]RIBERA.What is it?  Speak!LUCA.         Dear master, she is gone.RIBERA.How?  Murdered--dead?  Oh, cruel God!  Away!Follow me not![Exit RIBERA.]FIAMETTA.         Help, all ye saints of heaven.Have pity on him!  Oh, what a day is this!LUCA.Quiet, Fiametta.  When the master findsThe empty, untouched bed, the silent room,His wits will leave him.  Hark! was that his cry?  Reenter RIBERA calling.Maria! Daughter! Where have they taken thee,My only one, my darling?  Oh, the brigands!Naples shall bleed for this.  What do ye here,Slaves, fools, who stare upon me?  Know ye notI have been robbed?  Hence!  Ransack every houseFrom cave to roof in Naples.  Search all streets.Arrest whomso ye meet.  Let no sail stirFrom out the harbor.  Ring the alarum!  Quick!This is a general woe.[Exeunt LUCA and FIAMETTA.]         The Duke's my friend;He'll further me.  The Prince--oh, hideous fear!--No, no, I will not dream it.  Mine enemiesHave done this thing; the avengers of that beggar--Domenichino--they have struck home at last.How was it that I heard no sound, no cry,Throughout the night?  The heavens themselves conspiredAgainst me--the hoarse thunder drowned her shrieks!Oh, agony![He buries his face in his hands.  Enter ANNICCA; she throwsherself speechless and weeping upon his neck.]         Thou knowest it, Annicca!The thief has entered in the night--she's gone.I stand and weep; I stir not hand or foot.Is not the household roused?  Do they not seek her?I am helpless, weak; an old man overnight.The brigands' work was easy.  I heard naught.But surely, surely, had they murdered her,I had heard that--that would have wakened meFrom out my grave.ANNICCA.         Father, she is not dead.RIBERA (wildly).Where have they found her?  What dost thou know?  Speak, speak,Ere my heart break!ANNICCA.         Alas! they have not found her;But that were easy.  Nerve thyself--rememberThou art the Spagnoletto still.  Last nightDon John fled secretly from Naples.RIBERA.         Ah!Give me a draft of water.[He sinks down on his chair.]ANNICCA (calling).         Help, Tommaso!Luca! Fiametta! Father, lookup, look up!Gaze not so hollowly.  Enter DON TOMMASO and SERVANTS.         Quick! water, water!Do ye not see he swoons?[She kneels before her father, chafing and kissing his hands. ExitLUCA, who returns immediately with a silver flagon of water. ANNICCAseizes it and raises it to RIVERA'S lips.  He takes it from her handand drinks.]RIBERA.         How your hand trembles!See, mine is firm.  You had spilt it o'er my beardHad I not saved it.  Thanks.  I am strong again.I am very old for such a steady grasp.Why, girl, most men as hoary as thy fatherAre long since palsied.  But my firm touch comesFrom handling of the brush.  I am a painter,The Spagnoletto--[As he speaks his name he suddenly throws off his apathy, risesto his full height, and casts the flagon to the ground.]         Ah, the Spagnoletto,Disgraced, abandoned!  My exalted nameThe laughing-stock of churls; my hearthstone stampedWith everlasting shame; my pride, my fame,Mine honor--where are they?  With yon spilt water,Fouled in the dust, sucked by the thirsty air.Now, by Christ's blood, my vengeance shall be hugeAs mine affront.  I will demand full justiceFrom Philip.  We will treat as King with King.HE shall be stripped of rank and name and wealth,Degraded, lopped from off the fellowshipOf Christians like a rotten limb, proclaimedThe bastard that he is.  She shall go with him,Linked in a common infamy, haled round,A female Judas, who betrayed her father,Her God, her conscience, with a kiss.  Her shadowShall be my curse.  Cursed be her sleep by night,Accursed her light by day--her meat and drink!Accursed the fruit of her own womb--the graveWhere she will lie!  Cursed-- Oh, my child, my child![He throws himself on the floor and buries his head among thecushions of the couch.  DON TOMMASO advances and lays his hand on RIBERA'S shoulder.]DON TOMMASO.Mine honored sir--RIBERA (looks up without rising).         Surely you mock me, signor.Honored!  Yes, honored with a rifled home,A desecrated heart, a strumpet child.For honors such as these, I have not stintedSweat, blood, or spirit through long years of toil.I have passed through peril scathless; I was sparedWhen Naples was plague-stricken; I have 'scapedMine enemies' stiletto--fire and flood;I have survived my love, my youth, my self,My thrice-blest Leonora, whom I pitied,Fool that I was! in her void, silent tomb.The God of mercy hath reserved me trulyFor a wise purpose.ANNICCA.         Father, rise; take courage;We know not yet the end.RIBERA.         Why should I riseTo front the level eyes of men's contempt?Oh, I am shamed!  Cover my head, Annicca;Darken mine eyes, and veil my face.  Oh, God,Would that I were a nameless, obscure man,So could I bury with me my disgrace,That now must be immortal.  Where thou standest,Annicca, there she stood last night.  She kissed me;Round mine old neck she wreathed her soft, young arms.My wrinkled cheeks were wet with her warm tears.She shuddered, and I thought it was the thunderStruck terror through her soul.  White-bearded fool!FIAMETTA.I found this scrip upon the chamber-floor,Mayhap it brings some comfort.RIBERA (starts up and snatches the paper she offers him, reads       it rapidly, then to ANNICCA wildly).         Look, look there--'T is writ in blood: "My duty to my lordForbids my telling you our present port."I would track her down with sleuth-hounds, did I notAbhor to see her face.  Ah, press thy handsAgainst my head--my brain is like to burst--My throat is choked.  Help! help![He swoons.]SCENE IV.  A street.  Enter LORENZO and a GENTLEMAN, meeting.  They salute,  and LORENZO is about to pass on.LORENZO.Good-morning, sir.GENTLEMAN.         Hail and farewell so soon,Friend dreamer?  I will lay a goodly sumThe news that flies like fire from tongue to tongueHath not yet warmed thine ear.LORENZO.         What's that?  I layA sum as fair thy news is some dry taleOf courtly gossip, touching me as nighAs the dissensions of the antipodes.GENTLEMAN.Done for a hundred florins!  In the night,'Midst the wild storm whose roar must have invadedEven thy leaden sleep, Prince John left Naples.We should have had a pageant here to-day,A royal exit, floral arches thrownFrom house to house in all the streets he passed,Music and guard of honor, homage fittingThe son of Philip--but the bird has flown.LORENZO.So!  I regret our busy citizens,Who sun themselves day-long upon the quays,Should be deprived of such a festival.Your wager's lost--how am I moved by this?GENTLEMAN.Hark to the end.  'T would move all men whose veinsFlow not clear water.  He hath carried offThe Rose of Naples.LORENZO.         What wouldst thou say?  Speak out!In God's name, who hath followed him?GENTLEMAN.         Ah, thou'rt roused.Thy master hath been robbed--the Spagnoletto--Maria of the Golden Locks--his daughter.LORENZO.How is this known?  'T is a foul slander forgedBy desperate malice.  What! in the night, you say?--She whose bright name was clean as gold, whose heartShone a fixed star of loyal love and dutyBeside her father's glory!  This coarse lieDenies itself.  I will go seek the master,And if this very noon she walk not forth,Led by the Spagnoletto, through the streets,To blind the dazed eyes of her slanderers,--I am your debtor for a hundred florins.GENTLEMAN.Your faith in womanhood becomes you, sir.(Aside.) A beggar's child the mistress of a Prince;Humph! there be some might think the weight of scandalLay on the other side.  (To Lorenzo.) You need not forthTo seek her father.  See, he comes, alone.I will not meddle in the broil.  Farewell![Exit Gentleman.]  Enter RIBERA, without hat or mantle, slowly, with folded arms  and bent head.LORENZO.Oh heart, break not for pity!  Shall he thusUnto all Naples blazon his disgrace?This must not be (advancing).  Father!RIBERA (starts and looks up sharply).         Who calls me father?LORENZO.Why, master, I--you know me not?  Lorenzo.RIBERA.Nor do I care to know thee.  Thou must beAn arrant coward, thus to league with foesAgainst so poor a wretch as I--to call meBy the most curst, despised, unhallowed nameGod's creatures can own.  Away! and let me pass;I injure no man.LORENZO.         Look at me, dear master.Your head is bare, your face is ashy pale,The sun is fierce.  I am your friend, your pupil;Let me but guide my reverend master home,In token of the grateful memoryWherein I hold his guidance of my mindUp the steep paths of art.[While LORENZO speaks, RIBERA slowly gains consciousness of hissituation, raises his hand to his head and shudders violently.LORENZO'S last words seem to awaken him thoroughly.]RIBERA.         I crave your pardonIf I have answered roughly, Sir Lorenzo.My thoughts were far away--I failed to know you--I have had trouble, sir.  You do remind me,I had forgot my hat; that is a trifle,Yet now I feel the loss.  What slaves are weTo circumstance!  One who is wont to coverFor fashion or for warmth his pate, goes forthBareheaded, and the sun will seem to smiteThe shrinking spot, the breeze will make him shiver,And yet our hatless beggars heed them not.We are the fools of habit.  Enter two gentlemen together as promenading; they cross the stage,  looking hard at RIBERA and LORENZO, and exeunt.LORENZO.         Pray you, sirLet me conduct you home.  Here is no placeTo hold discourse.  In God's name, come with me.RIBERA.What coupled staring fools were they that passed?They seemed to scare thee.  Why, boy, face them out.I am the shadow of the Spagnoletto,Else had I brooked no gaze so insolent.Well, I will go with thee.  But, hark thee, lad;A word first in thine ear.  'T is a grim secret;Whisper it not in Naples; I but tell thee,Lest thou should fancy I had lost my wits.My daughter hath deserted me--hath fledFrom Naples with a bastard.  Thou hast seen her,Maria-Rosa--thou must remember her;She, whom I painted as Madonna once.She had fair hair and Spanish eyes.  When was it?I came forth thinking I might meet with herAnd find all this a dream--a foolish thought!I am very weary.  (Yawning.)  I have walked and walkedFor hours.  How far, sir, stand we from the StradaNardo?  I live there, nigh Saint Francis' church.LORENZO.Why, 't is hard by; a stone's throw from this square.So, lean on me--you are not well.  This way.Pluck up good heart, sir; we shall soon be there.[Exeunt.]SCENE V.  Night.  A Room in RIBERA'S House.  ANNICCA seated alone, in an  attitude of extreme weariness and despondency.ANNICCA.His heavy sleep still lasts.  Despite the wordsOf the physician, I can cast not offThat ghastly fear.  Albeit he owned no drugs,This deathlike slumber, this deep breathing slow,His livid pallor makes me dread each momentHis weary pulse will cease.  This is the end,And from the first I knew it.  The worst evilMy warning tongue had wrought were joy to this.No heavier curse could I invoke on herThan that she see him in her dreams, her thoughts,As he is now.  I could no longer bear it;I have fled hither from his couch to breathe--To quicken my spent courage for the end.I cannot pray--my heart is full of curses.He sleeps; he rests.  What better could I wishFor his rent heart, his stunned, unbalanced brain,Than sleep to be eternally prolonged?  Enter FIAMETTA.  ANNICCA looks up anxiously, half rising.ANNICCA.How now?  What news?FIAMETTA.         The master is awakeAnd calls for you, signora.ANNICCA.Heaven be praised![Exit hastily.]FIAMETTA.Would I had followed my young mistress!  HereI creep about like a scared, guilty thing,And fancy at each moment they will guess'T was I who led her to the hut.  I will confess,If any sin there be, to Father Clement,And buy indulgence with her golden chain.'T would burn my throat, the master's rolling eyesWould haunt me ever, if I went to wear it.So, all will yet be well.[Exit.]SCENE VI.  RIBERA'S Room.  RIBERA discovered sitting on the couch. He looks  old and haggard, but has regained his natural bearing and  expression.  Enter ANNICCA.  She hastens towards him, and kneels  beside the couch, kissing him affectionately.ANNICCA.Father, you called me?RIBERA.         Aye, to bid good-night.Why do you kiss me?  To betray to-morrow?ANNICCA.Dear father, you are better; you have slept.Are you not rested?RIBERA.         Child, I was not weary.There was some cloud pressed here (pointing to his forehead) but   that is past,I have no pain nor any sense of ill.Now, while my brain is clear, I have a wordTo speak.  I think not I have been to thee,Nor to that other one, an unkind father.I do not now remember any act,Or any word of mine, could cause thee grief.But I am old--perchance my memoryDeceives in this?  Speak!  Am I right, Annicca?ANNICCA (weeping).Oh, father, father, why will you torture me?You were too good, too good.RIBERA.         Why, so I thought.Since it appears the guerdon of such goodnessIs treachery, abandonment, disgrace,I here renounce my fatherhood.  No childWill I acknowledge mine.  Thou art a wife;Thy duty is thy husband's.  When AntonioReturns from Seville, tell him that his fatherIs long since dead.  Henceforward I will ownNo kin, no home, no tie.  I will away,To-morrow morn, and live an anchorite.One thing ye cannot rob me of--my work.My name shall still outsoar these low, mirk vapors--Not the Ribera, stained with sin and shame,As she hath left it, but the Spagnoletto.My glory is mine own.  I have done with it,But I bequeath it to my country.  NowI will make friends with beasts--they'll prove less savageThan she that was my daughter.  I have spokenFor the last time that word.  Thee I curse not;Thou hast not set thy heel upon my heart;But yet I will not bless thee.  Go.  Good-night.ANNICCA (embracing him).What! will you spurn me thus?  Nay, I will bide,And be to thee all that she should have been,Soothe thy declining years, and heal the woundOf this sharp sorrow.  Thou shalt bless me still,Father--[RIBERA has yielded for a moment to her embrace; but, suddenlyrising, he pushes her roughly from him.]RIBERA.Away!  I know thee.  Thou art oneWith her who duped me with like words last night.Then I believed; but now my sense is closed,My heart is dead as stone.  I cast thee forth.By heaven, I own thee not!  Thou dost forgetI am the Spagnoletto.  Away, I say,Or ere I strike thee.[He threatens her.]ANNICCA.        Woe is me!  Help, help![Exit.]RIBERA.So, the last link is snapt.  Had I not steeledMy heart, I fain had kissed her farewell.'T is better so.  I leave my work unfinished.Could I arise each day to face this spectre,Or sleep with it at night?--to yearn for herEven while I curse her?  No!  The dead remainSacred and sweet in our remembrance still;They seem not to have left us; they abideAnd linger nigh us in the viewless air.The fallen, the guilty, must be rooted outFrom heart and thought and memory.  With themNo hope of blest reunion; they must beAs though they had not been; their spoken nameCuts like a knife.  When I essay to thinkOf what hath passed to-day, my sick brain reels.The letter I remember, but all sinceFloats in a mist of horror, and I graspNo actual form.  Did I not wander forth?A mob surrounded me.  All Naples knewMy downfall, and the street was paved with eyesThat stared into my soul.  Then friendly handsGuided me hither.  When I woke, I feltAs though a stone had rolled from off my brain.But still this nightmare bides the truth.  I knowThey watch me, they suspect me.  I will waitTill the whole household sleep, and then steal forth,Nor unavenged return.ACT V.SCENE I.  A Room in DON TOMMASO'S House.  ANNICCA discovered, attired in  mourning.  Enter DON TOMMASO.DON TOMMASO.If he still live, now shall we hear of him.The news I learn will lure him from his covert,Where'er it lie, to pardon or avenge.ANNICCA (eagerly).What news?  What cheer, Tommaso?DON TOMMASO.         Meagre cheer,But tidings that break through our slow suspense,Like the first thunder-clap in sultry air.Don John sets sail from Sicily, to wedA Princess chosen by the King.  Maria--ANNICCA.Talk not of her--I know her not; her nameWill sear thy tongue.  Think'st thou, in truth this newsWill draw my father from his hiding-place?No--teach me not to hope.  Within my heartA sure voice tells me he is dead.  Not hisThe spirit to drag out a shameful life,To shrink from honest eyes, to sink his browUnto the dust, here where he wore his crown.Thou knowest him.  Have I not cause to mournUncomforted, that he, the first of fathers,Self-murdered--nay, child-murdered--Oh, Tommaso,I would fare barefoot to the ends of the earthTo look again upon his living face,See in his eyes the light of love restored--Not blasting me with lightnings as before--To kneel to him, to solace him, to winFor mine own head, yoked in my sister's curseThe blessing he refused me.DON TOMMASO.         Well, take comfort;This grace may yet be thine.SCENE II.  Palermo.  A Nunnery.  Enter ABBESS, followed by a Lay-Sister.ABBESS.Is the poor creature roused?LAY-SISTER.         Nay, she still sleeps.'T would break your pious heart to see her, mother.She begged our meanest cell, though 't is past doubtShe has been bred to delicate luxury.I deemed her spent, had not the soft breast heavedAs gently as a babe's and even in dreamsTwo crystal drops oozed from her swollen lids,And trickled down her cheeks.  Her grief sleeps not,Although the fragile body craves its rest.ABBESS.Poor child!  I fear she hath sore need of prayer.Hath she yet spoken?LAY-SISTER.         Only such scant wordsOf thanks or answer as our proffered serviceOr questionings demand.  When we are silent,Even if she wake, she seemeth unawareOf any presence.  She will sit and wail,Rocking upon the ground, with dull, wide eyes,Wherefrom the streaming tears unceasing course;The only sound that then escapes her lipsIs, "Father, Father!" in such piteous strainAs though her rent heart bled to utter it.ABBESS.Still she abides then by her first requestTo take the black veil and its vows to-morrow?LAY-SISTER.Yea, to that purpose desperately she clings.This evening, if she rouse, she makes confession.Even now a holy friar waits without,Fra Bruno, of the order of Carthusians,Beyond Palermo.ABBESS.         I will speak with him,Ere he confess her, since we know him not.Follow me, child, and see if she have waked.[Exeunt.]SCENE III.  A Cell in the Nunnery.  MARIA discovered asleep on a straw  pallet.  She starts suddenly from her sleep with a little cry,  half rises and remains seated on her pallet.MARIA.Oh, that wild dream!  My weary bones still acheWith the fierce pain; they wrenched me limb from limb.Thou hadst full cause, my father.  But thou, Juan,What was my sin to thee, save too much love?Oh, would to God my back were crooked with age,My smooth cheek seamed with wrinkles, my bright hairHoary with years, and my quick blood impededBy sluggish torpor, so were I near the endOf woes that seem eternal!  I am strong--Death will not rescue me.  Within my veinsI feel the vigorous pulses of young life,Refusing my release.  My heart at timesRebels against the habit of despair,And, ere I am aware, has wandered back,Among forbidden paths.  What prayer, what penance,Will shrive me clean before the sight of heaven?My hands are black with parricide.  Why elseShould his dead face arise three nights before me,Bleached, ghastly, dripping as of one that's drowned,To freeze my heart with horror?  Christ, have mercy![She covers her face with her hands in an agony of despair.]  Enter a MONK.THE MONK.May peace be in this place![MARIA shudders violently at the sound of his voice; looks up andsees the MONK with bent head, and hands partially extended, as onewho invokes a blessing.  She rises, falls at his feet, and takes thehem of his skirt between her hands, pressing it to he lips.]MARIA.          Welcome, thrice welcome!Bid me not rise, nor bless me with pure hands.Ask not to see my face.  Here let me lie,Kissing the dust--a cast-away, a trait'ress,A murderess, a parricide!MONK.         AccursedWith all Hell's curses is the crime thou nam'st!What devil moved thee?  Who and whence art thou,That wear'st the form of woman, though thou lack'stThe heart of the she-wolf?  Who was thy parent,What fiend of torture, that thine impious handsShould quench the living source of thine own life?MARIA.Spare me! oh, spare me!  Nay, my hands are clean.He was the first, best, noblest among men.I was his light, his soul, his breath of life.These I withdrew from him, and made his daysA darkness.  Yet, perchance he is not dead,And blood and tears may wash away my guilt.Oh, tell me there is hope, though it gleam far--One solitary ray, one steadfast spark,Beyond a million years of purgatory!My burning soul thirsts for the dewy balmOf comfortable grace.  One word, one word,Or ere I perish of despair!MONK.         What word?The one wherewith thou bad'st thy father hope?What though he be not dead?  Is breathing life?Hast thou not murdered him in spirit? dealtThe death-blow to his heart?  Cheat not thy soulWith empty dreams--thy God hath judged ye guilty!MARIA.Have pity, father!  Let me tell thee all.Thou, cloistered, holy and austere, know'st notMy glittering temptations.  My betrayerWas of an angel's aspect.  His were all gifts,All grace, all seeming virtue.  I was plunged,Deaf, dumb, and blind, and hand-bound in the deep.If a poor drowning creature craved thine aid,Thou wouldst not spurn it.  Such a one am I,And all the waves roll over me.  Wrest me from my doom!Say not that I am lost!MONK.         I can but sayWhat the just Spirit prompts.  Myself am naughtTo pardon or condemn.  The sin is sinned;The fruit forbid is tasted, yea, and pressedOf its last honeyed juices. Wilt thou nowEscape the after-bitterness with prayers,Scourgings, and wringings of the hands?  Shall theseUndo what has been done?--make whole the heartThy crime hath snapt in twain?--restore the witsThy sin hath scattered?  No!  Thy punishmentIs huge as thine offence.  Death shall not help,Neither shall pious life wash out the stain.Living thou'rt doomed, and dead, thou shalt be lost,Beyond salvation.MARIA (springing to her feet).         Impious priest, thou liest!God will have mercy--as my father would,Could he but see me in mine agony![The MONK throws back his cowl and discovers himself as theSPAGNOLETTO.  MARIA utters a piercing cry and throws herselfspeechless at his feet.]RIBERA.Thou know'st me not.  I am not what I was.My outward shape remains unchanged; these eyes,Now gloating on thine anguish, are the sameThat wept to see a shadow cross thy brow;These ears, that drink the music of thy groans,Shrank from thy lightest sigh of melancholy.Thou think'st to find the father in me still?Thy parricidal hands have murdered him--Thou shalt not find a man.  I am the spiritOf blind revenge--a brute, unswerving force.What deemest thou hath bound me unto life?Ambition, pleasure, or the sense of fear?What, but the sure hope of this fierce, glad hour,That I might track thee down to this--might seeThy tortured body writhe beneath my feet,And blast thy stricken spirit with my curse?MARIA (in a crushed voice).Have mercy! mercy!RIBERA.         Yes, I will have mercy--The mercy of the tiger or the wolf,Athirst for blood.MARIA (terror-struck, rises upon her knees in an attitude of      supplication.  RIBERA averts his face).         Oh, father, kill me not!Turn not away--I am not changed for thee!In God's name, look at me--thy child, thine own!Spare me, oh, spare me, till I win of HeavenSome sign of promise!  I am lost foreverIf I die now.RIBERA (looks at her in silence, then pushing her from him laughs       bitterly).         Nay, have no fear of me.I would not do thee that much grace to ease theeOf the gross burden of the flesh.  Behold,Thou shalt be cursed with weary length of days;And when thou seek'st to purge thy guilty heart,Thou shalt find there a sin no prayer may shrive--The murder of thy father.  To all dreamsThat haunt thee of past anguish, shall be addedThe vision of this horror![He draws from his girdle a dagger and stabs himself to the heart;he falls and dies, and MARIA flings herself, swooning upon his body.][Portions of this header are copyright (C) 2001 by Michael Hart]This etext was produced by anonymous Project Gutenberg VolunteersThe Project Gutenberg Etext of The Complete Works of Artemus Ward(Charles Farrar Browne) Part 1THE COMPLETE WORKS OF ARTEMUS WARD(CHARLES FARRAR BROWNE)WITH:PRELIMINARY NOTES BY JOHN CAMDEN HOTTEN.A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH BY MELVILLE D.

It is issuedbecause of a demand for a BETTER EDITION than has ever beenpublished.In order to supply this acknowledged want, the publishers haveenlarged and perfected this edition by adding some matter notheretofore published in book form.More than one hundred thousand copies of the work have beenprinted.  The plates had become so worn as to render itunreadable, yet the sale kept on.  In preparing this new edition,many of the author's fragmentary pieces, not contained in the oldedition, have been added.  The earliest of the author's writings,published in periodicals in 1862, are included, together withmany additional illustrations, which now, for the first time,make the work complete.It is universally conceded that no country in the world has everproduced a genius like Artemus Ward.  Writers of ACKNOWLEDGEDGENIUS are never very numerous.  He attained a great and deservedpopularity, which will be lasting.It has been observed that the wit of one generation is rarelyappreciated by the next, but this is not true of Artemus Ward.There is a constant demand for his writings, for the reason thathis jokes require no appendix for their elucidation.  No one whospeaks the English language can fail to appreciate his wonderfulhumor.  It will always be funny.  There is a fascination about itwhich can neither be questioned nor resisted.  His particularniche in the temple of Fame will not be claimed by another.  Hisintellect was sharp and electric.  He saw the humor of anythingat a glance, and his manner of relating these laughter-provokingabsurdities is original and "fetching."PRELIMINARY NOTES BY JOHN CAMDEN HOTTEN.Piccadilly, W.  Jan. 30, 1865.There is a story of two "smart" Yankees, one named Hosea and theother Hezekiah, who met in an oyster shop in Boston.  Said Hosea,"As to opening oysters, why nothing's easier if you only knowhow."  "And how's how?" asked Hezekiah.  "Scotch snuff," repliedHosea, very gravely--"Scotch snuff.  Bring a little of it ever sonear their noses, and they'll sneeze their lids off."  "I know aman who knows a better plan," observed Hezekiah.  "He spreads thebivalves in a circle, seats himself in the centre, reads achapter of Artemus Ward to them, and goes on until they getinterested.  One by one they gape with astonishment at A. Ward'swhoppers, and as they gape my friend whips 'em out, peppers away,and swallows 'em."Excellent as all that Artemus Ward writes really is, andexuberantly overflowing with humour as are nearly all hisarticles, it is too bad to accuse him of telling "whoppers."  Onthe contrary, the old Horatian question of "Who shall forbid meto speak truth in laughter?" seems ever present to his mind.  Hislatest production is the admirable paper "Artemus Ward among theFenians" which appears in Part 7.If Artemus has on any occasion really told "whoppers," it hasbeen in his announcements of being about to visit England.  Fromtime to time he has stated his intention of visiting thiscountry, and from time to time has he disappointed his Englishfriends.He was coming to England after his trip to California, when,laden with gold, he could think of no better place to spend itin.He was on his way to England when he and his companion, Mr.Hingston, encountered the Pi-ute Indians, and narrowly escapedscalping.He was leaving for England with "Betsy Jane" and the "snaiks"before the American war was ended.He had unscrewed the head of each of his "wax figgers," and senteach on board in a carpet-bag, labelled "For England," just as MrLincoln was assassinated.He was hastening to England when the news came a few weeks agothat he had been blown up in an oil well!He has been on his way to England in every newspaper of theAmerican Union for the last two years.Here is the latest announcement:"Artemus Ward, in a private letter, states that Doctor Kumming,the famous London seer and profit, having foretold that the endof the world will happen on his own birthday in January 1867, he,Artemus, will not visit England until the latter end of 1866,when the people there will be selling off, and dollars will beplentiful.  Mr. Ward says that he shall leave England in the laststeamer, in time to see the American eagle spread his wings, andwith the stars and stripes in his beek and tallents, sore away tohis knativ empyrehum.--"  American Paper.But even this is likely to be a "whopper," for a more reliableprivate letter from Artemus declares his fixed purpose to leavefor England in the steamship City of Boston early in June; andthe probabilities are that he will be stepping on English shoresjust about the time that these pages go to press.Lest anything should happen to him, and England be for everdeprived of seeing him, the most recent production of his pen,together with two or three of his best things, are here embalmedfor preservation, on the principle adopted by the affectionatewidow of the bear-trainer of Perpignan.  "I have nothing left,"said the woman; "I am absolutely without a roof to shelter me andthe poor animal."  "Animal!" exclaimed the prefect; "you don'tmean to say that you keep the bear that devoured your husband?""Alas!" she replied, "it is all that is left to me of the poordear man!"If any other excuse be needed for thus presenting the Britishpublic with A. Ward's "last," in addition to the pertinency ofthe article and its real merit, that excuse may be found in thefact that it is thoroughly new to readers on this side of theAtlantic.The general public will undoubtedly receive "Artemus Ward amongthe Fenians" with approving laughter.  Should it fall into thehands of a philo-Fenian the effect may be different.  To him itwould probably have the wrong action of the Yankee bone-pickingmachine."I've got a new machine," said a Yankee pedlar, "for pickingbones out of fish.  Now, I tell you, it's a leetle bit thedarndest thing you ever did see.  All you have to do is to set iton a table and turn a crank, and the fish flies right down yourthroat and the bones right under the grate.  Well, there was acountry greenhorn got hold of it the other day, and he turned thecrank the wrong way; and, I tell you, the way the bones flew downhis throat was awful.  Why, it stuck that fellow so full ofbones, that he could not get his shirt off for a whole week!"In addition to the paper on the Fenians, two other articles byArtemus Ward are reprinted in the present work.  One relates tothe city of Washington, and the other to the author's imaginarytown of Baldinsville.  Both are highly characteristic of thewriter and of his quaint spellings--a heterography not more oddthan that of the postmaster of Shawnee County, Missouri, who,returning his account to the General Office, wrote, "I hearbysertify that the four going A-Counte is as nere Rite as I now howto make It, if there is any mistake it is not Dun a purpers."Artemus Ward has created a new model for funny writers; and thefact is noticeable that, in various parts of this country as wellas in his own, he has numerous puny imitators, who suppose thatby simply adopting his comic spelling they can write quite aswell as he can.  Perhaps it would be as well if they rememberedthe joke of poor Thomas Hood, who said that he could write aswell as Shakespere if he had the mind to, but the trouble was--hehad not got the mind.*   *   *A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH BY MELVILLE D. LANDON.Charles Farrar Browne, better known to the world as "ArtemusWard," was born at Waterford, Oxford County, Maine, on thetwenty-sixth of April, 1834, and died of consumption atSouthampton, England, on Wednesday, the sixth of March, 1867.His father, Levi Browne, was a land surveyor, and Justice of thePeace.  His mother, Caroline E. Brown, is still living, and is adescendant from Puritan stock.Mr. Browne's business manager, Mr. Hingston, once asked him abouthis Puritanic origin, when he replied:  "I think we came fromJerusalem, for my father's name was Levi and we had a Moses and aNathan in the family, but my poor brother's name was Cyrus; so,perhaps, that makes us Persians."Charles was partially educated at the Waterford school, whenfamily circumstances induced his parents to apprentice him tolearn the rudiments of printing in the office of the "SkowheganClarion," published some miles to the north of his nativevillage.  Here he passed through the dreadful ordeal to which aprinter's "devil" is generally subjected.  He always kept histemper; and his eccentric boy jokes are even now told by theresidents of Skowhegan.In the spring, after his fifteenth birthday, Charles Browne badefarewell to the "Skowhegan Clarion;" and we next hear of him inthe office of the "Carpet-Bag," edited by B.P. Shillaber ("Mrs.Partington").  Lean, lank, but strangely appreciative, youngBrowne used to "set up" articles from the pens of Charles G.Halpine ("Miles O'Reilly") and John G. Saxe, the poet.  Here hewrote his first contribution in a disguised hand, slyly put itinto the editorial box, and the next day disguised his pleasurewhile setting it up himself.  The article was a description of aFourth of July celebration in Skowhegan.  The spectacle of theday was a representation of the battle of Yorktown, with G.Washington and General Horace Cornwallis in character.  Thearticle pleased Mr. Shillaber, and Mr. Browne, afterwardsspeaking of it, said:  "I went to the theatre that evening, had agood time of it, and thought I was the greatest man in Boston."While engaged on the "Carpet-Bag," the subject of our sketchclosely studied the theatre and courted the society of actors andactresses.  It was in this way that he gained that correct andvaluable knowledge of the texts and characters of the drama,which enabled him in after years to burlesque them sosuccessfully.  The humorous writings of Seba Smith were hismodels, and the oddities of "John Phoenix" were his especialadmiration.Being of a roving temper Charles Browne soon left Boston, and,after traveling as a journeyman printer over much of New York andMassachusetts, he turned up in the town of Tiffin, Seneca County,Ohio, where he became reporter and compositor at four dollars perweek.  After making many friends among the good citizens ofTiffin, by whom he is remembered as a patron of side shows andtraveling circuses, our hero suddenly set out for Toledo, on thelake, where he immediately made a reputation as a writer ofsarcastic paragraphs in the columns of the Toledo "Commercial."He waged a vigorous newspaper war with the reporters of theToledo "Blade," but while the "Blade" indulged in violentvituperation, "Artemus" was good-natured and full of humor.  Hiscolumn soon gained a local fame and everybody read it.  His fameeven traveled away to Cleveland, where, in 1858, when Mr. Brownewas twenty-four years of age, Mr. J.W. Gray of the Cleveland"Plaindealer" secured him as local reporter, at a salary oftwelve-dollars per week.  Here his reputation first began toassume a national character and it was here that they called hima "fool" when he mentioned the idea of taking the field as alecturer.  Speaking of this circumstance while traveling down theMississippi with the writer, in 1865, Mr. Browne musinglyrepeated this colloquy:WISE MAN:--"Ah! you poor foolish little girl--here is a dollarfor you."FOOLISH LITTLE GIRL:--"Thank you, sir; but I have a sister athome as foolish as I am; can't you give me a dollar for her?"Charles Browne was not successful as a NEWS reporter, lackingenterprise and energy, but his success lay in writing up in aburlesque manner well-known public affairs like prize-fights,races, spiritual meetings, and political gatherings.  Hisdepartment became wonderfully humorous, and was always a favoritewith readers, whether there was any news in it or not.  Sometimeshe would have a whole column of letters from young ladies inreply to a fancied matrimonial advertisement, and then he wouldhave a column of answers to general correspondents like this:--VERITAS:--Many make the same error.  Mr. Key, who wrote the "StarSpangled Banner," is not the author of Hamlet, a tragedy.  Hewrote the banner business, and assisted in "The Female Pirate,"BUT DID NOT WRITE HAMLET.  Hamlet was written by a talented butunscrupulous man named Macbeth, afterwards tried and executed for"murdering sleep."YOUNG CLERGYMAN:--Two pints of rum, two quarts of hot water, tea-cup of sugar, and a lemon; grate in nutmeg, stir thoroughly anddrink while hot.It was during his engagement on the "Plaindealer" that he wrote,dating from Indiana, his first communication,--the firstpublished letter following this sketch, signed "Artemus Ward" asobriquet purely incidental, but borne with the "u" changed to an"a" by an American revolutionary general.  It was here that Mr.Browne first became, IN WORDS, the possessor of a moral show"consisting of three moral bares, the a kangaroo (a amoozinglittle rascal; 'twould make you larf yourself to death to see thelittle kuss jump and squeal), wax figures of G. Washington, &c.&c."  Hundreds of newspapers copied this letter, and CharlesBrowne awoke one morning to find himself famous.In the "Plaindealer" office, his companion, George Hoyt, writes:"His desk was a rickety table which had been whittled and gasheduntil it looked as if it had been the victim of lightning.  Hischair was a fit companion thereto,--a wabbling, unsteady affair,sometimes with four and sometimes with three legs.  But Brownesaw neither the table, nor the chair, nor any person who might benear, nothing, in fact, but the funny pictures which weretumbling out of his brain.  When writing, his gaunt form lookedridiculous enough.  One leg hung over the arm of his chair like agreat hook, while he would write away, sometimes laughing tohimself, and then slapping the table in the excess of his mirth."While in the office of the "Plaindealer," Mr. Browne firstconceived the idea of becoming a lecturer.  In attending thevarious minstrel shows and circuses which came to the city, hewould frequently hear repeated some story of his own which theaudience would receive with hilarity.  His best witticisms cameback to him from the lips of another who made a living by quotinga stolen jest.  Then the thought came to him to enter the lecturefield himself, and become the utterer of his own witticisms--themouthpiece of his own jests.On the 10th of November, 1860, Charles Browne, whose fame,traveling in his letters from Boston to San Francisco, had nowbecome national, grasped the hands of his hundreds of New Yorkadmirers.  Cleveland had throned him the monarch of mirth, and athousand hearts paid him tributes of adulation as he closed hisconnection with the Cleveland Press.Arriving in the Empire City, Mr. Browne soon opened an engagementwith "Vanity Fair," a humorous paper after the manner of London"Punch," and ere long he succeeded Mr. Charles G. Leland aseditor.  Mr. Charles Dawson Shanly says:  "After Artemus Wardbecame sole editor, a position which he held for a brief period,many of his best contributions were given to the public; and,whatever there was of merit in the columns of "Vanity Fair" fromthe time he assumed the editorial charge, emanated from his pen."Mr. Browne himself wrote to a friend:  "Comic copy is what theywanted for "Vanity Fair."  I wrote some and it killed it.  Thepoor paper got to be a conundrum, and so I gave it up."The idea of entering the field as a lecturer now seized Mr.Browne stronger than ever.  Tired of the pen, he resolved ontrying the platform.  His Bohemian friends agreed that his fameand fortune would be made before intelligent audiences.  Heresolved to try it.  What should be the subject of my lecture?How shall I treat the subject?  These questions caused Mr. Brownegrave speculations.  Among other schemes, he thought of a stringof jests combined with a stream of satire, the whole beingunconnected--a burlesque upon a lecture.  The subject,--that wasa hard question.  First he thought of calling it "My SevenGrandmothers," but he finally adopted the name of "Babes in theWoods," and with this subject Charles Browne was introduced to ametropolitan audience, on the evening of December 23d, 1861.  Theplace was Clinton Hall, which stood on the site of the old AstorPlace Opera House, where years ago occurred the Macready riot,and where now is the Mercantile Library.  Previous to thisintroduction, Mr. Frank Wood accompanied him to the suburban townof Norwich, Connecticut, where he first delivered his lecture,and watched the result.  The audience was delighted, and Mr.Browne received an ovation.  Previous to his Clinton Hallappearance the city was flooded with funny placards reading--                      ARTEMUS WARD                          WILL                      SPEAK A PIECE.Owing to a great storm, only a small audience braved theelements, and the Clinton Hall lecture was not a financialsuccess.  It consisted of a wandering batch of comicalities,touching upon everything except "The Babes."  Indeed it wasbetter described by the lecturer in London, when he said, "One ofthe features of my entertainment is, that it contains so manythings that don't have anything to do with it."In the middle of his lecture, the speaker would hesitate, stop,and say:  "Owing to a slight indisposition we will now have anintermission of fifteen minutes."  The audience looked in utterdismay at the idea of staring at vacancy for a quarter of anhour, when, rubbing his hands, the lecturer would continue:"but, ah--during the intermission I will go on with my lecture!"Mr. Browne's first volume, entitled "Artemus Ward; His Book," waspublished in New York, May 17th, 1862.  The volume was everywherehailed with enthusiasm, and over forty thousand copies were sold.Great success also attended the sale of his three other volumespublished in '65, '67, and '69.Mr. Browne's next lecture was entitled "Sixty Minutes in Africa,"and was delivered in Musical Fund Hall, Philadelphia.  Behind himhung a large map of Africa, "which region," said Artemus,"abounds in various natural productions, such as reptiles andflowers.  It produces the red rose, the white rose, and the neg-roes.  In the middle of the continent is what is called a'howling wilderness,' but, for my part, I have never heard ithowl, nor met with any one who has."After Mr. Browne had created immense enthusiasm for his lecturesand books in the Eastern States, which filled his pockets with ahandsome exchequer, he started, October 3d, 1863, for California,a faithful account of which trip is given by himself in thisbook.  Previous to starting, he received a telegram from ThomasMaguire, of the San Francisco Opera House, inquiring "what hewould TAKE FOR FORTY NIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA."  Mr. Brownimmediately telegraphed back,--                   "Brandy and water.                              A. Ward."And, though Maguire was sorely puzzled at the contents of thedispatch, the Press got hold of it, and it went throughCalifornia as a capital joke.Mr. Browne first lectured in San Francisco on "The Babes in theWoods," November 13th, 1863, at Pratt's Hall.  T. Starr King tooka deep interest in him, occupying the rostrum, and his generalreception in San Francisco was warm.Returning overland, through Salt Lake to the States, in the fallof 1864, Mr. Browne lectured again in New York, this time on the"Mormons," to immense audiences, and in the spring of 1865 hecommenced his tour through the country, everywhere drawingenthusiastic audiences both North and South.It was while on this tour that the writer of this sketch againspent some time with him.  We met at Memphis and traveled downthe Mississippi together.  At Lake Providence the "Indiana"rounded up to our landing, and Mr. Browne accompanied the writerto his plantation, where he spent several days, mingling inseeming infinite delight with the negroes.  For them he showedgreat fondness, and they used to stand around him in crowdslistening to his seemingly serious advice.  We could not prevailupon him to hunt or to join in any of the equestrian amusementswith the neighboring planters, but a quiet fascination drew himto the negroes.  Strolling through the "quarters," his gravewords, too deep with humor for darkey comprehension, gainedtheir entire confidence.  One day he called up Uncle Jeff., anUncle-Tom-like patriarch, and commenced in his usual vein:  "Now,Uncle Jefferson," he said, "why do you thus pursue the habits ofindustry?  This course of life is wrong--all wrong--all a basehabit, Uncle Jefferson.  Now try to break it off.  Look at me,--look at Mr. Landon, the chivalric young Southern plantist FROMNEW YORK, he toils not, neither does he spin; he pursues a careerof contented idleness.  If you only thought so, Jefferson, youcould live for months WITHOUT PERFORMING ANY KIND OF LABOR, andat the expiration of that time FEEL FRESH AND VIGOROUS ENOUGH TOCOMMENCE IT AGAIN.  Idleness refreshes the physical organization--IT IS A SWEET BOON!  Strike at the roots of the destroying habitto-day, Jefferson.  It tires you out; resolve to be idle; no oneshould labor; HE SHOULD HIRE OTHERS TO DO IT FOR HIM;" and thenhe would fix his mournful eyes on Jeff. and hand him a dollar,while the eyes of the wonder-struck darkey would gaze in muteadmiration upon the good and wise originator of the only theorywhich the darkey mind could appreciate.  As Jeff. went away totell the wonderful story to his companions, and backed it withthe dollar as material proof, Artemus would cover his eyes, andbend forward on his elbows in a chuckling laugh."Among the Mormons" was delivered through the States, everywheredrawing immense crowds.  His manner of delivering his discoursewas grotesque and comical beyond description.  His quaint and sadstyle contributed more than anything else to render hisentertainment exquisitely funny.  The programme was exceedinglydroll, and the tickets of admission presented the most ludicrousof ideas.  The writer presents a fac-simile of an admissionticket which was presented to him in Natchez by Mr. Browne:--                   ADMIT THE BEARER                     AND ONE WIFE.                           YOURS TROOLY,                                 A. WARD.In the spring of 1866, Charles Browne first timidly thought ofgoing to Europe.  Turning to Mr. Hingston one day he asked:"What sort of a man is Albert Smith?  Do you think the Mormonswould be as good a subject to the Londoners as Mont Blanc was?"Then he said:  "I should like to go to London and give my lecturein the same place.  Can't it be done?"Mr. Browne sailed for England soon after, taking with him hisPanorama.  The success that awaited him could scarcely have beenanticipated by his most intimate friends.  Scholars, wits, poets,and novelists came to him with extended hands, and his stay inLondon was one ovation to the genius of American wit.  CharlesReade, the novelist, was his warm friend and enthusiasticadmirer; and Mr. Andrew Haliday introduced him to the "LiteraryClub," where he became a great favorite.  Mark Lemon came to himand asked him to become a contributor to "Punch," which he did.His "Punch" letters were more remarked in literary circles thanany other current matter.  There was hardly a club-meeting or adinner at which they were not discussed.  "There was something sogrotesque in the idea," said a correspondent, "of this ruthlessYankee poking among the revered antiquities of Britain, that thebeef-eating British themselves could not restrain their laughter."The story of his Uncle William who "followed commercial pursuits,glorious commerce--and sold soap," and his letters on the Towerand "Chowser," were palpable hits, and it was admitted that"Punch" had contained nothing better since the days of"Yellowplush."  This opinion was shared by the "Times," theliterary reviews, and the gayest leaders of society.  Thepublishers of "Punch" posted up his name in large letters overtheir shop in Fleet Street, and Artemus delighted to point it outto his friends.  About this time Mr. Browne wrote to his friendJack Rider, of Cleveland:"This is the proudest moment of my life.  To have been as wellappreciated here as at home; to have written for the oldest comicJournal in the English language, received mention with Hood, withJerrold and Hook, and to have my picture and my pseudonym ascommon in London as in New York, is enough for                                         "Yours truly,                                                "A. Ward."England was thoroughly aroused to the merits of Artemus Ward,before he commenced his lectures at Egyptian Hall, and when, inNovember, he finally appeared, immense crowds were compelled toturn away.  At every lecture his fame increased, and whensickness brought his brilliant success to an end, a nationmourned his retirement.On the evening of Friday, the seventh week of his engagement atEgyptian Hall, Artemus became seriously ill, an apology was madeto a disappointed audience, and from that time the light of oneof the greatest wits of the centuries commenced fading intodarkness.  The Press mourned his retirement, and a funeral pallfell over London.  The laughing, applauding crowds were soon tosee his consumptive form moving towards its narrow resting-placein the cemetery at Kensal Green.By medical advice Charles Browne went for a short time to theIsland of Jersey--but the breezes of Jersey were powerless.  Hewrote to London to his nearest and dearest friends--the membersof a literary club of which he was a member--to complain that his"loneliness weighed on him."  He was brought back, but could notsustain the journey farther than Southampton.  There the membersof the club traveled from London to see him--two at a time--thathe might be less lonely.His remains were followed to the grave from the rooms of hisfriend Arthur Sketchley, by a large number of friends andadmirers, the literati and press of London paying the lasttribute of respect to their dead brother.  The funeral serviceswere conducted by the Rev. M.D. Conway, formerly of Cincinnati,and the coffin was temporarily placed in a vault, from which itwas removed by his American friends, and his body now sleeps bythe side of his father, Levi Browne, in the quiet cemetery atWaterford, Maine.  Upon the coffin is the simple inscription:--                    "CHARLES F. BROWNE,                      AGED 32 YEARS,          Better Known to the World as 'Artemus Ward.'"His English executors were T.W. Robertson, the playwright, andhis friend and companion, E.P. Hingston.  His literary executorswere Horace Greeley and Richard H. Stoddard.  In his will, hebequeathed among other things a large sum of money to his littlevalet, a bright little fellow; though subsequent denoumentsrevealed the fact that he left only a six-thousand-dollar housein Yonkers.  There is still some mystery about his finances,which may one day be revealed.  It is known that he withdrew10,000 dollars from the Pacific Bank to deposit it with a friendbefore going to England; besides this, his London "Punch" letterspaid a handsome profit.  Among his personal friends were GeorgeHoyt, the late Daniel Setchell, Charles W.  Coe, and Mr. Mullen,the artist, all of whom he used to style "my friends all the yearround."Personally Charles Farrar Browne was one of the kindest and mostaffectionate of men, and history does not name a man who was souniversally beloved by all who knew him.  It was remarked, andtruly, that the death of no literary character since WashingtonIrving caused such general and widespread regret.In stature he was tall and slender.  His nose was prominent,--outlined like that of Sir Charles Napier, or Mr. Seward; his eyesbrilliant, small, and close together; his mouth large, teethwhite and pearly; fingers long and slender; hair soft, straight,and blonde; complexion florid; mustache large, and his voice softand clear.  In bearing, he moved like a natural-born gentleman.In his lectures he never smiled--not even while he was givingutterance to the most delicious absurdities; but all the whilethe jokes fell from his lips as if he was unconscious of theirmeaning.  While writing his lectures, he would laugh and chuckleto himself continually.There was one peculiarity about Charles Browne--HE NEVER MADE ANENEMY.  Other wits in other times have been famous, but asatirical thrust now and then has killed a friend.  Diogenes wasthe wit of Greece, but when, after holding up an old dried fishto draw away the eyes of Anaximenes' audience, he exclaimed "Seehow an old fish is more interesting than Anaximenes," he said afunny thing, but he stabbed a friend.  When Charles Lamb, inanswer to the doting mother's question as to how he liked babies,replied, "b-b-boiled, madam, BOILED!" that mother loved him nomore:  and when John Randolph said "THANK YOU!" to hisconstituent who kindly remarked that he had the pleasure ofPASSING his house, it was wit at the expense of friendship.  Thewhole English school of wits--with Douglas Jerrold, Hood,Sheridan, and Sidney Smith, indulged in repartee.  They werePARASITIC wits.  And so with the Irish, except that an Irishmanis generally so ridiculously absurd in his replies as to onlyexcite ridicule.  "Artemus Ward" made you laugh and love him too.The wit of "Artemus Ward" and "Josh Billings" is distinctivelyAmerican.  Lord Kames, in his "Elements of Criticism," makes nomention of this species of wit, a lack which the futurerhetorician should look to.  We look in vain for it in theEnglish language of past ages, and in other languages of moderntime.  It is the genus American.  When Artemus says in thatserious manner, looking admiringly at his atrocious pictures,--"Ilove pictures--and I have many of them--beautiful photographs--ofmyself;" you smile; and when he continues, "These pictures werepainted by the Old Masters; they painted these pictures and thenthey--they expired;" you hardly know what it is that makes youlaugh outright; and when Josh Billings says in his Proverbs,wiser than Solomon's "You'd better not know so much, than know somany things that ain't so;"--the same vein is struck, but thetext-books fail to explain scientifically the cause of our mirth.The wit of Charles Browne is of the most exalted kind.  It isonly scholars and those thoroughly acquainted with the SUBTILTYof our language who fully appreciate it.  His wit is generallyabout historical personages like Cromwell, Garrick, orShakspeare, or a burlesque on different styles of writing, likehis French novel, when hifalutin phrases of tragedy come from theclodhopper who--"sells soap and thrice--refuses a ducal coronet."Mr. Browne mingled the eccentric even in his business letters.Once he wrote to his Publisher, Mr. G.W. Carleton, who had madesome alterations in his MSS.:  "The next book I write I'm goingto get YOU to write."  Again he wrote in 1863:"Dear Carl:--You and I will get out a book next spring, whichwill knock spots out of all comic books in ancient or modernhistory.  And the fact that you are going to take hold of itconvinces me that you have one of the most MASSIVE intellects ofthis or any other epoch."Yours, my pretty gazelle,"A. Ward."When Charles F. Browne died, he did not belong to America, for,as with Irving and Dickens, the English language claimed him.Greece alone did not suffer when the current of Diogenes' witflowed on to death.  Spain alone did not mourn when Cervantes,dying, left Don Quixote, the "knight of la Mancha."  When CharlesLamb ceased to tune the great heart of humanity to joy andgladness, his funeral was in every English and American household; and when Charles Browne took up his silent resting-place in thesombre shades of Kensal Green, JESTING CEASED, and one greatAnglo-American heart,             Like a muffled drum went beating               Funeral marches to his grave.                                  MELVILLE D. LANDON.INTRODUCTION  BY T.W. ROBERTSON.Few tasks are more difficult or delicate than to write on thesubject of the works or character of a departed friend.  The penfalters as the familiar face looks out of the paper.  The mind isdiverted from the thought of death as the memory recalls some happyepigram.  It seems so strange that the hand that traced the jokesshould be cold, that the tongue that trolled out the good thingsshould be silent--that the jokes and the good things should remain,and the man who made them should be gone for ever.The works of Charles Farrar Browne--who was known to the world as"Artemus Ward"--have run through so many editions, have met withsuch universal popularity, and have been so widely criticised, thatit is needless to mention them here.  So many biographies have beenwritten of the gentleman who wrote in the character of the 'cuteYankee Showman, that it is unnecessary that I should touch upon hislife, belongings, or adventures.  Of "Artemus Ward" I know just asmuch as the rest of the world.  I prefer, therefore, to speak ofCharles Farrar Browne, as I knew him, and, in doing so, I canpromise those friends who also knew him and esteemed him, that as Iconsider no "public" man so public, that some portion of his work,pleasures, occupations, and habits may not be considered private, Ishall only mention how kind and noble-minded was the man of whom Iwrite, without dragging forward special and particular acts in proofof my words, as if the goodness of his mind and character needed thecertificate of facts.I first saw Charles Browne at a literary club; he had only been afew hours in London, and he seemed highly pleased and excited atfinding himself in the old city to which his thoughts had so oftenwandered.  Browne was an intensely sympathetic man.  His brain andfeelings were as a "lens," and he received impressions immediately.No man could see him without liking him at once.  His manner wasstraightforward and genial, and had in it the dignity of agentleman, tempered, as it were, by the fun of the humorist.  Whenyou heard him talk you wanted to make much of him, not because hewas "Artemus Ward," but because he was himself, for no one lessresembled "Artemus Ward" than his author and creator, Charles FarrarBrowne.  But a few weeks ago it was remarked to me that authors werea disappointing race to know, and I agreed with the remark, and Iremember a lady once said to me that the personal appearance ofpoets seldom "came up" to their works.  To this I replied that,after all, poets were but men, and that it was as unreasonable toexpect that the late Sir Walter Scott could at all resemble aGathering of the Clans as that the late Lord Macaulay should appearanything like the Committal of the Seven Bishops to the Tower.  Itold the lady that she was unfair to eminent men if she hoped thatcelebrated engineers would look like tubular bridges, or that SirEdwin Landseer would remind her of a "Midsummer Night's Dream."  Imention this because, of all men in the world, my friend CharlesBrowne was the least like a showman of any man I ever encountered.I can remember the odd half disappointed look of some of thevisitors to the Egyptian Hall when "Artemus" stepped upon theplatform.  At first they thought that he was a gentleman whoappeared to apologise for the absence of the showman.  They hadpictured to themselves a coarse old man, with a damp eye and apuckered mouth, one eyebrow elevated an inch above the other toexpress shrewdness and knowledge of the world--a man clad invelveteen and braid, with a heavy watch-chain, large rings, andhorny hands, the touter to a waxwork show, with a hoarse voice, andover familiar manner.  The slim gentleman in evening dress, polishedmanners, and gentle voice, with a tone of good breeding that hoveredbetween deference and jocosity; the owner of those thin--those muchtoo thin--white hands could not be the man who spelt joke with a"g."  Folks who came to laugh, began to fear that they should remainto be instructed, until the gentlemanly disappointer began to speak,then they recovered their real "Artemus," Betsy Jane, wax-figgers,and all.  Will patriotic Americans forgive me if I say that CharlesBrowne loved England dearly!  He had been in London but a few dayswhen he paid a visit to the Tower.  He knew English history betterthan most Englishmen; and the Tower of London was to him the historyof England embalmed in stone and mortar.  No man had more reverencein his nature; and at the Tower he saw that what he had read wasreal.  There were the beef-eaters; there had been Queen Elizabethand Sir Walter Raleigh, and Lady Jane Grey, and Shakspere's murderedprinces, and their brave, cruel uncle.  There was the block and theaxe, and the armour and the jewels.  "St George for Merrie England!"had been shouted in the Holy Land, and men of the same blood ashimself had been led against the infidel by men of the same brainand muscle as George Washington.  Robin Hood was a reality, and nota schoolboy's myth like Ali Baba and Valentine and Orson.There were two sets of feelings in Charles Browne at the Tower.  Hecould appreciate the sublimity of history, but, as the "Show" partof the exhibition was described to him, the humorist, the wit, andthe iconoclast from the other side the Atlantic must have smiled atthe "descriptions."  The "Tower" was a "show," like his own--ArtemusWard's.  A price was paid for admission, and the "figgers" were"orated."  Real jewellery is very like sham jewellery after all, andthe "Artemus" vein in Charles Browne's mental constitution--the veinof humour, whose source was a strong contempt of all things false,mean, shabby, pretentious, and only external--of bunkum andBarnumisation--must have seen a gigantic speculation realisingshiploads of dollars if the Tower could have been taken over to theStates, and exhibited from town to town--the Stars and Stripes flyingover it--with a four-horse lecture to describe the barbarity of theancient British Barons and the cuss of chivalry.Artemus Ward's Lecture on the Mormons at the Egyptian Hall,Piccadilly, was a great success.  His humour was so entirely fresh,new, and unconventional, it took his hearers by surprise, andcharmed them.  His failing health compelled him to abandon thelecture after about eight or ten weeks.  Indeed, during that briefperiod he was once or twice compelled to dismiss his audience.  Ihave myself seen him sink into a chair and nearly faint after theexertion of dressing.  He exhibited the greatest anxiety to be athis post at the appointed time, and scrupulously exerted himself tothe utmost to entertain his auditors.  It was not because he wassick that the public was to be disappointed, or that their enjoymentwas to be diminished.  During the last few weeks of hislecture-giving he steadily abstained from accepting any of thenumerous invitations he received.  Had he lived through thefollowing London fashionable season, there is little doubt that theroom at the Egyptian Hall would have been thronged nightly.  Ouraristocracy have a fine delicate sense of humour, and the success,artistic and pecuniary, of "Artemus Ward" would have rivalled thatof the famous "Lord Dundreary."  There are many stupid people whodid not understand the "fun" of Artemus Ward's books.  In theirvernacular "they didn't see it."  There were many stupid people whodid not understand the fun of Artemus Ward's lecture on the Mormons.They could not see it.  Highly respectable people--the pride oftheir parish, when they heard of a lecture "upon the Mormons"--expected to see a solemn person, full of old saws and newstatistics, who would denounce the sin of polygamy, and bray againstpolygamists with four-and-twenty boiling-water Baptist power ofdenunciation.  These uncomfortable Christians do not like humour.They dread it as a certain personage is said to dread holy water,and for the same reason that thieves fear policemen--it finds themout.  When these good idiots heard Artemus offer, if they did notlike the lecture in Piccadilly, to give them free tickets for thesame lecture in California, when he next visited that country, theyturned to each other indignantly, and said "What use are tickets forCalifornia to us?  We are not going to California.  No! we are toogood, too respectable, to go so far from home.  The man is a fool!"One of these ornaments of the vestry complained to the doorkeepers,and denounced the lecture as an imposition; "and," said the wealthyparishioner, "as for the panorama, it's the worst painted thing Iever saw in all my life!"But the entertainment, original, humorous, and racy though it was,was drawing to a close!  In the fight between youth and death, deathwas to conquer.  By medical advice Charles Browne went for a shorttime to Jersey--but the breezes of Jersey were powerless.  He wroteto London to his nearest and dearest friends--the members of aliterary club of which he was a member--to complain that his"loneliness weighed on him."  He was brought back, but could notsustain the journey farther than Southampton.  There the members ofthe beforementioned club travelled from London to see him--two at atime--that he might be less lonely--and for the unwearyingsolicitude of his friend and agent, Mr. Hingston, and to the kindlysympathy of the United States Consul at Southampton, CharlesBrowne's best and dearest friends had cause to be grateful.  Icannot close these lines without mention of "Artemus Ward's" lastjoke.  He had read in the newspapers that a wealthy American hadoffered to present the Prince of Wales with a splendid yacht,American built."It seems," said the invalid, "a fashion now-a-days for everybody topresent the Prince of Wales with something.  I think I shall leavehim--my panorama!"Charles Browne died beloved and regretted by all who knew him, andby many who had known him but a few weeks; and when he drew his lastbreath, there passed away the Spirit of a true gentleman.                                           T.W. ROBERTSONLondon, August 11, 1868.PREFATORY NOTE                   BY EDWARD P. HINGSTON.In Cleveland, Ohio, the pleasant city beside the lakes, Artemus Wardfirst determined to become a public lecturer.  He and I rambledthrough Cleveland together after his return from California.  Hecalled on some old friends at the Herald office, then went over tothe Weddel House, and afterwards strolled across to the offices ofthe "Plain Dealer", where, in his position as sub-editor, he hadwritten many of his earlier essays.  Artemus inquired for Mr. Gray,the editor, who chanced to be absent.  Looking round at the vacantdesks and inkstained furniture, Artemus was silent for a minute ortwo, and then burst into one of those peculiar chuckling fits oflaughter in which he would occasionally indulge; not a loud laugh,but a shaking of the whole body with an impulse of merriment whichset every muscle in motion.  "Here," said he, "here's where theycalled me a fool."  The remembrance of their so calling him seemedto afford him intense amusement.>From the office of the Cleveland Plain Dealer we continued our tourof the town.  Presently we found ourselves in front of Perry'sstatue, the monument erected to commemorate the naval engagement onLake Erie, wherein the Americans came off victorious.  Artemuslooked up to the statue, laid his finger to the side of his nose,and, in his quaint manner, remarked, "I wonder whether they calledhim 'a fool' too, when he went to fight!"The remark, following close as it did upon his laughing fit in thenewspaper office, caused me to inquire why he had been called "afool," and who had called him so."It was the opinion of my friends on the paper," he replied.  "Itold them that I was going in for lecturing.  They laughed at me,and called me `a fool.'  Don't you think they were right?"Then we sauntered up Euclid Street, under the shade of its avenue oftrees.  As we went along, Artemus Ward recounted to me the story ofhis becoming a lecturer.  Our conversation on that agreeable eveningis fresh in my remembrance.  Memory still listens to the voice of mycompanion in the stroll, still sees the green trees of Euclid Streetcasting their shadows across our path, and still joins in the laughwith Artemus, who, having just returned from California, where hehad taken sixteen hundred dollars at one lecture, did not think thatto be evidence of his having lost his senses.The substance of that which Artemus Ward then told me was, thatwhile writing for the "Cleveland Plain Dealer" he was accustomed, inthe discharge of his duties as a reporter, to attend theperformances of the various minstrel troups and circuses whichvisited the neighbourhood.  At one of these he would hear some storyof his own, written a month or two previously, given by the"middle-man" of the minstrels and received with hilarity by theaudience.  At another place he would be entertained by listening tojokes of his own invention, coarsely retailed by the clown of thering, and shouted at by the public as capital waggery on the part ofthe performer.  His own good things from the lips of another "cameback to him with alienated majesty," as Emerson expresses it.  Thenthe thought would steal over him--Why should that man gain a livingwith my witticisms, and I not use them in the same way myself? whynot be the utterer of my own coinage, the quoter of my own jests,the mouthpiece of my own merry conceits?  Certainly, it was not avery exalted ambition to aim at the glories of a circus clown or thetriumphs of a minstrel with a blackened face.  But, in the UnitedStates a somewhat different view is taken of that which is fittingand seemly for a man to do, compared with the estimate we form inthis country.  In a land where the theory of caste is not admitted,the relative respectability of the various professions is not quitethe same as it is with us.  There the profession does not disqualifyif the man himself be right, nor the claim to the title of gentlemandepend upon the avocation followed.  I know of one or two clowns inthe ring who are educated physicians, and not thought to be any theless gentlemen because they propound conundrums and perpetrate jestsinstead of prescribing pills and potions.Artemus Ward was always very self-reliant; when once he believedhimself to be in the right it was almost impossible to persuade himto the contrary.  But, at the same time, he was cautious in theextreme, and would well consider his position before deciding thatwhich was right or wrong for him to do.  The idea of becoming apublic man having taken possession of his mind, the next point todecide was in what form he should appear before the public.  That ofa humorous lecturer seemed to him to be the best.  It was unoccupiedground.  America had produced entertainers who by means of facialchanges or eccentricities of costume had contrived to amuse theiraudiences, but there was no one who ventured to joke for an hourbefore a house full of people with no aid from scenery or dress.The experiment was one which Artemus resolved to try.  Accordingly,he set himself to work to collect all his best quips and cranks, toinvent what new drolleries he could, and to remember all the goodthings that he had heard or met with.  These he noted down andstrung together almost without relevancy or connexion.  Themanuscript chanced to fall into the hands of the people at theoffice of the newspaper on which he was then employed, and thequestion was put to him of what use he was going to make of thestrange jumble of jest which he had thus compiled.  His answer wasthat he was about to turn lecturer, and that before them were thematerials of his lecture.  It was then that his friends laughed athim, and characterised him as "a fool.""They had some right to think so," said Artemus to me as we rambledup Euclid Street.  "I half thought that I was one myself.  I don'tlook like a lecturer--do I?"He was always fond, poor fellow, of joking on the subject of hispersonal appearance.  His spare figure and tall stature, hisprominent nose and his light-colored hair, were each made thesubject of a joke at one time or another in the course of hislecturing career.  If he laughed largely at the foibles of others,he was equally disposed to laugh at any shortcomings he could detectin himself.  If anything at all in his outward form was to him asource of vanity, it was the delicate formation of his hands.White, soft, long, slender, and really handsome, they were more likethe hands of a high-born lady than those of a Western editor.  Heattended to them with careful pride, and never alluded to them as asubject for his jokes, until, in his last illness, they had becomeunnaturally fair, translucent, and attenuated.  Then it was that afriend calling upon him at his apartments in Piccadilly, endeavouredto cheer him at a time of great mental depression, and pleasantlyreminded him of a ride they had long ago projected through theSouth-Western States of the Union.  "We must do that ride yet,Artemus.  Short stages at first, and longer ones as we go on."  PoorArtemus lifted up his pale, slender hands, and letting the lightshine through them, said jocosely, "Do you think these would do tohold a rein with?   Why, the horse would laugh at them."Having collected a sufficient number of quaint thoughts, whimsicalfancies, bizarre notions, and ludicrous anecdotes, the difficultywhich then, according to his own confession, occurred to ArtemusWard was, what should be the title of his lecture.  The subject wasno difficulty at all, for the simple reason that there was not to beany.  The idea of instructing or informing his audience never onceentered into his plans.  His intention was merely to amuse; ifpossible, keep the house in continuous laughter for an hour and ahalf, or rather an hour and twenty minutes, for that was the precisetime, in his belief, which people could sit to listen and to laughwithout becoming bored; and, if possible, send his audience homewell pleased with the lecturer and with themselves, without theirhaving any clear idea of that which they had been listening to, andnot one jot the wiser than when they came.  No one better understoodthan Artemus the wants of a miscellaneous audience who paid theirdollar or half-dollar each to be amused.  No one could gauge betterthan he the capacity of the crowd to feed on pure fun, and no onecould discriminate more clearly than he the fitness, temper, andmental appetite of the constituents of his evening assemblies.  Theprosiness of an ordinary Mechanics' Institute lecture was to himsimply abhorrent; the learned platitudes of a professed lecturerwere to him, to use one of his own phrases, "worse than poison."  Tomake people laugh was to be his primary endeavour.  If in so makingthem laugh he could also cause them to see through a sham, beashamed of some silly national prejudice, or suspicious of the valueof some current piece of political bunkum, so much the better.  Hebelieved in laughter as thoroughly wholesome; he had the firmestconviction that fun is healthy, and sportiveness the truest sign ofsanity.  Like Talleyrand, he was of opinion that "Qui vit sans jolien'est pas si sage qu'il croit."Artemus Ward's first lecture was entitled "The Babes in the Wood."I asked him why he chose that title, because there was nothingwhatever in the lecture relevant to the subject of the child-booklegend.  He replied, "It seemed to sound the best.  I once thoughtof calling the lecture 'My Seven Grandmothers.'  Don't you thinkthat would have been good?"  It would at any rate have been just aspertinent.Incongruity as an element of fun was always an idea uppermost in themind of the Western humorist.  I am not aware that the notes of anyof his lectures, except those of his Mormon experience, have beenpreserved, and I have some doubts if any one of his lectures, exceptthe Mormon one, was ever fairly written out.  "The Babes in theWood," as a lecture, was a pure and unmitigated "sell."  It wasmerely joke after joke, and drollery succeeding to drollery, withoutany connecting thread whatever.  It was an exhibition of fireworks,owing half its brilliancy and more than half its effect to the skillof the man who grouped the fireworks together and let them off.  Inthe hands of any other pyrotechnist the squibs would have failed tolight, the rockets would have refused to ascend, and the"nine-bangers" would have exploded but once or twice only, insteadof nine times.  The artist of the display being no more, and thefireworks themselves having gone out, it is perhaps not to beregretted that the cases of the squibs and the tubes of the rocketshave not been carefully kept.  Most of the good things introduced byArtemus Ward in his first lecture were afterwards incorporated byhim in subsequent writings, or used over again in his laterentertainment.  Many of them had reference to the events of the day,the circumstances of the American War and the politics of the GreatRebellion.  These, of course, have lost their interest with thepassing away of the times which gave them birth.  The points of manyof the jokes have corroded, and the barbed head of many an arrow ofArtemus's wit has rusted into bluntness with the decay of the bowfrom which it was propelled.If I remember rightly, the "Babes in the Wood" were never mentionedmore than twice in the whole lecture.  First, when the lecturer toldhis audience that the "Babes" were to constitute the subject of hisdiscourse, and then digressed immediately to matters quite foreignto the story.  Then again at the conclusion of the hour and twentyminutes of drollery, when he finished up in this way: "I now come tomy subject 'The Babes in the Wood.'"  Here he would take out hiswatch, look at it with affected surprise, put on an appearance ofbeing greatly perplexed, and amidst roars of laughter from thepeople, very gravely continue, "But I find that I have exceeded mytime, and will therefore merely remark that, so far as I know, theywere very good babes--they were as good as ordinary babes.  I reallyhave not time to go into their history.  You will find it all in thestory-books.  They died in the woods, listening to the woodpeckertapping the hollow beech-tree.  It was a sad fate for them, and Ipity them.  So, I hope, do you.  Good night!"Artemus gave his first lecture at Norwich in Connecticut, andtravelled over a considerable portion of the Eastern States beforehe ventured to give a sample of his droll oratory in the Westerncities, wherein he had earned reputation as a journalist.  Graduallyhis popularity became very great, and in place of letting himselfout at so much per night to literary societies and athenaeums, heconstituted himself his own showman, engaging that indispensableadjunct to all showmen in the United States, an agent to go ahead,engage halls, arrange for the sale of tickets, and engineer thesuccess of the show.  Newspapers had carried his name to everyvillage of the Union, and his writings had been largely quoted inevery journal.  It required, therefore, comparatively littleadvertising to announce his visit to any place in which he had tolecture.  But it was necessary that he should have a bill or posterof some kind.  The one he adopted was simple, quaint, striking, andwell adapted to the purpose.  It was merely one large sheet, with ablack ground, and the letters cut out in the block, so as to printwhite.  The reading was "Artemus Ward will Speak a Piece."  To theAmerican mind this was intensely funny from its childish absurdity.It is customary in the States for children to speak or recite "apiece" at school at the annual examination, and the phrase is usedjust in the same sense as in England we say "a Christmas piece."The professed subject of the lecture being that of a story familiarto children, harmonised well with the droll placard which announcedits delivery.  The place and time were notified on a slip pastedbeneath.  To emerge from the dull depths of lyceum committees andlaunch out as a showman-lecturer on his own responsibility, wassomething both novel and bold for Artemus to do.  In the majority ofinstances he or his agent met with speculators who were ready toengage him for so many lectures, and secure to the lecturer acertain fixed sum.  But in his later transactions Artemus would havenothing to do with them, much preferring to undertake all the riskhimself.  The last speculator to whom he sold himself for a tourwas, I believe, Mr. Wilder, of New York City, who realised a largeprofit by investing in lecturing stock, and who was always ready toengage a circus, a wild-beast show, or a lecturing celebrity.As a rule Artemus Ward succeeded in pleasing every one in hisaudience, especially those who understood the character of the manand the drift of his lecture; but there were not wanting at any ofhis lectures a few obtuse-minded, slowly-perceptive, drowsy-headeddullards, who had not the remotest idea what the entertainer wastalking about, nor why those around him indulged in laughter.Artemus was quick to detect these little spots upon the sunny faceof his auditory.  He would pick them out, address himself at timesto them especially, and enjoy the bewilderment of his Boeotianpatrons.  Sometimes a stolid inhabitant of central New York,evidently of Dutch extraction, would regard him with an open stareexpressive of a desire to enjoy that which was said if the point ofthe joke could by any possibility be indicated to him.  At othertimes a demure Pennsylvania Quaker would benignly survey the poorlecturer with a look of benevolent pity; and on one occasion, whenmy friend was lecturing at Peoria, an elderly lady, accompanied byher two daughters, left the room in the midst of the lecture,exclaiming, as she passed me at the door, "It is too bad of peopleto laugh at a poor young man who doesn't know what he is saying, andought to be sent to a lunatic asylum!"The newspaper reporters were invariably puzzled in attempting togive any correct idea of a lecture by Artemus Ward.  No report couldfairly convey an idea of the entertainment; and being fully aware ofthis, Artemus would instruct his agent to beg of the papers not toattempt giving any abstract of that which he said.  The following isthe way in which the reporter of the Golden Era, at San Francisco,California, endeavoured to inform the San Franciscan public of thecharacter of "The Babes in the Wood" lecture.  It is, as the readerwill perceive, a burlesque on the way in which Artemus himself dealtwith the topic he had chosen; while it also notes one or two of thesalient features of my friend's style of Lecturing:"HOW ARTEMUS WARD 'SPOKE A PIECE.'""Artemus has arrived.  Artemus has spoken.  Artemus has triumphed.Great is Artemus!"Great also is Platt's Hall.  But Artemus is greater; for the hallproved too small for his audience, and too circumscribed for theimmensity of his jokes.  A man who has drank twenty bottles of winemay be called `full.'  A pint bottle with a quart of water in itwould also be accounted full; and so would an hotel be, every bed init let three times over on the same night to three differentoccupants; but none of these would be so full as Platt's Hall was onFriday night to hear Artemus Ward `speak a piece.'"The piece selected was `The Babes in the Wood,' which reminds usthat Mr. Ward is a tall, slender-built, fair-complexioned,jovial-looking gentleman of about twenty-seven years of age.  He hasa pleasant manner, an agreeable style, and a clear, distinct, andpowerful voice."'The Babes in the Wood' is a 'comic oration,' with a mostcomprehensive grasp of subject.  As spoken by its witty author, itelicited gusto of laughter and whirlwinds of applause.  Mr. Ward isno prosy lyceum lecturer.  His style is neither scientific,didactic, or philosophical.  It is simply that of a man who isbrimful of mirth, wit, and satire, and who is compelled to let itflow forth.  Maintaining a very grave countenance himself, he playsupon the muscles of other people's faces as though they were piano-strings, and he the prince of pianists."The story of 'The Babes in the Wood' is interesting in the extreme.We would say, en passant, however, that Artemus Ward is a perfectsteam factory of puns and a museum of American humour.  Humanityseems to him to be a vast mine, out of which he digs tons of fun;and life a huge forest, in which he can cut down 'cords' ofcomicality.  Language with him is like the brass balls with whichthe juggler amuses us at the circus--ever being tossed up, everglittering, ever thrown about at pleasure.  We intended to reporthis lecture in full, but we laughed till we split our lead pencil,and our shorthand symbols were too infused with merriment to remainsteady on the paper.  However, let us proceed to give an idea of'The Babes in the Wood.'  In the first place, it is a comic oration;that is, it is spoken, is exuberant in fun, felicitous in fancy,teeming with jokes, and sparkling as bright waters on a sunny day.The 'Babes in the Wood' is--that is, it isn't a lecture or anoratorical effort; it is something sui generis; something reservedfor our day and generation, which it would never have done for ourforefathers to have known, or they would have been too mirthful tohave attended to the business of preparing the world for our coming;and something which will provoke so much laughter in our time, thatthe echo of the laughs will reverberate along the halls of futurity,and seriously affect the nerves of future generations."The 'Babes in the Wood,' to describe it, is--Well, those wholistened to it know best.  At any rate, they will acknowledge withus that it was a great success, and that Artemus Ward has a fortunebefore him in California."And now to tell the story of 'The Babes in the Wood'--But we willnot, for the hall was not half large enough to accommodate those whocame, consequently Mr. Ward will tell it over again at theMetropolitan Theatre next Tuesday evening.  The subject will againbe 'The Babes in the Wood.'"Having travelled over the Union with "The Babes in the Wood"lecture, and left his audiences everywhere fully "in the wood" asregarded the subject announced in the title, Artemus Ward becamedesirous of going over the same ground again.  There were notwanting dreary and timid prophets who told him that having "sold"his audiences once, he would not succeed in gaining large houses asecond time.  But the faith of Artemus in the unsuspecting nature ofthe public was very large, so with fearless intrepidity he conceivedthe happy thought of inventing a new title, but keeping to the sameold lecture, interspersing it here and there with a few fresh jokes,incidental to new topics of the times.  Just at this period GeneralMcClellan was advancing on Richmond, and the celebrated fight atBull's Run had become matter of history.  The forcible abolition ofslavery had obtained a place among the debates of the day, HintonRowan Helper's book on "The Inevitable Crisis" had been sold atevery bookstall, and the future of the negro had risen into theposition of being the great point of discussion throughout the land.Artemus required a very slender thread to string his jokes upon, andwhat better one could be found than that which he chose?  Headvertised the title of his next lecture as "Sixty Minutes inAfrica."  I need scarcely say that he had never been in Africa, andin all probability had never read a book on African travel.  He knewnothing about it, and that was the very reason he should chooseAfrica for his subject.  I believe that he carried out the joke sofar as to have a map made of the African continent, and that on afew occasions, but not on all, he had it suspended in thelecture-room.  It was in Philadelphia and at the Musical Fund Hallin Locust Street that I first heard him deliver what he jocularlyphrased to me as "My African Revelation."  The hall was verythronged, the audience must have exceeded two thousand in number,and the evening was unusually warm.  Artemus came on the rostrumwith a roll of paper in his hands, and used it to play withthroughout the lecture, just as recently at the Egyptian Hall, whilelecturing on the Mormons, he invariably made use of a lady's riding-whip for the same purpose.  He commenced his lecture thus, speakingvery gravely and with long pauses between his sentences, allowinghis audience to laugh if they pleased, but seeming to utterlydisregard their laughter:"I have invited you to listen to a discourse upon Africa.  Africa ismy subject.  It is a very large subject.  It has the Atlantic Oceanon its left side, the Indian Ocean on its right, and more water thanyou could measure out at its smaller end.Africa produces blacks--ivory blacks--they get ivory.  It alsoproduces deserts, and that is the reason it is so much deserted bytravellers.  Africa is famed for its roses.  It has the red rose,the white rose, and the neg-rose.  Apropos of negroes, let me tellyou a little story."Then he at once diverged from the subject of Africa to retail to hisaudience his amusing story of the Conversion of a Negro, which hesubsequently worked up into an article in the Savage Club Papers,and entitled "Converting the Nigger."  Never once again in thecourse of the lecture did he refer to Africa, until the time havingarrived for him to conclude, and the people being fairly worn outwith laughter, he finished up by saying, "Africa, ladies andgentlemen, is my subject.  You wish me to tell you something aboutAfrica.  Africa is on the map--it is on all the maps of Africa thatI have ever seen.  You may buy a good map for a dollar, and if youstudy it well, you will know more about Africa than I do.  It is acomprehensive subject, too vast, I assure you, for me to enter uponto-night.  You would not wish me to, I feel that--I feel it deeply,and I am very sensitive.  If you go home and go to bed it will bebetter for you than to go with me to Africa."The joke about the "neg-rose" has since run the gauntlet of nearlyall the minstrel bands throughout England and America.  All the"bones," every "middle-man," and all "end-men" of the burnt-corkprofession have used Artemus Ward as a mine wherein to dig for theore which provokes laughter.  He has been the "cause of wit inothers," and the bread-winner for many dozens of black-facesongsters--"singists" as he used to term them.  He was just as fondof visiting their entertainments as they were of appropriating hisjokes; and among his best friends in New York were the brothersMessrs Neil and Dan Bryant, who have made a fortune by what has beenfacetiously termed "the burnt-cork opera."It was in his "Sixty Minutes in Africa" lecture that Artemus Wardfirst introduced his celebrated satire on the negro, which hesubsequently put into print.  "The African," said he, "may be ourbrother.  Several highly respectable gentlemen and some talentedfemales tell me that he is, and for argument's sake I might beinduced to grant it, though I don't believe it myself.  But theAfrican isn't our sister, and wife, and uncle.  He isn't several ofour brothers and first wife's relations.  He isn't our grandfatherand great grandfather, and our aunt in the country.  Scarcely."It may easily be imagined how popular this joke became when it isremembered that it was first perpetrated at a time when the negroquestion was so much debated as to have become an absolute nuisance.Nothing else was talked of; nobody would talk of anything but thenegro.  The saying arose that all Americans had "nigger-onthe-brain."  The topic had become nauseous, especially to theDemocratic party; and Artemus always had more friends among themthan among the Republicans.  If he had any politics at all he wascertainly a Democrat.War had arisen, the South was closed, and the lecturing arenaconsiderably lessened.  Artemus Ward determined to go to California.Before starting for that side of the American continent, he wishedto appear in the city of New York.  He engaged, through his friendMr. De Walden, the large hall then known as Niblo's, in front of theNiblo's Garden Theatre, and now used, I believe, as the dining-roomof the Metropolitan Hotel.  At that period Pepper's Ghost chanced tobe the great novelty of New York City, and Artemus Ward was castingabout for a novel title to his old lecture.  Whether he or Mr. DeWalden selected that of "Artemus Ward's Struggle with a Ghost" I donot know; but I think that it was Mr. De Walden's choice.  The titlewas seasonable, and the lecture successful.  Then came the tour toCalifornia, whither I proceeded in advance to warn the miners on theYuba, the travellers on the Rio Sacramento, and the citizens of theChrysopolis of the Pacific that "A. Ward" would be there shortly.In California the lecture was advertised under its old name of "TheBabes in the Wood."  Platt's Hall was selected for the scene ofoperation, and, so popular was the lecturer, that on the first nightwe took at the doors more than sixteen hundred dollars in gold.  Thecrowd proved too great to take money in the ordinary manner, andhats were used for people to throw their dollars in.  One hat brokethrough at the crown.  I doubt if we ever knew to a dollar how manydollars it once contained.California was duly travelled over, and "The Babes in the Wood"listened to with laughter in its flourishing cities, itsmining-camps among the mountains, and its "new placers besidegold-bedded rivers.  While journeying through that strangely-beautiful land, the serious question arose--What was to be donenext?  After California--where?Before leaving New York, it had been a favourite scheme of ArtemusWard not to return from California to the East by way of Panama, butto come home across the Plains, and to visit Salt Lake City by theway.  The difficulty that now presented itself was, that winter wasclose upon us, and that it was no pleasant thing to cross the SierraNevada and scale the Rocky Mountains with the thermometer far belowfreezingpoint.  Nor was poor Artemus even at that time a strong man.My advice was to return to Panama, visit the West India Islands, andcome back to California in the spring, lecture again in SanFrancisco, and then go on to the land of the Mormons.  Artemusdoubted the feasibility of this plan, and the decision wasultimately arrived at to try the journey to Salt Lake.Unfortunately the winter turned out to be one of the severest.  Whenwe arrived at Salt Lake City, my poor friend was seized with typhoidfever, resulting from the fatigue we had undergone, the intense coldto which we had been subjected, and the excitement of being on ajourney of 3500 miles across the North American Continent, when thePacific Railway had made little progress and the Indians werereported not to be very friendly.The story of the trip is told in Artemus Ward's lecture.  I haveadded to it, at the special request of the publisher, a fewexplanatory notes, the purport of which is to render the readeracquainted with the characteristics of the lecturer's delivery.  Forthe benefit of those who never had an opportunity of seeing ArtemusWard nor of hearing him lecture, I may be pardoned for attempting todescribe the man himself.In stature he was tall, in figure, slender.  At any time during ouracquaintance his height must have been disproportionate to hisweight.  Like his brother Cyrus, who died a few years before him;Charles F. Browne, our "Artemus Ward," had the premonitory signs ofa short life strongly evident in his early manhood.  There were thelank form, the long pale fingers, the very white pearly teeth, thethin, fine, soft hair, the undue brightness of the eyes, theexcitable and even irritable disposition, the capricious appetite,and the alternately jubilant and despondent tone of mind which toofrequently indicate that "the abhorred fury with the shears" iswaiting too near at hand to "slit the thin-spun life."  His hair wasvery light-colored, and not naturally curly.  He used to joke in hislecture about what it cost him to keep it curled; he wore a verylarge moustache without any beard or whiskers; his nose wasexceedingly prominent, having an outline not unlike that of the lateSir Charles Napier.  His forehead was large, with, to use thelanguage of the phrenologists, the organs of the perceptivefaculties far more developed than those of the imaginative powers.He had the manner and bearing of a naturally-born gentleman.  Greatwas the disappointment of many who, having read his humorous papersdescriptive of his exhibition of snakes and waxwork, and who havingalso formed their ideas of him from the absurd pictures which hadbeen attached to some editions of his works, found on meeting withhim that there was no trace of the showman in his deportment, andlittle to call up to their mind the smart Yankee who had married"Betsy Jane."  There was nothing to indicate that he had not lived along time in Europe and acquired the polish which men gain by comingin contact with the society of European capitals.  In hisconversation there was no marked peculiarity of accent to identifyhim as an American, nor any of the braggadocio which some of hiscountrymen unadvisedly assume.  His voice was soft, gentle, andclear.  He could make himself audible in the largest lecture-roomswithout effort.  His style of lecturing was peculiar; so thoroughlysui generis, that I know of no one with whom to compare him, nor canany description very well convey an idea of that which it was like.However much he caused his audience to laugh, no smile appeared uponhis own face.  It was grave, even to solemnity, while he was givingutterance to the most delicious absurdities.  His assumption ofindifference to that which he was saying, his happy manner ofletting his best jokes fall from his lips as if unconscious of theirbeing jokes at all, his thorough self-possession on the platform,and keen appreciation of that which suited his audience and thatwhich did not, rendered him well qualified for the task which he hadundertaken--that of amusing the public with a humorous lecture.  Heunderstood and comprehended to a hair's breadth the grand secret ofhow not to bore.  He had weighed, measured, and calculated to anicety the number of laughs an audience could indulge in on oneevening, without feeling that they were laughing just a little toomuch.  Above all, he was no common man, and did not cause hisaudience to feel that they were laughing at that which they shouldfeel ashamed of being amused with.  He was intellectually up to thelevel of nine-tenths of those who listened to him, and in listening,they felt that it was no fool who wore the cap and bells soexcellently.  It was amusing to notice how with different people hisjokes produced a different effect.  The Honourable Robert Loweattended one evening at the Mormon Lecture, and laughed ashilariously as any one in the room.  The next evening Mr. JohnBright happened to be present.  With the exception of one or twooccasional smiles, he listened with grave attention.In placing the lecture before the public in print, it is impossible,by having recourse to any system of punctuation, to indicate thepauses, jerky emphases, and odd inflexions of voice whichcharacterised the delivery.  The reporter of the Standard newspaper,describing his first lecture in London, aptly said: "Artemus droppedhis jokes faster than the meteors of last night succeeded each otherin the sky.  And there was this resemblance between the flashes ofhis humour and the flights of the meteors, that in each case onelooked for jokes or meteors, but they always came just in the placethat one least expected to find them.  Half the enjoyment of theevening lay, to some of those present, in listening to the heartycachinnation of the people who only found out the jokes some two orthree minutes after they were made, and who then laughed apparentlyat some grave statements of fact.  Reduced to paper, the showman'sjokes are certainly not brilliant; almost their whole effect lies intheir seemingly impromptu character.  They are carefully led up to,of course; but they are uttered as if they are mere afterthoughts,of which the speaker is hardly sure."  Herein the writer in theStandard hits the most marked peculiarity of Artemus Ward's style oflecturing.  His affectation of not knowing what he was uttering, hisseeming fits of abstraction, and his grave, melancholy aspect,constituted the very cream of the entertainment.  Occasionally hewould amuse himself in an apparently meditative mood, by twirlinghis little riding-whip, or by gazing earnestly, but with affectedadmiration, at his panorama.  At the Egyptian Hall his healthentirely failed him, and he would occasionally have to use a seatduring the course of the lecture.  In the notes which follow I havetried, I know how inefficiently, to convey here and there an idea ofhow Artemus rendered his lecture amusing by gesture or action.  Ihave also, at the request of the publisher, made a few explanatorycomments on the subject of our Mormon trip.  In so doing I hope thatI have not thrust myself too prominently forward, nor been tooofficious in my explanations.  My aim has been to add to theinterest of the lecture with those who never heard it delivered, andto revive in the memory of those who did some of its notablepeculiarities.  The illustrations are from photographs of thepanorama painted in America for Artemus, as the pictorial portion ofhis entertainment.In the lecture is the fun of the journey.  For the hard facts thereader in quest of information is referred to a book publishedpreviously to the lecturer's appearance at the Egyptian Hall, thetitle of which is, "Artemus Ward:  His Travels among the Mormons."Much against the grain as it was for Artemus to be statistical, hehas therein detailed some of the experiences of his Mormon trip,with due regard to the exactitude and accuracy of statement expectedby information-seeking readers in a book of travels.  He was notprecisely the sort of traveller to write a paper for the eveningmeetings of the Royal Geographical Society, nor was he sufficientlyinterested in philosophical theories to speculate on thedevelopments of Mormonism as illustrative of the history ofreligious belief.  We were looking out of the window of the SaltLake House one morning, when Brigham Young happened to pass down theopposite side of Main Street.  It was cold weather, and the prophetwas clothed in a thick cloak of some green-colored material.  Iremarked to Artemus that Brigham had seemingly compounded Mormonismfrom portions of a dozen different creeds; and that in selectinggreen for the color of his apparel, he was imitating Mahomet.  "Hasit not struck you," I observed, "that Swedenborgianism andMahometanism are oddly blended in the Mormon faith?""Petticoatism and plunder," was Artemus's reply--and thatcomprehended his whole philosophy of Mormonism.  As he remarkedelsewhere:  "Brigham Young is a man of great natural ability.  If youask me, How pious is he? I treat it as a conundrum, and give it up."To lecture in London, and at the Egyptian Hall, had long been afavourite idea of Artemus Ward.  Some humorist has said, that "Allgood Americans, when they die--, go to Paris."  So do most, whethergood or bad, while they are living.Still more strongly developed is the transatlantic desire to go toRome.  In the far west of the Missouri, in the remoter west ofColorado and away in far north-western Oregon, I have heard many atradesman express his intention to make dollars enough to enable himto visit Rome.  In a land where all is so new, where they have hadno past, where an old wall would be a sensation, and a tombstone ofanybody's great grandfather the marvel of the whole region, thecharms of the old world have an irresistible fascination.  To visitthe home of the Caesars they have read of in their school-books, andto look at architecture which they have seen pictorially, but havenothing like it in existence around them, is very naturally thestrong wish of people who are nationally nomadic, and who have allmore or less a smattering of education.  Artemus Ward neverexpressed to me any very great wish to travel on the Europeancontinent, but to see London was to accomplish something which hehad dreamed of from his boyhood.  There runs from Marysville inCalifornia to Oroville in the same State a short and singular littlerailway, which, when we were there, was in a most unfinishedcondition.  To Oroville we were going.  We were too early for thetrain at the Marysville station, and sat down on a pile of timber tochat over future prospects."What sort of a man was Albert Smith?" asked Artemus "And do youthink that the Mormons would be as good a subject for the Londonersas Mont Blanc was?"I answered his questions.  He reflected for a few moments, and thensaid:"Well, old fellow, I'll tell you what I should like to do.  I shouldlike to go to London and give my lecture in the same place.  Can itbe done?"It was done.  Not in the same room, but under the same roof and onthe same floor; in that gloomy-looking Hall in Piccadilly, which wasdestined to be the ante-chamber to the tomb of both lecturers.Throughout this brief sketch I have written familiarly of the lateMr. Charles F. Browne as "Artemus Ward," or simply as "Artemus."  Ihave done so advisedly, mainly because, during the whole course ofour acquaintance, I do not remember addressing him as "Mr. Browne,"or by his real Christian name.  To me he was always "Artemus"--Artemus the kind, the gentle, the suave, the generous.  One who wasever a friend in the fullest meaning of the word, and the best ofcompanions in the amplest acceptance of the phrase.  His merry laughand pleasant conversation are as audible to me as if they were heardbut yesterday; his words of kindness linger on the ear of memory,and his tones of genial mirth live in echoes which I shall listen tofor evermore.  Two years will soon have passed away since last hespoke, and           "Silence now, enamour'd of his voice            Looks its mute music in her rugged cell."                                            E.P. HINGSTON.LONDON, October 1868.*  *  *ARTEMUS WARD.PART I.ESSAYS, SKETCHES, AND LETTERS.1.1.  ONE OF MR.

I know thay do, becawz Inever saw a man whoos didn't.Respectively yures,A. Ward.P.S.--You scratch my back & Ile scratch your back.1.2.  ON "FORTS."Every man has got a Fort.  It's sum men's fort to do one thing,and some other men's fort to do another, while there is numerisshiftliss critters goin round loose whose fort is not to donothin.Shakspeer rote good plase, but he wouldn't hav succeeded as aWashington correspondent of a New York daily paper.  He lackt therekesit fancy and imagginashun.That's so!Old George Washington's Fort was not to hev eny public man of thepresent day resemble him to eny alarmin extent.  Whare bowts canGeorge's ekal be found?  I ask, & boldly anser no whares, or enywhare else.Old man Townsin's Fort was to maik Sassyperiller.  "Goy to theworld! anuther life saived!"  (Cotashun from Townsin'sadvertisemunt.)Cyrus Field's Fort is to lay a sub-machine tellegraf under theboundin billers of the Oshun, and then hev it Bust.Spaldin's Fort is to maik Prepared Gloo, which mends everything.Wonder ef it will mend a sinner's wickid waze?  (Impromptoogoak.)Zoary's Fort is to be a femaile circus feller.My Fort is the grate moral show bizniss & ritin choice famerlyliteratoor for the noospapers.  That's what's the matter with ME.&c., &c., &c.  So I mite go on to a indefnit extent.Twict I've endeverd to do things which thay wasn't my Fort.  Thefust time was when I undertuk to lick a owdashus cuss who cut ahole in my tent & krawld threw.  Sez I, "my jentle Sir go out orI shall fall onto you putty hevy."  Sez he, "Wade in, Old waxfiggers," whareupon I went for him, but he cawt me powerful onthe hed & knockt me threw the tent into a cow pastur.  He pursoodthe attack & flung me into a mud puddle.  As I aroze & rung outmy drencht garmints I koncluded fitin wasn't my Fort.  Ile nowrize the kurtin upon Seen 2nd:  It is rarely seldum that I seekconsolation in the Flowin Bole.  But in a sertin town in Injiannyin the Faul of 18--, my orgin grinder got sick with the fever &died.  I never felt so ashamed in my life, & I thowt I'd hist ina few swallows of suthin strengthin.  Konsequents was I histid inso much I dident zackly know whare bowts I was. I turnd my livinwild beests of Pray loose into the streets and spilt all my waxwurks.  I then Bet I cood play hoss.  So I hitched myself to aKanawl bote, there bein two other hosses hitcht on also, onebehind and anuther ahead of me.  The driver hollerd for us to gitup, and we did.  But the hosses bein onused to sich a arrangemuntbegun to kick & squeal and rair up.  Konsequents was I was kicktvilently in the stummuck & back, and presuntly I fownd myself inthe Kanawl with the other hosses, kickin & yellin like a tribe ofCusscaroorus savvijis.  I was rescood, & as I was bein carrid tothe tavern on a hemlock Bored I sed in a feeble voise, "Boys,playin hoss isn't my Fort."MORUL--Never don't do nothin which isn't your Fort, for ef you doyou'll find yourself splashin round in the Kanawl, figgerativelyspeakin.1.3.  THE SHAKERS.The Shakers is the strangest religious sex I ever met.  I'd hearntell of 'em and I'd seen 'em, with their broad brim'd hats andlong wastid coats; but I'd never cum into immejit contack with'em, and I'd sot 'em down as lackin intelleck, as I'd never seen'em to my Show--leastways, if they cum they was disgised in whitepeple's close, so I didn't know 'em.But in the Spring of 18--, I got swampt in the exterior of NewYork State, one dark and stormy night, when the winds Bluepityusly, and I was forced to tie up with the Shakers.I was toilin threw the mud, when in the dim vister of the futer Iobsarved the gleams of a taller candle.  Tiein a hornet's nest tomy off hoss's tail to kinder encourage him, I soon reached theplace.  I knockt at the door, which it was opened unto me by atall, slick-faced, solum lookin individooal, who turn'd out to bea Elder."Mr. Shaker," sed I, "you see before you a Babe in the woods, soto speak, and he axes shelter of you.""Yay," sed the Shaker, and he led the way into the house, anotherShaker bein sent to put my hosses and waggin under kiver.A solum female, lookin sumwhat like a last year's beanpole stuckinto a long meal bag, cum in axed me was I athurst and did Ihunger? to which I urbanely anserd "a few."  She went orf and Iendeverd to open a conversashun with the old man."Elder, I spect?" sed I."Yay," he said."Helth's good, I reckon?""Yay.""What's the wages of a Elder, when he understans his bizness--ordo you devote your sarvices gratooitus?""Yay.""Stormy night, sir.""Yay.""If the storm continners there'll be a mess underfoot, hay?""Yay.""It's onpleasant when there's a mess underfoot?""Yay.""If I may be so bold, kind sir, what's the price of that pecoolerkind of weskit you wear, incloodin trimmins?""Yay!"I pawsd a minit, and then, thinkin I'd be faseshus with him andsee how that would go, I slapt him on the shoulder, bust into aharty larf, and told him that as a yayer he had no livin ekal.He jumpt up as if Bilin water had bin squirted into his ears,groaned, rolled his eyes up tords the sealin and sed:  "You're aman of sin!"  He then walkt out of the room.Jest then the female in the meal bag stuck her hed into the roomand statid that refreshments awaited the weary travler, and I sedif it was vittles she ment the weary travler was agreeable, and Ifollored her into the next room.I sot down to the table and the female in the meal bag pored outsum tea.  She sed nothin, and for five minutes the only livething in that room was a old wooden clock, which tickt in asubdood and bashful manner in the corner.  This dethly stillnessmade me oneasy, and I determined to talk to the female or bust.So sez I, "marrige is agin your rules, I bleeve, marm?""Yay.""The sexes liv strickly apart, I spect?""Yay.""It's kinder singler," sez I, puttin on my most sweetest look andspeakin in a winnin voice, "that so fair a made as thow never gothitched to some likely feller."  [N.B.--She was upards of 40 andhomely as a stump fence, but I thawt I'd tickil her.]"I don't like men!" she sed, very short."Wall, I dunno," sez I, "they're a rayther important part of thepopulashun.  I don't scacely see how we could git along without'em.""Us poor wimin folks would git along a grate deal better if therewas no men!""You'll excoos me, marm, but I don't think that air would work.It wouldn't be regler.""I'm fraid of men!" she sed."That's onnecessary, marm.  YOU ain't in no danger.  Don't fretyourself on that pint.""Here we're shot out from the sinful world.  Here all is peas.Here we air brothers and sisters.  We don't marry and consekentlywe hav no domestic difficulties.  Husbans don't abooze theirwives--wives don't worrit their husbans.  There's no childrenhere to worrit us.  Nothin to worrit us here.  No wickedmatrimony here.  Would thow like to be a Shaker?""No," sez I, "it ain't my stile."I had now histed in as big a load of pervishuns as I could carrycomfortable, and, leanin back in my cheer, commenst pickin myteeth with a fork.  The female went out, leavin me all alone withthe clock.  I hadn't sot thar long before the Elder poked his hedin at the door.  "You're a man of sin!" he sed, and groaned andwent away.Direckly thar cum in two young Shakeresses, as putty and slicklookin gals as I ever met.  It is troo they was drest in mealbags like the old one I'd met previsly, and their shiny, silkyhar was hid from sight by long white caps, sich as I spose femaleJosts wear; but their eyes sparkled like diminds, their cheekswas like roses, and they was charmin enuff to make a man throwstuns at his granmother if they axed him to.  They comenstclearin away the dishes, castin shy glances at me all the time.I got excited.  I forgot Betsy Jane in my rapter, and sez I, "mypretty dears, how air you?""We air well," they solumly sed."Whar's the old man?" sed I, in a soft voice."Of whom dost thow speak--Brother Uriah?""I mean the gay and festiv cuss who calls me a man of sin.Shouldn't wonder if his name was Uriah.""He has retired.""Wall, my pretty dears," sez I, "let's have sum fun.  Let's playpuss in the corner.  What say?""Air you a Shaker, sir?" they axed."Wall my pretty dears, I haven't arrayed my proud form in a longweskit yit, but if they was all like you perhaps I'd jine 'em.As it is, I'm a Shaker pro-temporary."They was full of fun.  I seed that at fust, only they was aleetle skeery. I tawt 'em Puss in the corner and sich like plase,and we had a nice time, keepin quiet of course so the old manshouldn't hear.  When we broke up, sez I, "my pretty dears, ear Igo you hav no objections, hav you, to a innersent kiss atpartin?""Yay," they said, and I YAY'D.I went up stairs to bed.  I spose I'd bin snoozin half an hourwhen I was woke up by a noise at the door.  I sot up in bed,leanin on my elbers and rubbin my eyes, and I saw the follerinpicter:  The Elder stood in the doorway, with a taller candle inhis hand.  He hadn't no wearin appeerel on except his nightclose, which flutterd in the breeze like a Seseshun flag. He sed,"You're a man of sin!" then groaned and went away.I went to sleep agin, and drempt of runnin orf with the prettylittle Shakeresses mounted on my Californy Bar.  I thawt the Barinsisted on steerin strate for my dooryard in Baldinsville andthat Betsy Jane cum out and giv us a warm recepshun with apanfull of Bilin water.  I was woke up arly by the Elder.  Hesaid refreshments was reddy for me down stairs.  Then sayin I wasa man of sin, he went groanin away.As I was goin threw the entry to the room where the vittles was,I cum across the Elder and the old female I'd met the nightbefore, and what d'ye spose they was up to?  Huggin and kissinlike young lovers in their gushingist state.  Sez I, "my Shakerfriends, I reckon you'd better suspend the rules and gitmarried.""You must excoos Brother Uriah," sed the female; "he's subjeck tofits and hain't got no command over hisself when he's into 'em.""Sartinly," sez I, "I've bin took that way myself frequent.""You're a man of sin!" sed the Elder.Arter breakfust my little Shaker frends cum in agin to clear awaythe dishes."My pretty dears," sez I, "shall we YAY agin?""Nay," they sed, and I NAY'D.The Shakers axed me to go to their meetin, as they was to havsarvices that mornin, so I put on a clean biled rag and went.The meetin house was as neat as a pin.  The floor was white aschalk and smooth as glass.  The Shakers was all on hand, in cleanweskits and meal bags, ranged on the floor like milingterycompanies, the mails on one side of the room and the females ontother.  They commenst clappin their hands and singin and dancin.They danced kinder slow at fust, but as they got warmed up theyshaved it down very brisk, I tell you.  Elder Uriah, inparticler, exhiberted a right smart chance of spryness in hislegs, considerin his time of life, and as he cum a dubble shufflenear where I sot, I rewarded him with a approvin smile and sed:"Hunky boy!  Go it, my gay and festiv cuss!""You're a man of sin!" he sed, continnerin his shuffle.The Sperret, as they called it, then moved a short fat Shaker tosay a few remarks.  He sed they was Shakers and all was ekal.They was the purest and Seleckest peple on the yearth.  Otherpeple was sinful as they could be, but Shakers was all right.Shakers was all goin kerslap to the Promist Land, and nobody wantgoin to stand at the gate to bar 'em out, if they did they'd gitrun over.The Shakers then danced and sung agin, and arter they was threw,one of 'em axed me what I thawt of it.Sez I, "What duz it siggerfy?""What?" sez he."Why this jumpin up and singin?  This long weskit bizniss, andthis anty-matrimony idee?  My frends, you air neat and tidy.Your lands is flowin with milk and honey.  Your brooms is fine,and your apple sass is honest.  When a man buys a keg of applesass of you he don't find a grate many shavins under a few layersof sass--a little Game I'm sorry to say sum of my New Englanancesters used to practiss.  Your garding seeds is fine, and if Ishould sow 'em on the rock of Gibralter probly I should raise agood mess of garding sass.  You air honest in your dealins.  Youair quiet and don't distarb nobody.  For all this I givs youcredit.  But your religion is small pertaters, I must say.  Youmope away your lives here in single retchidness, and as you airall by yourselves nothing ever conflicks with your pecooleridees, except when Human Nater busts out among you, as Iunderstan she sumtimes do.  [I giv Uriah a sly wink here, whichmade the old feller squirm like a speared Eel.]  You wear longweskits and long faces, and lead a gloomy life indeed.  Nochildren's prattle is ever hearn around your harthstuns--you airin a dreary fog all the time, and you treat the jolly sunshine oflife as tho' it was a thief, drivin it from your doors by themweskits, and meal bags, and pecooler noshuns of yourn.  The galsamong you, sum of which air as slick pieces of caliker as I eversot eyes on, air syin to place their heds agin weskits whichkiver honest, manly harts, while you old heds fool yerselves withthe idee that they air fulfillin their mishun here, and aircontented.  Here you air all pend up by yerselves, talkin aboutthe sins of a world you don't know nothin of.  Meanwhile saidworld continners to resolve round on her own axletree onct inevery 24 hours, subjeck to the Constitution of the United States,and is a very plesant place of residence.  It's a unnatral,onreasonable and dismal life you're leadin here.  So it strikesme.  My Shaker frends, I now bid you a welcome adoo.  You havtreated me exceedin well.  Thank you kindly, one and all."A base exhibiter of depraved monkeys and onprincipled waxworks!" sed Uriah."Hello, Uriah," sez I, "I'd most forgot you.

HIGH-HANDED OUTRAGE AT UTICA.In the Faul of 1856, I showed my show in Uticky, a trooly gratesitty in the State of New York.The people gave me a cordyal recepshun.  The press was loud inher prases.1 day as I was givin a descripshun of my Beests and Snaiks in myusual flowry stile what was my skorn disgust to see a big burlyfeller walk up to the cage containin my wax figgers of the Lord'sLast Supper, and cease Judas Iscarrot by the feet and drag himout on the ground.

CELEBRATION AT BALDINSVILLE IN HONOR OF THE ATLANTIC CABLE.Baldinsville, Injianny, Sep. the onct, 18&58.--I was summund homefrom Cinsinnaty quite suddin by a lettur from the Supervizers ofBaldinsville, sayin as how grate things was on the Tappis in thatair town in refferunse to sellebratin the compleshun of theSub-Mershine Tellergraph & axkin me to be Pressunt.  Lockin up myKangeroo and wax wurks in a sekure stile I took my departer forBaldinsville--"my own, my nativ lan," which I gut intwo at earlykandle litin on the follerin night & just as the sellerbrashunand illumernashun ware commensin.Baldinsville was trooly in a blaze of glory.  Near can I forgitthe surblime speckticul which met my gase as I alited from theStaige with my umbreller and verlis.  The Tarvern was lit up withtaller kandles all over & a grate bon fire was burnin in fruntthareof.  A Traspirancy was tied onto the sine post with thefollerin wurds--"Giv us Liberty or Deth."  Old Tompkinsis groserywas illumernated with 5 tin lantuns and the follerin Transpirancywas in the winder--"The Sub-Mershine Tellergraph & theBaldinsville and Stonefield Plank Road--the 2 grate eventz of the19th centerry--may intestines strife never mar their grandjure."Simpkinsis shoe shop was all ablase with kandles and lantuns.  AAmerican Eagle was painted onto a flag in a winder--also thesewurds, viz.--"The Constitooshun must be Presarved."  The Skoolhouse was lited up in grate stile and the winders was filld withmottoes amung which I notised the follerin--"Trooth smashed toerth shall rize agin--YOU CAN'T STOP HER."  "The Boy stood on theBurnin Deck whense awl but him had Fled."  "Prokrastinashun isthe theaf of Time."  "Be virtoous & you will be Happy.""Intemperunse has cawsed a heap of trubble--shun the Bole," anthe follerin sentimunt written by the skool master, who graduatedat Hudson Kollige:  "Baldinsville sends greetin to Her Magistythe Queen, & hopes all hard feelins which has heretofore previsbin felt between the Supervizers of Baldinsville and the BritishParlimunt, if such there has been, may now be forever wiped frumour Escutchuns.  Baldinsville this night rejoises over thegerlorious event which sementz 2 grate nashuns onto one anutherby means of a elecktric wire under the roarin billers of theNasty Deep.  QUOSQUE TANTRUM, A BUTTER, CATERLINY, PATENTNOSTRUM!"  Squire Smith's house was lited up regardlis ofexpense.  His little sun William Henry stood upon the roof firinorf crackers.  The old 'Squire hisself was dressed up in soljerclothes and stood on his door-step, pintin his sword sollumly toa American flag which was suspendid on top of a pole in frunt ofhis house.  Frequiently he wood take orf his cocked hat & wave itround in a impressive stile.  His oldest darter Mis IsabellerSmith, who has just cum home from the Perkinsville FemaleInstertoot, appeared at the frunt winder in the West room as thegoddis of liberty, & sung "I see them on their windin way."Booteus 1, sed I to myself, you air a angil & nothin shorter. N.Boneparte Smith, the 'Squire's oldest sun, drest hisself up asVenus the God of Wars and red the Decleration of Inderpendunsefrom the left chambir winder.  The 'Squire's wife didn't jine inthe festiverties.  She sed it was the tarnulest nonsense she everseed.  Sez she to the 'Squire, "Cum into the house and go to bedyou old fool, you.  Tomorrer you'll be goin round half-ded withthe rumertism & won't gin us a minit's peace till you get well."Sez the 'Squire, "Betsy, you little appresiate the importance ofthe event which I this night commererate."  Sez she, "Commemeratea cat's tail--cum into the house this instant, you pesky oldcritter."  "Betsy," sez the 'Squire, wavin his sword, "retire."This made her just as mad as she could stick.  She retired, butcum out agin putty quick with a panfull of Bilin hot water whichshe throwed all over the Squire, & Surs, you wood have split yoursides larfin to see the old man jump up and holler & run into thehouse.  Except this unpropishus circumstance all went as merry asa carriage bell, as Lord Byrun sez.  Doctor Hutchinsis offiss waslikewise lited up and a Transpirancy, on which was painted theQueen in the act of drinkin sum of "Hutchinsis invigorater," wasstuck into one of the winders.  The Baldinsville Bugle of Libertynoospaper offiss was also illumernated, & the follerin mottoesstuck out--"The Press is the Arkermejian leaver which moves theworld."  "Vote Early."  "Buckle on your Armer."  "Now is the timeto Subscribe."  "Franklin, Morse & Field."  "Terms 1.50 dollars ayear--liberal reducshuns to clubs."  In short the villige ofBaldinsville was in a perfect fewroar.  I never seed so manypeple thar befour in my born days.  Ile not attemp to describethe seens of that grate night.  Wurds wood fale me ef I shood tryto do it.  I shall stop here a few periods and enjoy my "Oatemcum dig the tates," as our skool master observes, in the buzzumof my famerly, & shall then resume the show biznis, which Ive bininto twenty-two (22) yeres and six (6) months.1.6.  AMONG THE SPIRITS.My naburs is mourn harf crazy on the new-fangled ideas aboutSperrets.  Sperretooul Sircles is held nitely & 4 or 5 long haredfellers has settled here and gone into the Sperret biznisexcloosively.  A atemt was made to git Mrs. A. Ward to embarkinto the Sperret biznis but the atemt faled.  1 of the long haredfellers told her she was a ethereal creeter & wood make a sweetmejium, whareupon she attact him with a mop handle & drove himout of the house.  I will hear obsarve that Mrs.Ward is ainvalerble womum--the partner of my goys & the shairer of mysorrers.  In my absunse she watchis my interests & things with aEagle Eye & when I return she welcums me in afectionate stile.Trooly it is with us as it was with Mr. & Mrs. INGOMER in thePlay, to whit,--             2 soles with but a single thawt             2 harts which beet as 1.My naburs injooced me to attend a Sperretooul Sircle at SquireSmith's.  When I arrove I found the east room chock full includinall the old maids in the villige & the long hared fellers a4sed.When I went in I was salootid with "hear cums the benited man"--"hear cums the hory-heded unbeleever"--"hear cums the skoffer attrooth," etsettery, etsettery.Sez I, "my frens, it's troo I'm hear, & now bring on yourSperrets."1 of the long hared fellers riz up and sed he would state a fewremarks.  He sed man was a critter of intelleck & was movin on toa Gole.  Sum men had bigger intellecks than other men had andthay wood git to the Gole the soonerest.  Sum men was beests &wood never git into the Gole at all.  He sed the Erth wasmateriel but man was immaterial, and hens man was different fromthe Erth.  The Erth, continnered the speaker, resolves round onits own axeltree onct in 24 hours, but as man haint gut noaxeltree he cant resolve.  He sed the ethereal essunce of thekoordinate branchis of super-human natur becum mettymorfussed asman progrest in harmonial coexistunce & eventooally antyhumanized theirselves & turned into reglar sperretuellers.  (Thiswas versifferusly applauded by the cumpany, and as I make it apint to get along as pleasant as possible, I sung out "bully foryou, old boy.")The cumpany then drew round the table and the Sircle kommenstto go it.  Thay axed me if thare was an body in the Sperret landwhich I wood like to convarse with.  I sed if Bill Tompkins, whowas onct my partner in the show biznis, was sober, I should liketo convarse with him a few periods."Is the Sperret of William Tompkins present?" sed 1 of the longhared chaps, and there was three knox on the table.Sez I, "William, how goze it, Old Sweetness?""Pretty ruff, old hoss," he replide.That was a pleasant way we had of addressin each other when hewas in the flesh."Air you in the show bizniz, William?" sed I.He sed he was.  He sed he & John Bunyan was travelin with aside show in connection with Shakspere, Jonson & Co.'s Circus.He sed old Bun (meanin Mr. Bunyan,) stired up the animils &ground the organ while he tended door. Occashunally Mr. Bunyansung a comic song.  The Circus was doin middlin well.  BillShakspeer had made a grate hit with old Bob Ridley, and BenJonson was delitin the peple with his trooly grate ax ofhossmanship without saddul or bridal.  Thay was rehersinDixey's Land & expected it would knock the peple.Sez I, "William, my luvly friend, can you pay me that 13dollars you owe me?"  He sed no with one of the most tremenjisknox I ever experiunsed.The Sircle sed he had gone.  "Air you gone, William?" I axed."Rayther," he replide, and I knowd it was no use to pursoo thesubjeck furder.I then called fur my farther."How's things, daddy?""Middlin, my son, middlin.""Ain't you proud of your orfurn boy?""Scacely.""Why not, my parient?""Becawz you hav gone to writin for the noospapers, my son.Bimeby you'll lose all your character for trooth andverrasserty.  When I helpt you into the show biznis I told youto dignerfy that there profeshun.  Litteratoor is low."He also statid that he was doin middlin well in the peanutbiznis & liked it putty well, tho' the climit was rather warm.When the Sircle stopt thay axed me what I thawt of it.Sez I, "My frends I've bin into the show biznis now goin on 23years.  Theres a artikil in the Constitooshun of the UnitedStates which sez in effeck that everybody may think just as hedarn pleazes, & them is my sentiments to a hare.  You dowtlisbeleeve this Sperret doctrin while I think it is a little mixt.Just so soon as a man becums a reglar out & out Sperret rapperhe leeves orf workin, lets his hare grow all over his fase &commensis spungin his livin out of other peple.  He eats allthe dickshunaries he can find & goze round chock full of bigwords, scarein the wimmin folks & little children & destroyinthe piece of mind of evry famerlee he enters.  He don't donobody no good & is a cuss to society & a pirit on honestpeple's corn beef barrils.  Admittin all you say abowt thedoctrin to be troo, I must say the reglar perfessional Sperritrappers--them as makes a biznis on it--air abowt the mostornery set of cusses I ever enkountered in my life.  So sayin Iput on my surtoot and went home.                              Respectably Yures,                                          Artemus Ward.1.7.  ON THE WING.Gents of the Editorial Corpse.--Since I last rit you I've met with immense success a showin myshow in varis places, particly at Detroit.  I put up at Mr.Russel's tavern, a very good tavern too, but I am sorry toinform you that the clerks tried to cum a Gouge Game on me.  Ibrandished my new sixteen dollar huntin-cased watch roundconsiderable, & as I was drest in my store clothes & had a lotof sweet-scented wagon-grease on my hair, I am free to confessthat I thought I lookt putty gay.  It never once struck me thatI lookt green.  But up steps a clerk & axes me hadn't I betterput my watch in the Safe.  "Sir," sez I, "that watch costsixteen dollars!  Yes, Sir, every dollar of it!  You can't cumit over me, my boy!  Not at all, Sir."  I know'd what the clerkwanted.  He wanted that watch himself.  He wanted to makebelieve as tho he lockt it up in the safe, then he would setthe house a fire and pretend as tho the watch was destroyedwith the other property!  But he caught a Tomarter when he gothold of me.  From Detroit I go West'ard hoe. On the cars was ahe-lookin female, with a green-cotton umbreller in one hand anda handful of Reform tracks in the other.  She sed every womanshould have a Spear.  Them as didn't demand their Spears,didn't know what was good for them.  "What is my Spear?" sheaxed, addressing the people in the cars.  "Is it to stay athome & darn stockins & be the ser-LAVE of a domineerin man?  Oris it my Spear to vote & speak & show myself the ekal of a man?Is there a sister in these keers that has her proper Spear?"Sayin which the eccentric female whirled her umbreller roundseveral times, & finally jabbed me in the weskit with it."I hav no objecshuns to your goin into the Spear bizness," sezI, "but you'll please remember I ain't a pickeril.  Don't Spearme agin, if you please."  She sot down.At Ann Arbor, bein seized with a sudden faintness, I called fora drop of suthin to drink.  As I was stirrin the beverage up, apale-faced man in gold spectacles laid his hand upon myshoulder, & sed, "Look not upon the wine when it is red!"Sez I, "This ain't wine.  This is Old Rye.""'It stingeth like a Adder and biteth like a Sarpent!'" sed theman."I guess not," sed I, "when you put sugar into it.  That's theway I allers take mine.""Have you sons grown up, sir?" the man axed."Wall," I replide, as I put myself outside my beverage, "my sonArtemus junior is goin on 18.""Ain't you afraid if you set this example be4 him he'll cum toa bad end?""He's cum to a waxed end already.  He's learnin the shoe makinbizness," I replide.  "I guess we can both on us git alongwithout your assistance, Sir," I obsarved, as he was about toopen his mouth agin."This is a cold world!" sed the man."That's so.  But you'll get into a warmer one by and by if youdon't mind your own bizness better."  I was a little riled atthe feller, because I never take anythin only when I'm onwell.I arterwards learned he was a temperance lecturer, and if hecan injuce men to stop settin their inards on fire with thefrightful licker which is retailed round the country, I shallhartily rejoice.  Better give men Prusick Assid to onct, thanto pizen 'em to deth by degrees.At Albion I met with overwhelmin success.  The celebratedAlbion Female Semenary is located here, & there air over 300young ladies in the Institushun, pretty enough to eat withoutseasonin or sass.  The young ladies was very kind to me,volunteerin to pin my handbills onto the backs of theirdresses.  It was a surblime site to see over 300 young ladiesgoin round with a advertisement of A. Ward's onparaleld show,conspickusly posted onto their dresses.They've got a Panick up this way and refooze to take Westernmoney.  It never was worth much, and when western men, whoknows what it is, refooze to take their own money it is abouttime other folks stopt handlin it.  Banks are bustin every day,goin up higher nor any balloon of which we hav any record.These western bankers air a sweet & luvly set of men.  I wish Iowned as good a house as some of 'em would break into!Virtoo is its own reward.                                                   A. Ward.1.8.  THE OCTOROON.It is with no ordernary feelins of Shagrin & indignashun that Irite you these here lines.  Sum of the hiest and most purestfeelins whitch actoate the humin hart has bin trampt onto.  TheAmerycan flag has bin outrajed.  Ive bin nussin a Adder in myBoozum.  The fax in the kase is these here:A few weeks ago I left Baldinsville to go to N.Y. fur to gitout my flamin yeller hanbills fur the Summer kampane, & as Iwas peroosin a noospaper on the kars a middel aged man inspeckterkuls kum & sot down beside onto me.  He was drest inblack close & was appeerently as fine a man as ever was."A fine day, Sir," he did unto me strateway say."Middlin," sez I, not wishin to kommit myself, tho he peered tobe as fine a man as there was in the wurld--"It is a middlinfine day, Square," I obsarved.Sez he, "How fares the Ship of State in yure regine ofcountry?"Sez I, "We don't hav no ships in our State--the kanawl is ourbest holt."He pawsed a minit and then sed, "Air yu aware, Sir, that thekrisis is with us?""No," sez I, getting up and lookin under the seet, "whare isshe?""It's hear--it's everywhares," he sed.Sez I, "Why how you tawk!" and I gut up agin & lookt all round."I must say, my fren," I continnered, as I resoomed my seet,"that I kan't see nothin of no krisis myself."  I felt sumwhatalarmed, & arose & in a stentoewrian voice obsarved that if anylady or gentleman in that there kar had a krisis consealedabowt their persons they'd better projuce it to onct or sufferthe konsequences.  Several individoouls snickered rite out,while a putty little damsell rite behind me in a pinc gown madethe observashun, "He, he.""Sit down, my fren," sed the man in black close, "yumiskomprehend me.  I meen that the perlittercal ellermunts areorecast with black klouds, 4boden a friteful storm.""Wall," replide I, "in regard to perlittercal ellerfunts Idon't know as how but what they is as good as enny other kindof ellerfunts.  But I maik bold to say thay is all a ornery set& unpleasant to hav around.  They air powerful hevy eaters &take up a right smart chans of room, & besides thay air as uglyand revenjeful, as a Cusscaroarus Injun, with 13 inches of cornwhisky in his stummick."  The man in black close seemed to beas fine a man as ever was in the wurld.  He smilt & sed praps Iwas rite, tho it was ellermunts instid of ellerfunts that hewas alludin to, & axed me what was my prinserpuls?"I haint gut enny," sed I--"not a prinserpul.  Ime in the showbiznis."  The man in black close, I will hear obsarve, seemedto be as fine a man as ever was in the wurld."But," sez he, "you hav feelins into you?  You cimpathize withthe misfortunit, the loly & the hart-sick, don't you?"  He bustinto teers and axed me ef I saw that yung lady in the seet outyender, pintin to as slick a lookin gal as I ever seed.Sed I, "2 be shure I see her--is she mutch sick?"  The man inblack close was appeerently as fine a man as ever was in thewurld ennywhares."Draw closter to me," sed the man in black close.  "Let me gitmy mowth fernenst yure ear.  Hush--SHESE A OCTOROON!""No!" sez I, gittin up in a exsited manner, "yu don't say so!How long has she bin in that way?""Frum her arliest infuncy," sed he."Wall, whot upon arth duz she doo it fur?" I inquired."She kan't help it," sed the man in black close.  "It's thebrand of Kane.""Wall, she'd better stop drinkin Kane's brandy," I replide."I sed the brand of Kane was upon her--not brandy, my fren.Yure very obtoose."I was konsiderbul riled at this.  Sez I, "My gentle Sir, Ime anonresistanter as a ginral thing, & don't want to git up norows with nobuddy, but I kin nevertheles kave in enny man's hedthat calls me a obtoos," with whitch remarks I kommenst fur topull orf my extry garmints. "Cum on," sez I--"Time! hear's theBeniki Boy fur ye!" & I darnced round like a poppit.  He riz upin his seet & axed my pardin--sed it was all a mistake--that Iwas a good man, etsettery, & sow 4th, & we fixt it all uppleasant.  I must say the man in black close seamed to be asfine a man as ever lived in the wurld.  He sed a Octoroon wasthe 8th of a negrow.  He likewise statid that the female he wastravlin with was formurly a slave in Mississippy; that she'dpurchist her freedim & now wantid to purchiss the freedim ofher poor old muther, who (the man in black close obsarved) wasbetween 87 years of age & had to do all the cookin & washin for25 hired men, whitch it was rapidly breakin down her konstitushun.He sed he knowed the minit he gazed onto my klassic & beneverluntfase that I'd donate librully & axed me to go over & see her,which I accordingly did.  I sot down beside her and sed, "yureSarvant, Marm!  How do yer git along?"She bust in 2 teers & sed, "O Sur, I'm so retchid--I'm a poorunfortunit Octoroon.""So I larn.  Yure rather more Roon than Octo, I take it," sedI, fur I never seed a puttier gal in the hull endoorin time ofmy life.  She had on a More Antic Barsk & a Poplin Nubier withBerage trimmins onto it, while her ise & kurls was enuff tomake a man jump into a mill pond without biddin his relashunsgood-by.  I pittid the Octoroon from the inmost recusses of myhart & hawled out 50 dollars kerslap, & told her to buy her oldmuther as soon as posserbul.  Sez she "kine sir mutch thanks."She then lade her hed over onto my showlder & sed I was "oldrats."  I was astonished to heer this obsarvation, which Iknowd was never used in refined society & I perlitely butemfattercly shovd her hed away.Sez I "Marm, I'm trooly sirprized."Sez she, "git out.  Yure the nicist old man Ive seen yit.  Giveus anuther 50!"  Had a seleck assortment of the most tremenjiousthunderbolts descended down onto me I couldn't hav bin moretakin aback.  I jumpt up, but she ceased my coat tales & in awild voise cride, "No, Ile never desart you--let us fli togetherto a furrin shoor!"Sez I, "not mutch we wont," and I made a powerful effort to getawa from her.  "This is plade out," I sed, whereupon she jerktme back into the seet.  "Leggo my coat, you scandaluss female,"I roared, when she set up the most unarthly yellin and hollerinyou ever heerd.  The passinjers & the gentlemunly konducterrusht to the spot, & I don't think I ever experiunsed sich arumpus in the hull coarse of my natral dase.  The man in blackclose rusht up to me & sed "How dair yu insult my neece, youhorey heded vagabone.  You base exhibbiter of low wax figgers--yu woolf in sheep's close," & sow 4th.I was konfoozed.  I was a loonytick fur the time bein, andoffered 5 dollars reward to enny gentleman of good morrulcarracter who wood tell me whot my name was & what town I livdinto.  The konducter kum to me & sed the insultid parties woodsettle for 50 dollars, which I immejitly hawled out, & aganeimplored sumbuddy to state whare I was prinsipully, & if Ishood be thare a grate while my self ef things went on asthey'd bin goin fur sum time back.  I then axed if there wasenny more Octoroons present, "becawz," sez I, "ef there is, letum cum along, fur Ime in the Octoroon bizniss."  I then threwmy specterculs out of the winder, smasht my hat wildly downover my Ise, larfed highsterically & fell under a seet.  I laythere sum time & fell asleep.  I dreamt Mrs. Ward & the twinshad bin carried orf by Ryenosserhosses & that Baldinsville hadbin captered by a army of Octoroons.  When I awoked the lampswas a burnin dimly.  Sum of the passinjers was a snorein likepawpusses & the little damsell in the pinc gown was a singin"Oft in the Silly nite."  The onprinsipuld Octoroon & themiserbul man in black close was gone, & all of a suddent itflasht ore my brane that I'de bin swindild.1.9.  EXPERIENCE AS AN EDITOR.In the Ortum of 18-- my frend, the editor of the BaldinsvilleBugle, was obleged to leave perfeshernal dooties & go & dig histaters, & he axed me to edit for him dooring his absence.Accordingly I ground up his Shears and commenced.  It didn'ttake me a grate while to slash out copy enuff from the xchanges(Perhaps five per cent. of the Western newspapers is originalmatter relating to the immediate neighborhood, the rest iscomposed of "telegraphs" and clippings from the "exchanges"--ageneral term applied to those papers posted in exchange forothers, the accommodation being a mutual benefit.) for oneissoo, and I thawt I'd ride up to the next town on a littleJaunt, to rest my Branes, which had bin severely rackt by mymental efforts.  (This is sorter Ironical.)  So I went over tothe Rale Road offiss and axed the Sooprintendent for a pars."YOU a editer?" he axed, evijently on the pint of snickerin."Yes Sir," sez I; "don't I look poor enuff?""Just about," sed he, "but our Road can't pars you.""Can't, hay?""No Sir--it can't.""Becauz," sez I, lookin him full in the face with a Eagle eye,"IT GOES SO DARNED SLOW IT CAN'T PARS ANYBODY!"  Methinks I hadhim thar.  It's the slowest Rale Road in the West.  With amortified air, he told me to git out of his offiss.  I pittidhim and went.1.10.  OBERLIN.About two years ago I arrove in Oberlin, Ohio.  Oberlin iswhare the celebrated college is.  In fack, Oberlin IS thecollege, everything else in that air vicinity resolvin aroundexcloosivly for the benefit of that institution.  It is a verygood college, too, & a grate many wurthy yung men go thereannooally to git intelleck into 'em.  But its my onbiassed'pinion that they go it rather too strong on Ethiopians atOberlin.  But that's nun of my bisniss.  I'm into the Showbizness.  Yit as a faithful historan I must menshun the fackthat on rainy dase white peple can't find their way threw thestreets without the gas is lit, there bein such a numerosity ofcullerd pussons in the town.As I was sayin, I arroved at Oberlin, and called on PerfesserPeck for the purpuss of skewerin Kolonial Hall to exhibit mywax works and beests of Pray into.  Kolonial Hall is in thecollege and is used by the stujents to speak peaces and readessays into.Sez Perfesser Peck, "Mister Ward, I don't know 'bout thisbizniss.  What are your sentiments?"Sez I, "I hain't got any.""Good God!" cried the Perfesser, "did I understan you to sayyou hav no sentiments!""Nary a sentiment!" sez I."Mister Ward, don't your blud bile at the thawt that threemillion and a half of your culled brethren air a clankin theirchains in the South?"Sez I, "Not a bile!  Let 'em clank!"He was about to continner his flowry speech when I put astopper on him.  Sez I, "Perfesser Peck, A. Ward is my name &Americky is my nashun; I'm allers the same, tho' humble is mystation, and I've bin in the show bizniss goin on 22 years.The pint is, can I hav your Hall by payin a fair price?  Youair full of sentiments.  That's your lay, while I'm a exhibiterof startlin curiosities.  What d'ye say?""Mister Ward, you air endowed with a hily practical mind, andwhile I deeply regret that you air devoid of sentiments I'lllet you hav the hall provided your exhibition is of a moral &elevatin nater."Sez I, "Tain't nothin shorter."So I opened in Kolonial Hall, which was crowded every nite withstujents, &c.  Perfesser Finny gazed for hours at my Kangaroo,but when that sagashus but onprincipled little cuss set up oneof his onarthly yellins and I proceeded to hosswhip him, thePerfesser objected.  "Suffer not your angry pashums to rise upat the poor annimil's little excentrissities," said thePerfesser."Do you call such conduck as THOSE a little excentrissity?" Iaxed."I do," sed he; sayin which he walked up to the cage and sezhe, "let's try moral swashun upon the poor creeter."  So he puthis hand upon the Kangeroo's hed and sed, "poor little fellow--poor little fellow--your master is very crooil, isn't he, myuntootered frend," when the Kangaroo, with a terrific yell,grabd the Perfesser by the hand and cum very near chawin itorf.  It was amoozin to see the Perfesser jump up and screamwith pane.  Sez I, "that's one of the poor little fellow'sexcentrissities!"Sez he, "Mister Ward, that's a dangerous quadruped.  He'stotally depraved. I will retire and do my lasserated hand up ina rag, and meanwhile I request you to meat out summery andsevere punishment to the vishus beest," I hosswhipt the littlecuss for upwards of 15 minutes.  Guess I licked sum of hisexcentrissity out of him.Oberlin is a grate plase.  The College opens with a prayer andthen the New York Tribune is read.  A kolleckshun is then takenup to buy overkoats with red horn buttons onto them for theindignant cullured people of Kanady.  I have to contribitlibrally two the glowrius work, as they kawl it hear.  I'mkompelled by the Fackulty to reserve front seets in my show forthe cullered peple.  At the Boardin House the cullered peplesit at the first table.  What they leeve is maid into hash forthe white peple.  As I don't like the idee of eatin my vittleswith Ethiopians, I sit at the seckind table, and thekonsequence is I've devowered so much hash that my inards is ina hily mixt up condishun.  Fish bones hav maid their appearanceall over my boddy and pertater peelins air a springin upthrough my hair.  Howsever I don't mind it.  I'm gittin alongwell in a pecunery pint of view.  The College has konfired uponme the honery title of T.K., of which I'm suffishuntly prowd.1.11.  THE SHOWMAN'S COURTSHIP.Thare was many affectin ties which made me hanker arter BetsyJane.  Her father's farm jined our'n; their cows and our'nsquencht their thurst at the same spring; our old mares bothhad stars in their forreds; the measles broke out in bothfamerlies at nearly the same period; our parients (Betsy's andmine) slept reglarly every Sunday in the same meetin house, andthe nabers used to obsarve, "How thick the Wards and Peasleysair!"  It was a surblime site, in the Spring of the year, tosee our sevral mothers (Betsy's and mine) with their gownspin'd up so thay couldn't sile 'em, affecshuntly Bilin sopetogether & aboozin the nabers.Altho I hankerd intensly arter the objeck of my affecshuns, Idarsunt tell her of the fires which was rajin in my manlyBuzzum.  I'd try to do it but my tung would kerwollup up aginthe roof of my mowth & stick thar, like deth to a deseastAfrikan or a country postmaster to his offiss, while my hartwhanged agin my ribs like a old fashioned wheat Flale agin abarn floor.'Twas a carm still nite in Joon.  All nater was husht and narya zeffer disturbed the sereen silens.  I sot with Betsy Jane onthe fense of her farther's pastur.  We'd bin rompin threw thewoods, kullin flours & drivin the woodchuck from his Nativ Lair(so to speak) with long sticks.  Wall, we sot thar on thefense, a swingin our feet two and fro, blushin as red as theBaldinsville skool house when it was fust painted, and lookinvery simple, I make no doubt.  My left arm was ockepied inballunsin myself on the fense, while my rite was woundidluvinly round her waste.I cleared my throat and tremblin sed, "Betsy, you're aGazelle."I thought that air was putty fine.  I waitid to see what effeckit would hav upon her.  It evidently didn't fetch her, for sheup and sed,"You're a sheep!"Sez I, "Betsy, I think very muchly of you.""I don't b'leeve a word you say--so there now cum!" with whichobsarvashun she hitched away from me."I wish thar was winders to my Sole," sed I, "so that you couldsee some of my feelins.  There's fire enuff in here," sed I,strikin my buzzum with my fist, "to bile all the corn beef andturnips in the naberhood.  Versoovius and the Critter ain't acircumstans!"She bowd her hed down and commenst chawin the strings to hersun bonnet."Ar could you know the sleeplis nites I worry threw with onyour account, how vittles has seized to be attractiv to me &how my lims has shrunk up, you wouldn't dowt me.  Gase on thiswastin form and these 'ere sunken cheeks"--I should have continnered on in this strane probly for sumtime, but unfortnitly I lost my ballunse and fell over into thepastur ker smash, tearin my close and seveerly damagin myselfginerally.Betsy Jane sprung to my assistance in dubble quick time anddragged me 4th.  Then drawin herself up to her full hite shesed:"I won't listen to your noncents no longer.  Jes say ritestrate out what you're drivin at.  If you mean gettin hitched,I'M IN!"I considered that air enuff for all practicul purpusses, and weproceeded immejitely to the parson's, & was made 1 that verynite.(Notiss to the Printer:  Put some stars here.)        *        *        *        *        *        *I've parst threw many tryin ordeels sins then, but Betsy Janehas bin troo as steel.  By attendin strickly to bizniss I'veamarsed a handsum Pittance. No man on this footstool can rise &git up & say I ever knowinly injered no man or wimmin folks,while all agree that my Show is ekalled by few and exceld bynone, embracin as it does a wonderful colleckshun of livin wildBeests of Pray, snaix in grate profushun, a endliss variety oflife-size wax figgers, & the only traned kangaroo in Ameriky--the most amoozin little cuss ever introjuced to a discriminatinpublic.1.12.  THE CRISIS.[This Oration was delivered before the commencement of thewar.]On returnin to my humsted in Baldinsville, Injianny, resuntly,my feller sitterzens extended a invite for me to norate to 'emon the Krysis.  I excepted & on larst Toosday nite I peared be4a C of upturned faces in the Red Skool House.  I spoke nearlyas follers:Baldinsvillins:  Hearto4, as I hav numerously obsarved, I haveabstrained from having any sentimunts or principles, mypollertics, like my religion, bein of a exceedin accommodatincharacter.  But the fack can't be no longer disgised that aKrysis is onto us, & I feel it's my dooty to accept your invitefor one consecutive nite only.  I spose the inflammertoryindividooals who assisted in projucing this Krysis know whatgood she will do, but I ain't 'shamed to state that I don'tscacely.  But the Krysis is hear.  She's bin hear for sevralweeks, & Goodness nose how long she'll stay.  But I venter toassert that she's rippin things.  She's knockt trade into acockt up hat and chaned Bizness of all kinds tighter nor I everchaned any of my livin wild Beests.  Alow me to hear dygress &stait that my Beests at presnt is as harmless as the newbornBabe.  Ladys & gentlemen needn't hav no fears on that pint.  Toresoom--Altho I can't exactly see what good this Krysis can do,I can very quick say what the origernal cawz of her is.  Theorigernal cawz is Our Afrikan Brother.  I was into BARNIM'SMoozeum down to New York the other day & saw that exsentricEtheopian, the What Is It.  Sez I, "Mister What Is It, youfolks air raisin thunder with this grate country.  You'regettin to be ruther more numeris than interestin.  It is a pityyou coodent go orf sumwhares by yourselves, & be a nation ofWhat Is Its, tho' if you'll excoose me, I shooden't care aboutmarryin among you.  No dowt you're exceedin charmin to hum, butyour stile of luvliness isn't adapted to this cold climit.  Helarfed into my face, which rather Riled me, as I had beenperfeckly virtoous and respectable in my observashuns.  So sezI, turnin a leetle red in the face, I spect, "Do you hav theunblushin impoodents to say you folks haven't raised a big messof thunder in this brite land, Mister What Is It?"  He larfedagin, wusser nor be4, whareupon I up and sez, "Go home, Sir, toAfriky's burnin shores & taik all the other What Is Its alongwith you.  Don't think we can spair your interestin picters.You What Is Its air on the pint of smashin up the gratestGuv'ment ever erected by man, & you actooally hav the owdassityto larf about it.  Go home, you low cuss!"I was workt up to a high pitch, & I proceeded to a Restorator &cooled orf with some little fishes biled in ile--I b'leeve thaycall 'em sardeens.Feller Sitterzuns, the Afrikan may be Our Brother.  Sevral hilyrespectyble gentlemen, and sum talentid females tell us so, &fur argyment's sake I mite be injooced to grant it, tho' Idon't beleeve it myself.  But the Afrikan isn't our sister &our wife & our uncle.  He isn't sevral of our brothers & allour fust wife's relashuns.  He isn't our grandfather, and ourgrate grandfather, and our Aunt in the country.  Scacely.  &yit numeris persons would have us think so.  It's troo he runsCongress & sevral other public grosserys, but then he ain'teverybody & everybody else likewise.  [Notiss to bizness men ofVANITY FAIR:  Extry charg fur this larst remark.  It's a goak.--A.W.]But we've got the Afrikan, or ruther he's got us, & now whatair we going to do about it?  He's a orful noosanse.  Praps heisn't to blame fur it.  Praps he was creatid fur sum wisepurpuss, like the measles and New Englan Rum, but it's mityhard to see it.  At any rate he's no good here, & as I statidto Mister What Is It, it's a pity he cooden't go orf sumwharesquietly by hisself, whare he cood wear red weskits & speckledneckties, & gratterfy his ambishun in varis interestin wase,without havin a eternal fuss kickt up about him.Praps I'm bearin down too hard upon Cuffy.  Cum to think on it,I am.  He woodn't be sich a infernal noosanse if white peplewould let him alone.  He mite indeed be interestin.  And now Ithink of it, why can't the white peple let him alone.  What'sthe good of continnerly stirrin him up with a ten-foot pole?He isn't the sweetest kind of Perfoomery when in a natralstait.Feller Sitterzens, the Union's in danger.  The black devilDisunion is trooly here, starein us all squarely in the face!We must drive him back.  Shall we make a 2nd Mexico ofourselves?  Shall we sell our birthrite for a mess of potash?Shall one brother put the knife to the throat of anutherbrother?  Shall we mix our whisky with each other's blud?Shall the star spangled Banner be cut up into dishcloths?Standin here in this here Skoolhouse, upon my nativ shor so tospeak, I anser--Nary!Oh you fellers who air raisin this row, & who in the fust placestartid it, I'm 'shamed of you.  The Showman blushes for you,from his boots to the topmost hair upon his wenerable hed.Feller Sitterzens:  I am in the Sheer & Yeller leaf.  I shallpeg out 1 of these dase.  But while I do stop here I shall stayin the Union.  I know not what the supervizers of Baldinsvillemay conclude to do, but for one, I shall stand by the Stars &Stripes.  Under no circumstances whatsomever will I sesesh.Let every Stait in the Union sesesh & let Palmetter flags flotethicker nor shirts on Square Baxter's close line, still will Istick to the good old flag.  The country may go to the devil,but I won't!  And next Summer when I start out on my campanewith my Show, wharever I pitch my little tent, you shall seefloatin prowdly from the center pole thereof the Amerikan Flag,with nary a star wiped out, nary a stripe less, but the sameold flag that has allers flotid thar! & the price of admishunwill be the same it allers was--15 cents, children half price.Feller Sitterzens, I am dun.  Accordinly I squatted.1.13.  WAX FIGURES VS. SHAKESPEARE.ONTO THE WING--1859.Mr. Editor.I take my Pen in hand to inform yu that I'm in good helth andtrust these few lines will find yu injoyin the same blessins.I wood also state that I'm now on the summir kampane.  As thePoit sez--               ime erflote, ime erflote               On the Swift rollin tied                An the Rovir is free.Bizness is scacely middlin, but Sirs I manige to pay for myfoode and raiment puncktooally and without no grumblin.  Thebarked arrers of slandur has bin leviled at the undersinedmoren onct sins heze bin into the show bizness, but I make boldto say no man on this footstule kan troothfully say I everronged him or eny of his folks.  I'm travelin with a tent,which is better nor hirin hauls.  My show konsists of a seriousof wax works, snakes, a paneramy kalled a Grand Movin Diarea ofthe War in the Crymear, komic songs and the Cangeroo, whichlarst little cuss continners to konduct hisself in the mostoutrajus stile.  I started out with the idear of makin my showa grate Moral Entertainment, but I'm kompeled to sware so muchat that air infurnal Kangeroo that I'm frade this desine willbe flustratid to some extent.  And while speakin of morrality,remines me that sum folks turn up their nosis at shows likemine, sayin they is low and not fit to be patrernized bypeplpeple of high degree.  Sirs, I manetane that this isinfernul nonsense.  I manetane that wax figgers is moreelevatin than awl the plays ever wroten.  Take Shakespeer forinstunse.  Peple think heze grate things, but I kontend hezequite the reverse to the kontrary.  What sort of sense is thareto King Leer, who goze round cussin his darters, chawin hay andthroin straw at folks, and larfin like a silly old koot andmakin a ass of hisself ginerally?  Thare's Mrs. Mackbeth--shezea nise kind of woomon to have round ain't she, a puttin oldMack, her husband, up to slayin Dunkan with a cheeze knife,while heze payin a frendly visit to their house.  O its hilymorral, I spoze, when she larfs wildly and sez, "gin me thedaggurs--Ile let his bowels out," or wurds to that effeck--Isay, this is awl, strickly, propper I spoze?  That JackFawlstarf is likewise a immoral old cuss, take him how ye may,and Hamlick is as crazy as a loon.  Thare's Richurd the Three,peple think heze grate things, but I look upon him in the liteof a monkster.  He kills everybody he takes a noshun to in koldblud, and then goze to sleep in his tent.  Bimeby he wakes upand yells for a hoss so he kan go orf and kill some more peple.If he isent a fit spesserman for the gallers then I shood liketo know whare you find um.  Thare's Iargo who is more ornerynor pizun.  See how shameful he treated that hily respecterbleinjun gentlemun, Mister Otheller, makin him for to beleeve hiswife was too thick with Casheo.  Obsarve how Iargo got Casheodrunk as a biled owl on corn whiskey in order to karry out hissneekin desines.  See how he wurks Mister Otheller's feelins upso that he goze and makes poor Desdemony swaller a piller whichcawses her deth.  But I must stop.  At sum futur time I shallcontinner my remarks on the drammer in which I shall show thevarst supeeriority of wax figgers and snakes over theaterplays, in a interlectooal pint of view.Very Respectively yures,                                            A WARD, T.K.1.14.  AMONG THE FREE LOVERS.  (Some queer people, callingthemselves "Free Lovers," and possessing very original ideasabout life and morality, established themselves at BerlinHeights, in Ohio, a few years since.  Public opinion wasresistlessly against them, however, and the association wassoon disbanded.)Some years ago I pitched my tent and onfurled my banner to thebreeze, in Berlin Hites, Ohio.  I had hearn that Berlin Hiteswas ockepied by a extensive seck called Free Lovers, whobeleeved in affinertys and sich, goin back on their domesticties without no hesitation whatsomever.  They was likewisespirit rappers and high presher reformers on gineralprinciples.  If I can improve these 'ere misgided peple byshowin them my onparalleld show at the usual low price ofadmitants, methunk, I shell not hav lived in vane.  Butbitterly did I cuss the day I ever sot foot in the retchidplace.  I sot up my tent in a field near the Love Cure, as theycalled it, and bimeby the free lovers begun for to congregatearound the door.  A onreer set I have never sawn.  The men'sfaces was all covered with hare and they lookt half-starved todeth.  They didn't wear no weskuts for the purpose (as theysed) of allowin the free air of hevun to blow onto theirboozums.  Their pockets was filled with tracks and pamplits andthey was bare-footed.  They sed the Postles didn't wear boots,& why should they?  That was their stile of argyment.  Thewimin was wuss than the men.  They wore trowsis, short gownds,straw hats with green ribbins, and all carried bloo cottonumbrellers.Presently a perfeckly orful lookin female presented herself atthe door.  Her gownd was skanderlusly short and her trowsis wasshameful to behold.She eyed me over very sharp, and then startin back she sed, ina wild voice:"Ah, can it be?""Which?" sed I."Yes, 'tis troo, O 'tis troo!""15 cents, marm," I anserd.She bust out a cryin & sed:"And so I hav found you at larst--at larst, O at larst!""Yes," I anserd, "you hav found me at larst, and you would havfound me at fust, if you had cum sooner."She grabd me vilently by the coat collar, and brandishin herumbreller wildly round, exclaimed:"Air you a man?"Sez I, "I think I air, but if you doubt it, you can addressMrs. A. Ward, Baldinsville, Injianny, postage pade, & she willprobly giv you the desired informashun.""Then thou ist what the cold world calls marrid?""Madam, I istest!"The exsentric female then clutched me franticly by the arm andhollered:"You air mine, O you air mine!""Scacely," I sed, endeverin to git loose from her.  But sheclung to me and sed:"You air my Affinerty!""What upon arth is that?" I shouted."Dost thou not know?""No, I dostent!""Listin man, & I'll tell ye!" sed the strange female; "foryears I hav yearned for thee.  I knowd thou wast in the world,sumwhares, tho I didn't know whare.  My hart sed he would cumand I took courage.  He HAS cum--he's here--you air him--youair my Affinerty!  O 'tis too mutch! too mutch!" and she sobbedagin."Yes," I anserd, "I think it is a darn site too mutch!""Hast thou not yearned for me?" she yelled, ringin her handslike a female play acter."Not a yearn!" I bellerd at the top of my voice, throwin heraway from me.The free lovers who was standin round obsarvin the scenecommenst for to holler "shame" "beast," etsettery, etsettery.I was very mutch riled, and fortifyin myself with a spare tentstake, I addrest them as follers:  "You pussylanermus critters,go way from me and take this retchid woman with you.  I'm alaw-abidin man, and beleeve in good, old-fashioned institutions.I am marrid & my orfsprings resemble me if I am a showman!  Ithink your Affinity bizniss is cussed noncents, besides beinoutrajusly wicked.  Why don't you behave desunt like otherfolks?  Go to work and earn a honist livin and not stay roundhere in this lazy, shiftless way, pizenin the moral atmospherewith your pestifrous ideas!  You wimin folks go back to yourlawful husbands if you've got any, and take orf them skanderlousgownds and trowsis, and dress respectful like other wimin.  Youmen folks, cut orf them pirattercal whiskers, burn up theminfurnel pamplits, put sum weskuts on, go to work choppin wood,splittin fence rales, or tillin the sile."  I pored 4th myindignashun in this way till I got out of breth, when I stopt.I shant go to Berlin Hites agin, not if I live to be as oldas Methooseler.1.15.  A VISIT TO BRIGHAM YOUNG.It is now goin on 2 (too) yeres, as I very well remember, sinceI crossed the Planes for Kaliforny, the Brite land of Jold.While crossin the Planes all so bold I fell in with sum noblered men of the forest (N.B.  This is rote Sarcasticul.  Injinsis Pizin, whar ever found,) which thay Sed I was their Brother,& wanted for to smoke the Calomel of Peace with me.  Thay thenstole my jerkt beef, blankits, etsettery, skalpt my orgingrinder & scooted with a Wild Hoop.  Durin the Cheaf's techinspeech he sed he shood meet me in the Happy Huntin Grounds.  Ifhe duz thare will be a fite.  But enuff of this ere.  "RevenNoose Muttons," as our skoolmaster, who has got Talent intohim, cussycally obsarve.I arrove at Salt Lake in doo time.  At Camp Scott there was alot of U.S. sogers, hosstensibly sent out there to smash theMormons but really to eat Salt vittles & play poker & otherbeautiful but sumwhat onsartin games.  I got acquainted withsum of the officers.  Thay lookt putty scrumpshus in theirBloo coats with brass buttings onto um & ware very talenteddrinkers, but so fur as fitin is consarned I'd willingly put mywax figgers agin the hull party.My desire was to exhibit my grate show in Salt Lake City, so Icalled on Brigham Yung, the grate mogull amung the mormins andaxed his permishun to pitch my tent and onfurl my banner to thejentle breezis.  He lookt at me in a austeer manner for a fewminits, and sed:"Do you bleeve in Solomon, Saint Paul, the immaculateness ofthe Mormin Church and the Latter-day Revelashuns?"Sez I, "I'm on it!"  I make it a pint to git along plesunt, thoI didn't know what under the Son the old feller was drivin at.He sed I mite show."You air a marrid man, Mister Yung, I bleeve?" sez I, preparinto rite him sum free parsis."I hev eighty wives, Mister Ward.  I sertinly am married.""How do you like it as far as you hev got?" sed I.He sed "middlin," and axed me wouldn't I like to see hisfamerly, to which I replide that I wouldn't mine minglin withthe fair Seck & Barskin in the winnin smiles of his interestinwives.  He accordingly tuk me to his Scareum.  The house ispowerful big & in a exceedin large room was his wives &children, which larst was squawkin and hollerin enuff to takethe roof rite orf the house.  The wimin was of all sizes andages.  Sum was pretty & sum was Plane--sum was helthy and sumwas on the Wayne--which is verses, tho sich was not myintentions, as I don't 'prove of puttin verses in Prozerittins, tho ef occashun requires I can Jerk a Poim ekal to anyof them Atlantic Munthly fellers."My wives, Mister Ward," sed Yung."Your sarvant, marms," sed I, as I sot down in a cheer which ared-heded female brawt me."Besides these wives you see here, Mister Ward," sed Yung, "Ihav eighty more in varis parts of this consecrated land whichair Sealed to me.""Which?" sez I, gittin up & starin at him."Sealed, Sir! sealed.""Whare bowts?" sez I."I sed, Sir, that they was sealed!"  He spoke in a traggerdyvoice."Will they probly continner on in that stile to any grateextent, Sir?" I axed."Sir," sed he, turnin as red as a biled beet, "don't you knowthat the rules of our Church is that I, the Profit, may hev asmeny wives as I wants?""Jes so," I sed.  "You are old pie, ain't you?""Them as is Sealed to me--that is to say, to be mine when Iwants um--air at present my sperretooul wives," sed MisterYung."Long may thay wave!" sez I, seein I shood git into a scrape efI didn't look out.In a privit conversashun with Brigham I learnt the follerinfax:  It takes him six weeks to kiss his wives.  He don't do itonly onct a yere & sez it is wuss nor cleanin house.  He don'tpretend to know his children, thare is so many of um, tho theyall know him.  He sez about every child he meats call him Par,& he takes it for grantid it is so.  His wives air veryexpensiv.  Thay allers want suthin & ef he don't buy it for umthay set the house in a uproar.  He sez he don't have a minit'speace.  His wives fite amung their selves so much that he hasbilt a fitin room for thare speshul benefit, & when too of 'emget into a row he has em turnd loose into that place, whare thedispoot is settled accordin to the rules of the London prizering.  Sum times thay abooz hisself individooally.  Thay hevpulled the most of his hair out at the roots & he wares meny ahorrible scar upon his body, inflicted with mop-handles,broom-sticks, and sich.  Occashunly they git mad & scald himwith bilin hot water.  When he got eny waze cranky thay'd shuthim up in a dark closit, previsly whippin him arter the stileof muthers when thare orfsprings git onruly.  Sumptimes when hewent in swimmin thay'd go to the banks of the Lake & steal allhis close, thereby compellin him to sneek home by a sircootiusrowt, drest in the Skanderlus stile of the Greek Slaiv.  "Ifind that the keers of a marrid life way hevy onto me," sed theProfit, "& sumtimes I wish I'd remaned singel."  I left theProfit and startid for the tavern whare I put up to.  On my wayI was overtuk by a lurge krowd of Mormons, which theysurroundid me & statid that they were goin into the Show free."Wall," sez I, "ef I find a individooal who is goin roundlettin folks into his show free, I'll let you know.""We've had a Revelashun biddin us go into A. Wards's Showwithout payin nothin!" thay showtid."Yes," hollered a lot of femaile Mormonesses, ceasin me by thecote tales & swingin me round very rapid, "we're all goin infree!  So sez the Revelashun!""What's Old Revelashun got to do with my show?" sez I, gittinputty rily.  "Tell Mister Revelashun," sed I, drawin myself upto my full hite and lookin round upon the ornery krowd with aprowd & defiant mean, "tell Mister Revelashun to mind his ownbizness, subject only to the Konstitushun of the UnitedStates!""Oh now let us in, that's a sweet man," sed several femails,puttin thare arms round me in luvin style.  "Become 1 of us.Becum a Preest & hav wives Sealed to you.""Not a Seal!" sez I, startin back in horror at the idee."Oh stay, Sir, stay," sed a tell, gawnt femaile, ore whoos hed37 summirs must hev parsd, "stay, & I'll be your JentleGazelle.""Not ef I know it, you won't," sez I. "Awa you skanderlusfemaile, awa!  Go & be a Nunnery!"  THAT'S WHAT I SED, JES SO."& I," sed a fat chunky femaile, who must hev wade more thantoo hundred lbs, "I will be your sweet gidin Star!"Sez I, "Ile bet two dollers and a half you won't!"  Whare ear Imay Rome Ile still be troo 2 thee, Oh Betsy Jane!  [N.B. BetsyJane is my wife's Sir naime.]"Wiltist thou not tarry here in the promist Land?" sed severalof the miserabil critters."Ile see you all essenshally cussed be4 I wiltist!" roared I,as mad as I cood be at thare infernul noncents.  I girdid up myLions & fled the Seen.  I packt up my duds & Left Salt Lake,which is a 2nd Soddum & Germorrer, inhabitid by as theavin &onprincipled a set of retchis as ever drew Breth in eny spot onthe Globe.1.16.  SCANDALOUS DOINGS AT PITTSBURG.Hear in the Buzzum of my famerly I am enjoyin myself, at peaswith awl mankind and the wimin folks likewise.  I go down tothe villige ockashunly and take a little old Rye fur thestummuck's sake, but I avoyd spiritus lickers as a ginralthing.  No man evir seen me intossikated but onct, and that airhappind in Pittsburg.  A parsel of ornery cusses in that luvlysity bustid inter the hawl durin the nite and aboosed my waxworks shaimful.  I didn't obsarve the outrajus transacshunsontil the next evening when the peple begun for to kongregate.Suddinly they kommensed fur to larf and holler in a boysteriousstile.  Sez I good peple what's up? Sez thay them's grate waxwurks, isn't they, old man.  I immejitly looked up ter wharethe wax works was, and my blud biles as I think of the sitewhich then met my Gase.  I hope two be dodrabbertid (Dod-rabitis an American euphemism for a profane expression which isquite as common in this country as on the other side of theAtlantic.) if them afoursed raskals hadent gone and put a oldkaved in hat onter George Washington's hed and shuved a shortblack klay pipe inter his mouth.  His noze thay had painted redand his trowsis legs thay had shuved inside his butes.  My waxfigger of Napoleon Boneypart was likewise mawltreatid.  Hissword wus danglin tween his legs, and his cockd hat was drawnklean down over his ize, and he was plased in a stoopinposishun lookin zactly as tho he was as drunk as a biled owl.Ginral Taylor was a standin on his hed and Wingfield Skott'skoat tales ware pind over his hed and his trowsis warekompleetly torn orf frum hisself.  My wax works representin theLord's Last Supper was likewise aboozed.  Three of the Postlesware under the table and two of um had on old tarpawlin hatsand raggid pee jackits and ware smokin pipes.  Judus Iskarriothad on a cocked hat and was appeerently drinkin, as a Bottle ofwhisky sot befour him.  This ere specktercal was too much furme.  I klosed the show and then drowndid my sorrers in theflowin Bole.1.17.  THE CENSUS.The Sences taker in our town bein taken sick, he deppertised meto go out for him one day, and as he was too ill to giv meinformashun how to perceed, I was consekently compelled to goit blind.  Sittin down by the road side, I drawd up thefollerin list of questions, which I proposed to ax the peple Ivisited:  Wat's your age?  Whar was you born?  Air you marrid, and if so how do you like it?  How many children hav you, and do they resemble you or your    naber?  Did you ever hav the measels, and if so how many?  Hav you a twin brother several years older than yourself?  How many parents hav you?  Do you read Watt's Hims regler?  Do you use boughten tobacker?(I.e., that which has been bought.  A very common word in theinterior of New England and New York.  It is applied toarticles purchased from the shops, to distinguish them fromarticles of home manufacture.  Many farmers make their ownsugar from the maple-tree, and their coffee from barley or rye.West India sugar or coffee is then called "boughten sugar," &c."This is a home-made carpet; that a 'boughten' one," i.e., onebought at a shop.  In the North of England, baker's bread iscalled "bought bread."  Wat's your fitin wate?  Air you trubeld with biles?  How does your meresham culler?  State whether you air blind, deaf, idiotic, or got the  heaves?  Do you know any Opry singers, and if so how much do they owe  you?  What's the average of virtoo on the Ery Canawl?  If 4 barrils of Emptins pored onto a barn floor will kiver  it, how many plase can Dion Bourcicault write in a year?[Emptyings, pronounced "emptins," the lees of beer, cider, &c.;yeast or anything by which bread is leavened:-"'Twill take more emptins, by a long chalk, than this new  party's got, To give such heavy cakes as these a start, I tell ye what."                                        "The Biglow Papers."]  Is Beans a regler article of diet in your family?  How many chickins hav you, on foot and in the shell?  Air you aware that Injianny whisky is used in New York  shootin galrys instid of pistols, and that it shoots furthest?  Was you ever at Niagry Falls?  Was you ever in the Penitentiary?  State how much pork, impendin crysis, Dutch cheeze, popler  suvrinty, standard poetry, children's strainers, slave code,  catnip, red flannel, ancient history, pickled tomaters, old  junk, perfoomery, coal ile, liberty, hoop skirt, &c., you hav  on hand?But it didn't work.  I got into a row at the fust house I stoptto, with some old maids.  Disbelieven the ansers they giv inregard to their ages, I endevered to open their mouths and lookat their teeth, same as they do with hosses, but they floo intoa vilent rage and tackled me with brooms and sich.  Takin thesences requires experiunse, like any other bizniss.1.18.  AN HONEST LIVING.I was on my way from the mines to San Francisco, with a lightpuss and a hevy hart.  You'd scacely hav recognized my fairform, so kiverd was I with dust.  Bimeby I met Old Poodles, theall-firdist gambler in the country.  He was afoot and in hisshirt-sleeves, and was in a wuss larther nor any race hoss Iever saw.  ("All-fired," enormous, excessive, a low Americanism,not improbably a puritanical corruption of "hell-fired,"designed to have the virtue of an oath without offending politeears.)"Whither goist thow, sweet nimp?" sez I, in a play-actin tone."To the mines, Sir," he unto me did say, "to the mines, TO EARNAN HONEST LIVIN."Thinks I that air aint very cool, I guess, and druv on.1.19.  THE PRESS.I want the editers to cum to my Show free as the flours of May,but I don't want um to ride a free hoss to deth.  Thare istimes when Patience seizes to be virtoous.  I had "in my mind'seye, Hurrashio" (cotashun from Hamlick) sum editers in a sertintown which shall be nameless, who air Both sneakin and ornery.They cum in krowds to my Show and then axt me ten sents a linefor Puffs.  I objectid to payin, but they sed ef I didn't downwith the dust thay'd wipe my Show from the face of the earth!Thay sed the Press was the Arkymedian Leaver which moved thewurld.  I put up to their extorshuns until thay'd bled me so Iwas a meer shadder, and left in disgust.It was in a surtin town in Virginny, the Muther of Presidents &things, that I was shaimfully aboozed by a editor in humanform.  He set my Show up steep & kalled me the urbane &gentlemunly manajer, but when I, fur the purpuss of showin fairplay all around, went to anuther offiss to git my hanbillsprinted, what duz this pussillanermus editer do but change histoon & abooze me like a Injun.  He sed my wax wurks was ahumbug & called me a horey-heded itinerent vagabone.  I thortat fust Ide pollish him orf ar-lar the Beneshy Boy, but onreflectin that he cood pollish me much wuss in his paper, I givit up.  & I wood here take occashun to advise peple when thayrun agin, as thay sumtimes will, these miserable papers, to notpay no attenshun to um.  Abuv all, don't assault a editer ofthis kind.  It only gives him a notorosity, which is jest whathe wants, & don't do you no more good than it wood to jump intoenny other mud puddle.  Editers are generally fine men, butthere must be black sheep in every flock.1.20.  EDWIN FOREST AS OTHELLO.Durin a recent visit to New York the undersined went to seeEdwin Forrest.  As I'm into the moral show bizness myself, Iginrally go to Barnum's moral Museum, where only moral pepleair admitted, pertickly on Wednesday arternoons.  But this timeI thot I'd go & see Ed.  Ed has bin actin out on the stage formany years.  There is varis 'pinions about his actin,Englishmen ginrally bleevin that he is far superior to MisterMacready; but on one pint all agree, & that is that Ed drawslike a six ox team.  Ed was actin at Niblo's Garding, whichlooks considerable more like a parster, than a garding, but letthat pars.  I sot down in the pit, took out my spectacles &commenced peroosin the evenin's bill.  The awjince was all-firedlarge & the boxes was full of the elitty of New York.  Severalopery glasses was leveld at me by Gothum's farest darters, butI didn't let on as tho I noticed it, tho mebby I did take outmy sixteen-dollar silver watch & brandish it round more than wasnecessary.  But the best of us has our weaknesses & if a man hasgewelry let him show it.  As I was peroosin the bill a graveyoung man who sot near me axed me if I'd ever seen Forrest dancethe Essence of Old Virginny?  "He's immense in that," sed theyoung man.  "He also does a fair champion jig," the young mancontinnerd, "but his Big Thing is the Essence of Old Virginny."Sez I, "Fair youth, do you know what I'd do with you if you wasmy sun?""No," sez he."Wall," sez I, "I'd appint your funeral tomorrow arternoon, &the KORPS SHOULD BE READY!  You're too smart to live on thisyearth."  He didn't try any more of his capers on me.  Butanother pussylanermus individooul, in a red vest & patentlether boots, told me his name was Bill Astor & axed me to lendhim 50 cents till early in the mornin.  I told him I'd problysend it round to him before he retired to his virtoous couch,but if I didn't he might look for it next fall, as soon as Icut my corn.  The Orchestry was now fiddling with all theirmight, & as the peple didn't understan anything about it theyapplaudid versifrussly.  Presently, Old Ed cum out.  The playwas Otheller or More of Veniss.  Otheller was writ by Wm.Shakspeer.  The scene is laid in Veniss.  Otheller was a likelyman & was a ginral in the Veniss army.  He eloped with Desdemony,a darter of the Hon. Mister Brabantio, who represented one ofthe back districks in the Veneshun legislater.  Old Brabantiowas as mad as thunder at this & tore round considerable, butfinally cooled down, tellin Otheller, howsever, that Desdemonyhad come it over her Par, & that he had better look out orshe'd come it over him likewise.  Mr. & Mrs. Otheller git alongvery comfortable like for a spell.  She is sweet-tempered andluvin--a nice, sensible female, never goin in for he-femaleconventions, green cotton umbrellers, and pickled beats.Otheller is a good provider and thinks all the world of hiswife.  She has a lazy time of it, the hired girl doin all thecookin and washin.  Desdemony, in fact, don't have to git thewater to wash her own hands with.  But a low cuss named Iago,who I bleeve wants to git Otheller out of his snug governmentbirth, now goes to work & upsets the Otheller family in themost outrajus stile.  Iago falls in with a brainless youthnamed Roderigo & wins all his money at poker.  (Iago allersplayed foul.)  He thus got money enuff to carry out hisonprincipled skeem.  Mike Cassio, a Irishman, is selected as atool by Iago.  Mike was a clever feller & orficer in Otheller'sarmy.  He liked his tods too well, howsever, & they flooredhim, as they have many other promisin young men. Iago injucesMike to drink with him, Iago slyly throwin his whiskey over hisshoulder.  Mike gits as drunk as a biled owl & allows that hecan lick a yard full of the Veneshun fancy before breakfast,without sweatin a hair. He meets Roderigo & proceeds for tosmash him.  A feller named Montano undertakes to slap Cassio,when that infatooated person runs his sword into him.  Thatmiserble man, Iago, pretents to be very sorry to see Mikeconduck hisself in this way & undertakes to smooth the thingover to Otheller, who rushes in with a drawn sword & wants toknow what's up.  Iago cunningly tells his story, & Othellertells Mike that he thinks a good deal of him, but he can'ttrain no more in his regiment.  Desdemony sympathizes with poorMike & interceeds for him with Otheller.  Iago makes him bleeveshe does this because she thinks more of Mike than she does ofhisself.  Otheller swallers Iago's lyin tail & goes to makin anoosence of hisself ginrally.  He worries poor Desdemonyterrible by his vile insinuations, & finally smothers her todeth with a piller.  Mrs. Iago cums in just as Otheller hasfinished the fowl deed & givs him fits right & left, showin himthat he has bin orfully gulled by her miserble cuss of ahusband.  Iago cums in, & his wife commences rakin him downalso, when he stabs her.  Otheller jaws him a spell & then cutsa small hole in his stummick with his sword.  Iago pints toDesdemony's deth bed & goes orf with a sardonic smile onto hiscountenance.  Otheller tells the peple that he has dun thestate sum service & they know it; axes them to do as fair athing as they can for him under the circumstances, & killshisself with a fish-knife, which is the most sensible thing hecan do.  This is a breef skedule of the synopsis of the play.Edwin Forrest is a grate acter.  I thot I saw Otheller beforeme all the time he was actin, & when the curtin fell, I foundmy spectacles was still mistened with salt-water, which had runfrom my eyes while poor Desdemony was dyin.  Betsy Jane--BetsyJane! let us pray that our domestic bliss may never be bustedup by a Iago!Edwin Forrest makes money actin out on the stage.  He gitsfive-hundred dollars a nite & his board & washin.  I wish I hadsuch a Forrest in my Garding!1.21.  THE SHOW BUSINESS AND POPULAR LECTURES.I feel that the Show Bizniss, which Ive stroven to ornyment, isbein usurpt by Poplar Lecturs, as thay air kalled, tho in mypinion thay air poplar humbugs.  Individoouls, who git hard up,embark in the lecturin biznis.  They cram theirselves withhi-sounding frazis, frizzle up their hare, git trustid for a sootof black close & cum out to lectur at 50 dollers a pop.  Thayaint over stockt with branes, but thay hav brass enuff to makesuffishunt kittles to bile all the sope that will be requiredby the ensooin sixteen ginerashuns.  Peple flock to heer um inkrowds.  The men go becawz its poplar & the wimin folks go tosee what other wimin folks have on.  When its over the lecturergoze & ragales hisself with oysters and sich, while the peplesay, "What a charmin lectur that air was," etsettery,etsettery, when 9 out of 10 of um don't have no moore idee ofwhat the lecturer sed than my kangeroo has of the sevunth speerof hevun.  Thare's moore infurmashun to be gut out of a wellconductid noospaper--price 3 sents--than thare is out of tenpoplar lectures at 25 or 50 dollers a pop, as the kase may be.These same peple, bare in mind, stick up their nosis at moralwax figgers & sagashus beests.  Thay say these things is low.Gents, it greeves my hart in my old age, when I'm in "the Sheer& yeller leef" (to cote frum my Irish frend Mister McBeth) tosee that the Show biznis is pritty much plade out; howsomever Ishall chance it agane in the Spring.1.22.  WOMAN'S RIGHTS.I pitcht my tent in a small town in Injianny one day lastseeson, & while I was standin at the dore takin money, adeppytashun of ladies came up & sed they wos members of theBunkumville Female Moral Reformin & Wimin's Rite's Associashun,and thay axed me if they cood go in without payin."Not exactly," sez I, "but you can pay without goin in.""Dew you know who we air?" sed one of the wimin--a tall andferoshus lookin critter, with a blew kotton umbreller under herarm--"do you know who we air, Sir?""My impreshun is," sed I, "from a kersery view, that you airfemales.""We air, Sur," sed the feroshus woman--"we belong to a Societywhitch beleeves wimin has rites--whitch beleeves in razin herto her proper speer--whitch beleeves she is indowed with asmuch intelleck as man is--whitch beleeves she is trampled onand aboozed--& who will resist henso4th & forever theincroachments of proud & domineering men."Durin her discourse, the exsentric female grabed me by thecoat-kollor & was swinging her umbreller wildly over my hed."I hope, marm," sez I, starting back, "that your intensions ishonorable!  I'm a lone man hear in a strange place.  Besides,I've a wife to hum.""Yes," cried the female, "& she's a slave!  Doth she neverdream of freedom--doth she never think of throwin off the yokeof tyrrinny & thinkin & votin for herself?--Doth she neverthink of these here things?""Not bein a natral born fool," sed I, by this time a littleriled, "I kin safely say that she dothunt.""Oh whot--whot!" screamed the female, swingin her umbreller inthe air.--"O, what is the price that woman pays for herexpeeriunce!""I don't know," sez I; "the price of my show is 15 cents purindividooal.""& can't our Soisety go in free?" asked the female."Not if I know it," sed I."Crooil, crooil man!" she cried, & bust into teers."Won't you let my darter in?" sed anuther of the exsentricwimin, taken me afeckshunitely by the hand.  "O, please let mydarter in,--shee's a sweet gushin child of natur.""Let her gush!" roared I, as mad as I cood stick at theirtarnal nonsense; "let her gush!"  Where upon they all sprungback with the simultanious observashun that I was a Beest."My female friends," sed I, "be4 you leeve, I've a few remarksto remark; wa them well.  The female woman is one of thegreatest institooshuns of which this land can boste.  Itsonpossible to get along without her.  Had there bin no femalewimin in the world, I should scarcely be here with myunparalleld show on this very occashun.  She is good insickness--good in wellness--good all the time.  O woman,woman!" I cried, my feelins worked up to a hi poetick pitch,"you air a angle when you behave yourself; but when you takeoff your proper appairel & (mettyforically speaken)--get intopantyloons--when you desert your firesides, & with your hedsfull of wimin's rites noshuns go round like roarin lions,seekin whom you may devour someboddy--in short, when youundertake to play the man, you play the devil and air anemfatic noosance.  My female friends," I continnered, as theywere indignantly departin, "wa well what A. Ward has sed!"1.23.  WOULD-BE SEA DOGS.Sum of the captings on the Upper Ohio River put on a heep ofairs.  To hear 'em git orf saler lingo you'd spose they'd binon the briny Deep for a lifetime, when the fact is they hainttasted salt water since they was infants, when they had to takeit for WORMS.  Still they air good natered fellers, and whenthey drink they take a dose big enuff for a grown person.1.24.  THE PRINCE OF WALES.To my friends of the Editorial Corpse:I rite these lines on British sile.  I've bin follerin Mrs.Victory's hopeful sun Albert Edward threw Kanady with myonparaleled Show, and tho I haint made much in a pecoonary pintof vew, I've lernt sumthin new, over hear on British Sile,whare they bleeve in Saint George and the Dragoon.  Previs tocumin over hear I tawt my organist how to grind Rule Brittanyand other airs which is poplar on British Sile.  I likewisefixt a wax figger up to represent Sir Edmun Hed the GovnerGinral.  The statoot I fixt up is the most versytile waxstatoot I ever saw.  I've showd it as Wm. Penn, NapoleonBonypart, Juke of Wellington, the Beneker Boy, Mrs. Cunningham& varis other notid persons, and also for a sertin pirut namedHix.  I've bin so long amung wax statoots that I can fix 'em upto soot the tastes of folks, & with sum paints I hav I kin givtheir facis a beneverlent or fiendish look as the kaserequires.  I giv Sir Edmun Hed a beneverlent look, & when sumfolks who thawt they was smart sed it didn't look like SirEdmun Hed anymore than it did anybody else, I sed, "That's thepint.  That's the beauty of the Statoot.  It looks like SirEdmun Hed or any other man.  You may kall it what you pleese.Ef it don't look like anybody that ever lived, then it'ssertinly a remarkable Statoot & well worth seein.  _I_  kall itSir Edmun Hed.  YOU may kall it what you pleese!"  [I had 'emthare.]At larst I've had a interview with the Prince, tho it puttynigh cost me my vallerble life.  I cawt a glimpse of him as hesot on the Pizarro of the hotel in Sarnia, & elbowd myselfthrew a crowd of wimin, children, sojers & Injins that washangin round the tavern.  I was drawin near to the Prince whena red-faced man in Millingtery close grabd holt of me and axedme whare I was goin all so bold?"To see Albert Edard the Prince of Wales," sez I; "who areyou?"He sed he was Kurnel of the Seventy Fust Regiment, HerMagisty's troops.  I told him I hoped the Seventy Onesters wasin good helth, and was passin by when he ceased hold of meagin, and sed in a tone of indigent cirprise:"What?  Impossible!  It kannot be!  Blarst my hize, sir, did Iunderstan you to say that you was actooally goin into thepresents of his Royal Iniss?""That's what's the matter with me," I replide."But blarst my hize, sir, its onprecedented.  It's orful, sir.Nothin' like it hain't happened sins the Gun Powder Plot of GuyForks.  Owdashus man, who air you?""Sir," sez I, drawin myself up & puttin on a defiant air, "I'ma Amerycan sitterzen.  My name is Ward.  I'm a husband & thefather of twins, which I'm happy to state thay look like me.By perfeshun I'm a exhibiter of wax works & sich.""Good God!" yelled the Kurnal, "the idee of a exhibiter of waxfiggers goin into the presents of Royalty!  The British Lionmay well roar with raje at the thawt!"Sez I, "Speakin of the British Lion, Kurnal, I'd like to make abargin with you fur that beast fur a few weeks to add to myShow."  I didn't meen nothin by this.  I was only gettin orf agoak, but you roter hev seen the Old Kurnal jump up & howl.  Heactooally fomed at the mowth."This can't be real," he showtid.  "No, no.  It's a horriddream.  Sir, you air not a human bein--you hav no existents--yure a Myth!""Wall," sez I, "old hoss, yule find me a ruther onkomfortableMyth ef you punch my inards in that way agin."  I began to gita little riled, fur when he called me a Myth he puncht me puttyhard.  The Kurnal now commenst showtin fur the Seventy Onesters.I at fust thawt I'd stay & becum a Marter to British Outraje,as sich a course mite git my name up & be a good advertisementfur my Show, but it occurred to me that ef enny of the SeventyOnesters shood happen to insert a barronet into my stummick itmite be onplesunt, & I was on the pint of runnin orf when thePrince hisself kum up & axed me what the matter was.  Sez I,"Albert Edard, is that you?" & he smilt & sed it was.  Sez I,"Albert Edard, hears my keerd.  I cum to pay my respecks tothe futer King of Ingland.  The Kurnal of the Seventy Onestershear is ruther smawl pertaters, but of course you ain't to blamefur that.  He puts on as many airs as tho he was the Bully Boywith the glass eye.""Never mind," sez Albert Edard, "I'm glad to see you, MisterWard, at all events," & he tuk my hand so plesunt like & larfedso sweet that I fell in love with him to onct.  He handid me asegar & we sot down on the Pizarro & commenst smokin ritecheerful.  "Wall," sez I, "Albert Edard, how's the old folks?""Her Majesty & the Prince are well," he sed."Duz the old man take his Lager beer reglar?"  I inquired.The Prince larfed & intermatid that the old man didn't let manykegs of that bevridge spile in the sellar in the coarse of ayear.  We sot & tawked there sum time abowt matters & things, &bimeby I axed him how he liked bein Prince as fur as he'd got."To speak plain, Mister Ward," he sed, "I don't much like it.I'm sick of all this bowin & scrapin & crawlin & hurrain over aboy like me.  I would rather go through the country quietly &enjoy myself in my own way, with the other boys, & not be madea Show of to be garped at by everybody.  When the PEPLE cheer meI feel pleesed, fur I know they meen it; but if these one-horseoffishuls cood know how I see threw all their moves & understanexackly what they air after, & knowd how I larft at 'em inprivate, thayd stop kissin my hands & fawnin over me as thay nowdo.  But you know, Mr. Ward, I can't help bein a Prince, & Imust do all I kin to fit myself fur the persishun I must sumtimeockepy.""That's troo," sez I; "sickness and the docters will carry theQueen orf one of these dase, sure's yer born."The time hevin arove fur me to take my departer I rose up &sed:  "Albert Edard, I must go, but previs to doin so I willobsarve that you soot me.  Yure a good feller, Albert Edard, &tho I'm agin Princes as a gineral thing, I must say I like thecut of your Gib.  When you git to be King try and be as good aman as yure muther has bin!  Be just & be Jenerus, espeshullyto showmen, who hav allers bin aboozed sins the dase of Noah,who was the fust man to go into the Menagery bizniss, & ef thedaily papers of his time air to be beleeved Noah's colleckshunof livin wild beests beet ennything ever seen sins, tho I makebold to dowt ef his snaiks was ahead of mine.  Albert Edard,adoo!"  I tuk his hand which he shook warmly, & givin him aperpetooal free pars to my show, & also parses to take hum forthe Queen & old Albert, I put on my hat and walkt away."Mrs. Ward," I solilerquized, as I walkt along, "Mrs. Ward, efyou could see your husband now, just as he prowdly emerjis fromthe presunts of the futur King of Ingland, you'd be sorry youcalled him a Beest jest becaws he cum home tired 1 nite andwantid to go to bed without takin orf his boots.  You'd besorry for tryin to deprive yure husband of the priceliss Boonof liberty, Betsy Jane!"Jest then I met a long perseshun of men with gownds onto 'em.The leader was on horseback, & ridin up to me he sed, "Air youOrange?"Sez I, "Which?""Air you a Orangeman?" he repeated, sternly."I used to peddle lemins," sed I, "but I never delt in oranges.They are apt to spile on yure hands.  What particler LoonaticAsylum hev you & yure frends escaped frum, ef I may be sobold?"  Just then a suddent thawt struck me & I sed, "Oh yurethe fellers who air worryin the Prince so & givin the Juke ofNoocastle cold sweats at nite, by yure infernal catawalins, airyou?  Wall, take the advice of a Amerykin sitterzen, take orfthem gownds & don't try to get up a religious fite, which is 40times wuss nor a prize fite, over Albert Edard, who wants toreceive you all on a ekal footin, not keerin a tinker's cusswhat meetin house you sleep in Sundays.  Go home & mind yurebisness & not make noosenses of yourselves."  With whichobservashuns I left 'em.I shall leeve British sile 4thwith.1.25.  PICCOLOMINI.Gents,--I arroved in Cleveland on Saturday P.M. fromBaldinsville jest in time to fix myself up and put on a cleanbiled rag to attend Miss Picklehomony's grate musical sorry atthe Melodeon.  The krowds which pored into the hall auguredwell for the show bizniss, & with cheerful sperrets I jined theenthoosiastic throng.  I asked Mr. Strakhosh at the door if heparst the perfession, and he sed not much he didn't, whereuponI bawt a preserved seat in the pit, & obsarving to Mr.Strakhosh that he needn't put on so many French airs becawz herun with a big show, and that he'd better let his weskut out afew inches or perhaps he'd bust hisself some fine day, I wentin and squatted down.  It was a sad thawt to think that in allthat vast aujience Scacely a Sole had the honor of myacquaintance.  "& this ere," sed I Bitturly, "is Fame!  Whatsigerfy my wax figgers and livin wild beasts (which have noekels) to these peple?  What do thay care becawz a site of myKangeroo is worth dubble the price of admission, and that mySnaiks is as harmlis as the new born babe--all of which isstrictly troo?"  I should have gone on ralein at Fortin andthings sum more, but jest then Signer Maccarony cum out andsung a hairey from some opry or other.  He had on his storeclose & looked putty slick, I must say.  Nobody didn'tunderstand nothin abowt what he sed, and so they applawdid himversiferusly.  Then Signer Brignoly cum out and sung anotherhairey.  He appeared to be in a Pensiv Mood & sung a Luv song Isuppose, tho he may have been cussin the aujince all into aheep for aut I knewd.  Then cum Mr. Maccarony agin and MissPicklehomony herself.  Thay sang a Doit together.Now you know, gents, that I don't admire opry music.  But Ilike Miss Picklehomony's stile.  I like her gate.  She suitsme.  There has bin grater singers and there has bin morebootiful wimin, but no more fassinatin young female ever longedfor a new gown, or side to place her hed agin a vest patternthan Maria Picklehomony.  Fassinatin peple is her best holt.She was born to make hash of men's buzzums & other wimin madbecawz thay ain't Picklehomonies.  Her face sparkles withamuzin cussedness & about 200 (two hundred) little bit of funnydevils air continually dancing champion jigs in her eyes, sedeyes bein brite enuff to lite a pipe by.  How I shood like tohave little Maria out on my farm in Baldinsville, Injianny, whareshe cood run in the tall grass, wrastle with the boys, cut upstrong at parin bees, make up faces behind the minister's back,tie auction bills to the skoolmaster's coat-tales, set all thefellers crazy after her, & holler & kick up, & go it just asmuch as she wanted to!  But I diegress.  Every time she cumcanterin out I grew more and more delighted with her.  When shebowed her hed I bowed mine.  When she powtid her lips I powtidmine.  When she larfed I larfed.  When she jerked her hed backand took a larfin survey of the aujience, sendin a broadside ofsassy smiles in among em, I tried to unjint myself & kollapse.When, in tellin how she drempt she lived in Marble Halls, shesed it tickled her more than all the rest to dream she lovedher feller still the same, I made a effort to swaller myself;but when, in the next song, she look strate at me & called meher Dear, I wildly told the man next to me he mite hav my close,as I shood never want 'em again no more in this world.  [The"Plain Dealer" (The Cleveland "Plain Dealer," a well-knownOhio newspaper, to which Mr. Artemus Ward wishes us tounderstand he contributed.) containin this communicashun isnot to be sent to my famerly in Baldinsville under nocircumstances whatsomever.]In conclushun, Maria, I want you to do well.  I know you air anice gal at hart & you must get a good husband.  He must be a manof branes and gumpshun & a good provider--a man who will luv youstrong and long--a man who will luv you jest as much in your oldage, when your voice is cracked like an old tea kittle & you can'tget 1 of your notes discounted at 50 per sent a month, as he willnow, when you are young & charmin & full of music, sunshine & fun.Don't marry a snob, Maria.  You ain't a Angel, Maria, & I am gladof it.  When I see angels in pettycoats I'm always sorry theyhain't got wings so they kin quietly fly off whare thay will beappreshiated.  You air a woman, & a mity good one too.  As forMaccarony, Brignoly, Mullenholler, and them other fellers, they cantake care of theirselves.  Old Mac. kin make a comfortable livinchoppin cord wood if his voice ever givs out, and Amodio looks astho he mite succeed in conductin sum quiet toll gate, whare thevittles would be plenty & the labor lite.I am preparin for the Summer Campane.  I shall stay in Cleveland afew days and probly you will hear from me again ear I leave to oncemore becum a tosser on life's tempestuous billers, meanin the ShowBizniss.--Very Respectively Yours,Artemus Ward.1.26.  LITTLE PATTI.The moosic which Ime most use to is the inspirin stranes of thehand orgin. I hire a artistic Italyun to grind fur me, payin himhis vittles & close, & I spose it was them stranes which fust put amoosical taste into me.  Like all furriners, he had seen betterdase, havin formerly been a Kount.  But he aint of much akount now,except to turn the orgin and drink Beer, of which bevrige he canhold a churnful, EASY.Miss Patty is small for her size, but as the man sed abowt hiswife, O Lord!  She is well bilt & her complexion is what might becalled a Broonetty.  Her ize is a dark bay, the lashes bein long &silky.  When she smiles the awjince feels like axing her to doo itsum moor, & to continner doin it 2 a indefnit extent.  Her waste isone of the most bootiful wastisis ever seen.  When MisterStrackhorse led her out I thawt sum pretty skool gal, who had jestgraduatid frum pantalets & wire hoops, was a cumin out to read herfust composishun in public.  She cum so bashful like, with her hedbowd down, & made sich a effort to arrange her lips so thayd lookpretty, that I wanted to swaller her.  She reminded me of SusanSkinner, who'd never kiss the boys at parin bees till the candleswas blow'd out.  Miss Patty sung suthin or ruther in a furrin tung.I don't know what the sentimunts was.  Fur awt I know she may havbin denouncin my wax figgers & sagashus wild beests of Pray, & Idon't much keer ef she did.  When she opened her mowth a army ofmartingales, bobolinks, kanarys, swallers, mockin birds, etsettery,bust 4th& flew all over the Haul.Go it, little 1, sez I to myself, in a hily exsited frame of mind,& ef that kount or royal duke which you'll be pretty apt to marry 1of these dase don't do the fair thing by ye, yu kin always hav ahome on A. Ward's farm, near Baldinsville, Injianny.  When she sungCumin threw the Rye, and spoke of that Swayne she deerly luvdherself individooully, I didn't wish I was that air Swayne.  No Igess not.  Oh certainly not.  [This is Ironical.  I don't meenthis.  It's a way I hav of goakin.]  Now that Maria Picklehominyhas got married & left the perfeshun, Adeliny Patty is thechampioness of the opery ring.  She karries the Belt.  Thar's nodraw fite about it.  Other primy donnys may as well throw up thespunge first as last.  My eyes don't deceive my earsite in thismatter.But Miss Patty orter sing in the Inglish tung.  As she kin do so aswell as she kin in Italyun, why under the Son don't she do it?What cents is thare in singin wurds nobody don't understan whenwurds we do understan is jest as handy?  Why peple willversifferusly applawd furrin langwidge is a mistery.  It reminds meof a man I onct knew.  He sed he knockt the bottum out of his porkBarril, & the pork fell out, but the Brine dident moove a inch.  Itstade in the Barril.  He sed this was a Mistery, but it wasn'tmisterior than is this thing I'm speekin of.As fur Brignoly, Ferri and Junky, they air dowtless grate, but Ithink sich able boddied men wood look better tillin the sile thandressin theirselves up in black close & white kid gluvs & shoutinin a furrin tung.  Mister Junky is a noble lookin old man, & orterlead armies on to Battel instid of shoutin in a furrin tung.Adoo.  In the langwidge of Lewis Napoleon when receivin kumpany athis pallis on the Bullyvards, "I saloot yu."1.27.  OSSAWATOMIE BROWN.I don't pertend to be a cricket & consekently the reader will notregard this 'ere peace as a Cricketcism.  I cimply desine givin thepints & Plot of a play I saw actid out at the theatre t'other nite,called Ossywattermy Brown or the Hero of Harper's Ferry.Ossywattermy had varis failins, one of which was a idee that hecood conker Virginny with a few duzzen loonatics which he had picktup sumwhares, mercy only nose wher.  He didn't cum it, as the sekelshowed.  This play was jerkt by a admirer of Old Ossywattermy.First akt opens at North Elby, Old Brown's humsted.  Thare's aweddin at the house.  Amely, Old Brown's darter, marrys sumbody,and thay all whirl in the Messy darnce.  Then Ossywattermy and his3 sons leave fur Kansis.  Old Mrs. Ossywattermy tells 'em thay airgoin on a long jurny & Blesses 'em to slow fiddlin.  Thay go toKansis.  What upon arth thay go to Kansis fur when thay was so nice& comfortable down there to North Elby, is more'n I know.  The sunsair next seen in Kansis at a tarvern.  Mister Blane, a sinisterlookin man with his Belt full of knives & hoss pistils, axes one ofthe Browns to take a drink.  Brown refuzis, which is the fustinstance on record whar a Brown deklined sich a invite.  MisterBlane, who is a dark bearded feroshus lookin person, then axis himwhether he's fur or fernenst Slavery.  Yung Brown sez he's agin it,whareupon, Mister Blane, who is the most sinisterest lookin man Iever saw, sez Har, har, har! (that bein his stile of larfin wildly)& ups and sticks a knife into yung Brown.  Anuther Brown rushes up& sez, "you has killed me Ber-ruther!"  Moosic by the Band & Seenchanges.  The stuck yung Brown enters supported by his twobrothers. Bimeby he falls down, sez he sees his Mother, & dies.Moosic by the Band. I lookt but couldn't see any mother.  Next Seenreveels Old Brown's cabin. He's readin a book.  He sez freedum mustextend its Area & rubs his hands like he was pleesed abowt it.  Hissuns come in.  One of 'em goes out & cums in ded, havin bin shotwhile out by a Border Ruffin.  The ded yung Brown sez he sees hismother and tumbles down.  The Border Ruffins then surround thecabin & set it a fire.  The Browns giv theirselves up for gonecoons, when the hired gal diskivers a trap door to the cabin & thaygo down threw it & cum up threw the bulkhed.  Their merraklis'scape reminds me of the 'scape of De Jones, the Coarsehair of theGulf--a tail with a yaller kiver, that I onct red.  For sixteenyears he was confined in a loathsum dunjin, not tastin food durinall that time.  When a lucky thawt struck him!  He opend the winderand got out.  To resoom--Old Brown rushes down to the footlites,gits down on his nees & swares he'll hav revenge.  The battle ofOssawatermy takes place.  Old Brown kills Mister Blane, thesinister individooal aforesed.  Mister Blane makes a able &elerquent speech, sez he don't see his mother MUCH, and dies likethe son of a gentleman, rapt up in the Star Spangled banner.Moosic by the Band.  Four or five other Border ruffins air killed,but thay don't say nothin abowt seein their mothers.  From Kansisto Harper's Ferry.  Picter of a Arsenal is represented.  Sojers cum& fire at it.  Old Brown cums out & permits hisself to be shot.  Heis tride by two soops in milingtery close and sentenced to be hungon the gallus.  Tabloo--Old Brown on a platform, pintin upards, thestaige lited up with red fire.  Goddis of Liberty also on platform,pintin upards.  A dutchman in the orkestry warbles on a base drum.Curtin falls.

I'm reguvinated.  I've found the immortal waters ofyooth, so to speak, and am as limber and frisky as a two-year-oldsteer, and in the futur them boys which sez to me "go up, old Bawldhed," will do so at the peril of their hazard, individooally.  I'mvery happy.  My house is full of joy, and I have to git up nightsand larf!  Sumtimes I ax myself "is it not a dream?" & suthinwithinto me sez "it air;" but when I look at them sweet littlecritters and hear 'em squawk, I know it is a reality--2 realitys, Imay say--and I feel gay.I returnd from the Summer Campane with my unparaleld show of waxworks and livin wild Beests of Pray in the early part of thismunth.  The peple of Baldinsville met me cordully and I immejitlycommenst restin myself with my famerly.  The other nite while I wasdown to the tavurn tostin my shins agin the bar room fire & amuzinthe krowd with sum of my adventurs, who shood cum in bare heded &terrible excited but Bill Stokes, who sez, sez he, "Old Ward,there's grate doins up to your house."Sez I "William, how so?"Sez he, "Bust my gizzud but it's grate doins," & then he larfed asif he'd kill hisself.Sez I, risin and puttin on a austeer look, "William, I woodunt be afool if I had common cents."But he kept on larfin till he was black in the face, when he fellover on to the bunk where the hostler sleeps, and in a still smallvoice sed, "Twins!"  I ashure you gents that the grass didn't growunder my feet on my way home, & I was follered by a enthoosiasticthrong of my feller sitterzens, who hurrard for Old Ward at the topof their voises.  I found the house chock full of peple.  Thare wasMis Square Baxter and her three grown-up darters, lawyer Perkinseswife, Taberthy Ripley, young Eben Parsuns, Deakun Simmuns folks,the Skoolmaster, Doctor Jordin, etsetterry, etsetterry.  Mis Wardwas in the west room, which jines the kitchen.  Mis Square Baxterwas mixin suthin in a dipper before the kitchin fire, & a smallarmy of female wimin were rushin wildly round the house withbottles of camfire, peaces of flannil, &c. I never seed such ahubbub in my natral born dase.  I cood not stay in the west roomonly a minit, so strung up was my feelins, so I rusht out andceased my dubbel barrild gun."What upon airth ales the man?" sez Taberthy Ripley.  "Sakes alive,what air you doin?" & she grabd me by the coat tales.  "What's thematter with you?" she continnerd."Twins, marm," sez I, "twins!""I know it," sez she, coverin her pretty face with her apun."Wall," sez I, "that's what's the matter with me!""Wall, put down that air gun, you pesky old fool," sed she."No, marm," sez I, "this is a Nashunal day.  The glory of this hereday isn't confined to Baldinsville by a darn site.  On yonderwoodshed," sed I, drawin myself up to my full hite and speakin in ashow-actin voice, "will I fire a Nashunal saloot!" sayin whitch Itared myself from her grasp and rusht to the top of the shed whareI blazed away until Square Baxter's hired man and my son ArtemusJuneyer cum and took me down by mane force.On returnin to the Kitchin I found quite a lot of peple seated be4the fire, a talkin the event over.  They made room for me & I sotdown.  "Quite a eppisode," sed Docter Jordin, litin his pipe with ared-hot coal."Yes," sed I, "2 eppisodes, waying abowt 18 pounds jintly.""A perfeck coop de tat," sed the skoolmaster."E pluribus unum, in proprietor persony," sed I, thinking I'd lethim know I understood furrin langwidges as well as he did, if Iwasn't a skoolmaster."It is indeed a momentious event," sed young Eben Parsuns, who hasbeen 2 quarters to the Akademy."I never heard twins called by that name afore," sed I, "But Ispose it's all rite.""We shall soon have Wards enuff," sed the editer of theBaldinsville "Bugle of Liberty," who was lookin over a bundle ofexchange papers in the corner, "to apply to the legislater for aCity Charter!""Good for you, old man!" sed I; "giv that air a conspickius placein the next "Bugle.""How redicklus," sed pretty Susan Fletcher, coverin her face withher knittin work & larfin like all possest."Wall, for my part," sed Jane Maria Peasly, who is the crossest oldmade in the world, "I think you all act like a pack of fools."Sez I, "Miss Peasly, air you a parent?"Sez she, "No, I ain't."Sez I, "Miss Peasly, you never will be."She left.We sot there talkin & larfin until "the switchin hour of nite, whengrave yards yawn & Josts troop 4th," as old Bill Shakespire aptleeobsarves in his dramy of John Sheppard, esq, or the Moral HouseBreaker, when we broke up & disbursed.Muther & children is a doin well & as Resolushuns is the order ofthe day I will feel obleeged if you'll insurt the follerin--Whereas, two Eppisodes has happined up to the undersined's house,which is Twins; & Whereas I like this stile, sade twins bein of themale perswashun & both boys; there4 Be it--RESOLVED, That to them nabers who did the fare thing by sadeEppisodes my hart felt thanks is doo.RESOLVED, That I do most hartily thank Engine Ko.

WARD TO HIS WIFE.)Dear Betsy:  I write you this from Boston, "the Modern Atkins," asit is denomyunated, altho' I skurcely know what those air.  I'llgiv you a kursoory view of this city.  I'll klassify the paragrafsunder seprit headins, arter the stile of those Emblems of Troothand Poority, the Washinton correspongdents!COPP'S HILL.The winder of my room commands a exileratin view of Copps' Hill,where Cotton Mather, the father of the Reformers and sich, liesberrid.  There is men even now who worship Cotton, and there iswimin who wear him next their harts.  But I do not weep for him.He's bin ded too lengthy.  I ain't going to be absurd, like old Mr.Skillins, in our naberhood, who is ninety-six years of age, andgets drunk every 'lection day, and weeps Bitturly because he haintgot no Parents.  He's a nice Orphan, HE is.BUNKER HILL.Bunker Hill is over yonder in Charleston.  In 1776 a thrillin dramywas acted out over there, in which the "Warren Combination" playedstar parts.MR. FANUEL.Old Mr. Fanuel is ded, but his Hall is still into full blarst.This is the Cradle in which the Goddess of Liberty was rocked, myDear.  The Goddess hasn't bin very well durin' the past few years,and the num'ris quack doctors she called in didn't help her any;but the old gal's physicians now are men who understand theirbizness, Major-generally speakin', and I think the day is near whenshe'll be able to take her three meals a day, and sleep nights ascomf'bly as in the old time.THE COMMON.It is here, as ushil; and the low cuss who called it a Wacant Lot,and wanted to know why they didn't ornament it with sum Bildins',is a onhappy Outcast in Naponsit.THE LEGISLATUR.The State House is filled with Statesmen, but sum of 'em wear queerhats.  They buy 'em, I take it, of hatters who carry on hat storesdown-stairs in Dock Square, and whose hats is either ten yearsahead of the prevailin' stile, or ten years behind it--jest as aintellectooal person sees fit to think about it.  I had thepleasure of talkin' with sevril members of the legislatur.  I told'em the Eye of 1000 ages was onto we American peple of to-day.They seemed deeply impressed by the remark, and wantid to know if Ihad seen the Grate Orgin?HARVARD COLLEGE.This celebrated institootion of learnin is pleasantly situated inthe Bar-room of Parker's in School street, and has poopils from allover the country.I had a letter yes'd'y, by the way, from our mootual son, Artemus,Jr., who is at Bowdoin College in Maine.  He writes that he's aBowdoin Arab. & is it cum to this?  Is this Boy as I nurtered witha Parent's care into his childhood's hour--is he goin' to be aGrate American humorist?  Alars!  I fear it is too troo.  Whydidn't I bind him out to the Patent Travellin Vegetable Pill Man,as was struck with his appearance at our last County Fair, & wantedhim to go with him and be a Pillist?  Ar, these Boys--they littleknow how the old folks worrit about 'em.  But my father he neverhad no occasion to worrit about me.  You know, Betsy, that when Ifust commenced my career as a moral exhibitor with a six-legged catand a Bass drum, I was only a simple peasant child--skurce 15Summers had flow'd over my yoothful hed.  But I had sum mind of myown.  My father understood this. "Go," he sed--"go, my son, and hogthe public!" (he ment, "knock em," but the old man was allus alittle given to slang).  He put his withered han' tremblinly ontomy hed, and went sadly into the house.  I thought I saw tearstricklin down his venerable chin, but it might hav been tobackerjooce.  He chaw'd.LITERATOOR.The "Atlantic Monthly," Betsy, is a reg'lar visitor to our westunhome.  I like it because it has got sense.  It don't print storieswith piruts and honist young men into 'em, makin' the pirutssplendid fellers and the honist young men dis'gree'ble idiots--sothat our darters very nat'rally prefer the piruts to the honistyoung idiots; but it gives us good square American literatoor.  Thechaps that write for the "Atlantic," Betsy, understand theirbizness.  They can sling ink, they can.  I went in and saw 'em.  Itold 'em that theirs was a high and holy mission.  They seemedquite gratified, and asked me if I had seen the Grate Orgin.WHERE THE FUST BLUD WAS SPILT.I went over to Lexington yes'd'y.  My Boozum hove with sollumemotions.  "& this," I sed to a man who was drivin' a yoke of oxen,"this is where our revolutionary forefathers asserted theirindependence and spilt their Blud.  Classic ground!""Wall," the man sed, "it's good for white beans and potatoes, butwas regards raisin' wheat, t'ain't worth a damn.  But hav' you seenthe Grate Orgin?"THE POOTY GIRL IN SPECTACLES.I returned in the Hoss Cars, part way.  A pooty girl in spectaclessot near me, and was tellin' a young man how much he reminded herof a man she used to know in Walthan.  Pooty soon the young man gotout, and, smilin' in a seductive manner, I said to the girl inspectacles, "Don't _I_ remind you of somebody you used to know?""Yes," she sed, "you do remind me of one man, but he was sent tothe penitentiary for stealin' a Bar'l of mackril--he died there, soI conclood you ain't HIM."  I didn't pursoo the conversation.  Ionly heard her silvery voice once more durin' the remainder of thejerney.  Turnin' to a respectable lookin' female of advancedsummers, she asked her if she had seen the Grate Orgin.We old chaps, my dear, air apt to forget that it is sum time sincewe was infants, and et lite food.  Nothin' of further int'rist tookplace on the cars excep' a colored gentleman, a total stranger tome, asked if I'd lend him my diamond Brestpin to wear to a funeralin South Boston.  I told him I wouldn't--not a PURPUSS.WILD GAMEAltho' fur from the prahayries, there is abundans of wild game inBoston, such as quails, snipes, plover, ans Props.  (The game of"props," played with cowrie shells is, I believe, peculiar to thecity of Boston.)COMMON SKOOLS.A excellent skool sistim is in vogy here.  John Slurk, my oldpardner, has a little son who has only bin to skool two months, andyet he exhibertid his father's performin' Bear in the show all lastsummer.  I hope they pay partic'lar 'tention to Spelin in theseSkools, because if a man can't Spel wel he's of no 'kount.SUMMIN' UP.I ment to have allooded to the Grate Orgin in this letter, but Ihaven't seen it.  Mr. Reveer, whose tavern I stop at, informed methat it can be distinctly heard through a smoked glass in his nativtown in New Hampshire, any clear day.  But settin' the Grate Orginaside (and indeed, I don't think I heard it mentioned all the timeI was there), Boston is one of the grandest, sure-footedest, clearheadedest, comfortablest cities on the globe.  Onlike ev'ry otherlarge city I was ever in, the most of the hackmen don't seem tohav' bin speshully intended by natur for the Burglery perfession,and it's about the only large city I know of where you don't enjoya brilliant opportunity of bein swindled in sum way, from the Risinof the sun to the goin down thereof.  There4 I say, loud andcontinnered applaus' for Boston!DOMESTIC MATTERS.Kiss the children for me.  What you tell me 'bout the Twins greevesme sorely.  When I sent 'em that Toy Enjine I had notcontempyulated that they would so fur forgit what wos doo thedignity of our house as to squirt dishwater on the Incum TaxCollector.  It is a disloyal act, and shows a prematoor leanin'tords cussedness that alarms me.  I send to Amelia Ann, our oldestdawter, sum new music, viz. "I am Lonely sints My Mother-in-lawDied"; "Dear Mother, What tho' the Hand that Spanked me in myChildhood's Hour is withered now?" &c.  These song writers, by theway, air doin' the Mother Bizness rather too muchly.

HOW OLD ABE RECEIVED THE NEWS OF HIS NOMINATION.There are several reports afloat as to how "Honest Old Abe"received the news of his nomination, none of which are correct.  Wegive the correct report.The Official Committee arrived in Springfield at dewy eve, and wentto Honest Old Abe's house.  Honest Old Abe was not in.  Mrs. HonestOld Abe said Honest Old Abe was out in the woods splitting rails.So the Official Committee went out into the woods, where sureenough they found Honest Old Abe splitting rails with his two boys.It was a grand, a magnificent spectacle.  There stood Honest OldAbe in his shirt-sleeves, a pair of leather home-made suspendersholding up a pair of home-made pantaloons, the seat of which wasneatly patched with substantial cloth of a different color.  "MrLincoln, Sir, you've been nominated, Sir, for the highest office,Sir--."  "Oh, don't bother me," said Honest Old Abe; "I took aSTENT this mornin' to split three million rails afore night, and Idon't want to be pestered with no stuff about no Conventions till Iget my stent done.  I've only got two hundred thousand rails tosplit before sundown.  I kin do it if you'll let me alone."  Andthe great man went right on splitting rails, paying no attention tothe Committee whatever.  The Committee were lost in admiration fora few moments, when they recovered, and asked one of Honest OldAbe's boys whose boy he was?  "I'm my parent's boy," shouted theurchin, which burst of wit so convulsed the Committee that theycame very near "gin'in eout" completely.  In a few moments HonestOle Abe finished his task, and received the news with perfectself-possession. He then asked them up to the house, where hereceived them cordially.  He said he split three million rails everyday, although he was in very poor health.  Mr. Lincoln is a jovialman, and has a keen sense of the ludicrous.  During the evening heasked Mr. Evarts, of New York, "why Chicago was like a hen crossingthe street?"  Mr. Evarts gave it up.  "Because," said Mr. Lincoln,"Old Grimes is dead, that good old man!"  This exceedingly humorousthing created the most uproarious laughter.1.31.  INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT LINCOLN.I hav no politics.  Not a one.  I'm not in the bisiness.  If I wasI spose I should holler versiffrusly in the streets at nite and gohome to Betsy Jane smellen of coal ile and gin, in the mornin.  Ishould go to the Poles arly. I should stay there all day.  I shouldsee to it that my nabers was thar.  I should git carriges to takethe kripples, the infirm and the indignant thar.  I should be onguard agin frauds and sich.  I should be on the look out for theinfamus lise of the enemy, got up jest be4 elecshun for perliticaleffeck.  When all was over and my candydate was elected, I shouldmove heving & erth--so to speak--until I got orfice, which if Ididn't git a orfice I should turn round and abooze theAdministration with all my mite and maine.  But I'm not in thebizniss.  I'm in a far more respectful bizniss nor what pollerticsis.  I wouldn't giv two cents to be a Congresser.  The wuss insultI ever received was when sertin citizens of Baldinsville axed me torun fur the Legislater.  Sez I, "My frends, dostest think I'd stoopto that there?"  They turned as white as a sheet.  I spoke in mymost orfullest tones & they knowed I wasn't to be trifled with.They slunked out of site to onct.There4, havin no politics, I made bold to visit Old Abe at hishumstid in Springfield.  I found the old feller in his parler,surrounded by a perfeck swarm of orfice seekers.  Knowin he hadbeen capting of a flat boat on the roarin Mississippy I thought I'daddress him in sailor lingo, so sez I, "Old Abe, ahoy!  Let out yermain-suls, reef hum the forecastle & throw yer jib-poop over-board!Shiver my timbers, my harty!"  [N.B.  This is ginuine marinerlangwidge.  I know, becawz I've seen sailor plays acted out by themNew York theatre fellers.]  Old Abe lookt up quite cross & sez,"Send in yer petition by & by.  I can't possibly look at it now.Indeed, I can't.  It's onpossible, sir!""Mr. Linkin, who do you spect I air?" sed I."A orfice-seeker, to be sure," sed he."Wall, sir," sed I, "you's never more mistaken in your life.  Youhain't gut a orfiss I'd take under no circumstances.  I'm A. Ward.Wax figgers is my perfeshun.  I'm the father of Twins, and theylook like me--BOTH OF THEM.  I cum to pay a friendly visit to thePresident eleck of the United States.  If so be you wants to seeme, say so,--if not, say so & I'm orf like a jug handle.""Mr. Ward, sit down.  I am glad to see you, Sir.""Repose in Abraham's Buzzum!" sed one of the orfice seekers, hisidee bein to git orf a goak at my expense."Wall," sez I, "ef all you fellers repose in that there Buzzumthar'll be mity poor nussin for sum of you!" whereupon Old Abebuttoned his weskit clear up and blusht like a maidin of sweet16.  Jest at this pint of the conversation another swarm oforfice-seekers arrove & cum pilin into the parler.  Sum wantedpost orfices, sum wanted collectorships, sum wantid furrinmissions, and all wanted sumthin.  I thought Old Abe would gocrazy. He hadn't more than had time to shake hands with 'em,before another tremenjis crowd cum porein onto his premises.  Hishouse and dooryard was now perfeckly overflowed with orfice seekers,all clameruss for a immejit interview with with Old Abe.  One manfrom Ohio, who had about seven inches of corn whisky into him,mistook me for Old Abe and addrest me as "The Pra-hayrie Flower ofthe West!"  Thinks I YOU want a offiss putty bad.  Another man witha gold-heded cane and a red nose told Old Abe he was "a seckindWashington & the Pride of the Boundliss West."Sez I, "Square, you wouldn't take a small post-offiss if you couldgit it, would you?"Sez he, "A patrit is abuv them things, sir!""There's a putty big crop of patrits this season, ain't there,Squire?" sez I, when ANOTHER crowd of offiss seekers pored in.  Thehouse, dooryard, barng & woodshed was now all full, and whenANOTHER crowd cum I told 'em not to go away for want of room as thehog-pen was still empty.  One patrit from a small town in Michyganwent up on top the house, got into the chimney and slid into theparler where Old Abe was endeverin to keep the hungry pack oforfice-seekers from chawin him up alive without benefit of clergy.The minit he reached the fireplace he jumpt up, brusht the soot outof his eyes, and yelled:  "Don't make eny pintment at theSpunkville postoffiss till you've read my papers.  All therespectful men in our town is signers to that there dockyment!""Good God!" cried Old Abe, "they cum upon me from the skize--downthe chimneys, and from the bowels of the yerth!"  He hadn't more'ngot them words out of his delikit mouth before two fatoffiss-seekers from Winconsin, in endeverin to crawl atween hislegs for the purpuss of applyin for the tollgateship at Milwawky,upsot the President eleck, & he would hev gone sprawlin into thefireplace if I hadn't caught him in these arms.  But I hadn't more'nstood him up strate before another man cum crashing down the chimney,his head strikin me viliently again the inards and prostratin myvoluptoous form onto the floor.  "Mr. Linkin," shoutid theinfatooated being, "my papers is signed by every clergyman in ourtown, and likewise the skoolmaster!"Sez I, "You egrejis ass," gittin up & brushin the dust from myeyes, "I'll sign your papers with this bunch of bones, if you don'tbe a little more keerful how you make my bread basket a depot inthe futur.  How do you like that air perfumery?" sez I, shuving myfist under his nose.  "Them's the kind of papers I'll give you!Them's the papers YOU want!""But I workt hard for the ticket; I toiled night and day!  Thepatrit should be rewarded!""Virtoo," sed I, holdin' the infatooated man by the coat-collar,"virtoo, sir, is its own reward.  Look at me!"  He did look at me,and qualed be4 my gase.  "The fact is," I continued, lookin' roundon the hungry crowd, "there is scacely a offiss for every ile lampcarrid round durin' this campane.  I wish thare was.  I wish tharewas furrin missions to be filled on varis lonely Islands whereeppydemics rage incessantly, and if I was in Old Abe's place I'dsend every mother's son of you to them.  What air you here for?" Icontinnered, warmin up considerable, "can't you giv Abe a minit'speace?  Don't you see he's worrid most to death?  Go home, youmiserable men, go home & till the sile!  Go to peddlin tinware--goto choppin wood--go to bilin' sope--stuff sassengers--black boots--git a clerkship on sum respectable manure cart--go round asoriginal Swiss Bell Ringers--becum 'origenal and only' CampbellMinstrels--go to lecturin at 50 dollars a nite--imbark in thepeanut bizniss--WRITE FOR THE 'LEDGER'--saw off your legs and goround givin concerts, with tuchin appeals to a charitable public,printed on your handbills--anything for a honest living, but don'tcome round here drivin Old Abe crazy by your outrajis cuttings up!Go home.  Stand not upon the order of your goin,' but go to onct!Ef in five minits from this time," sez  I, pullin' out my newsixteen dollar huntin cased watch and brandishin' it before theireyes, "Ef in five minits from this time a single sole of youremains on these here premises, I'll go out to my cage near by, andlet my Boy Constructor loose! & ef he gits amung you, you'll thinkold Solferino has cum again and no mistake!"  You ought to hev seenthem scamper, Mr. Fair.  They run ort as tho Satun hisself wasarter them with a red hot ten pronged pitchfork.  In five minitsthe premises was clear."How kin I ever repay you, Mr. Ward, for your kindness?" sed OldAbe, advancin and shakin me warmly by the hand.  "How kin I everrepay you, sir?""By givin the whole country a good, sound administration.  Bypoerin' ile upon the troubled waturs, North and South.  Bypursooin' a patriotic, firm, and just course, and then if any Statewants to secede, let 'em Sesesh!""How 'bout my Cabinit, Mister Ward?" sed Abe."Fill it up with Showmen, sir!  Showmen, is devoid of politics.They hain't got any principles.  They know how to cater for thepublic.  They know what the public wants, North & South.  Showmen,sir, is honest men.  Ef you doubt their literary ability, look attheir posters, and see small bills!  Ef you want a Cabinit as is aCabinit fill it up with showmen, but don't call on me.

Linkin,use the talents which Nature has put into you judishusly andfirmly, and all will be well!  A. Linkin, adoo!"He shook me cordyully by the hand--we exchanged picters, so wecould gaze upon each other's liniments, when far away from oneanother--he at the hellum of the ship of State, and I at the hellumof the show bizniss--admittance only 15 cents.1.32.  INTERVIEW WITH THE PRINCE NAPOLEON.Notwithstandin I hain't writ much for the papers of late, nobodyneedn't flatter theirselves that the undersined is ded.  On thecontry, "I still live," which words was spoken by Danyil Webster,who was a able man.  Even the old-line whigs of Boston will admitTHAT.  Webster is ded now, howsever, and his mantle has problyfallen into the hands of sum dealer in 2nd hand close, who can'tsell it.  Leastways nobody pears to be goin round wearin it to anyperticler extent, now days.  The rigiment of whom I was kurnel,finerly concluded they was better adapted as Home Gards, whichaccounts for your not hearin of me, ear this, where the bauls isthe thickest and where the cannon doth roar.  But as a Americancitizen I shall never cease to admire the masterly advance ourtroops made on Washinton from Bull Run, a short time ago.  It waswell dun.  I spoke to my wife 'bout it at the time.  My wife sed itwas well dun.It havin there4 bin detarmined to pertect Baldinsville at allhazzuds, and as there was no apprehensions of any immejit danger, Ithought I would go orf onto a pleasure tower.  Accordinly I put ona clean Biled Shirt and started for Washinton.  I went there to seethe Prints Napoleon, and not to see the place, which I will heretake occasion to obsarve is about as uninterestin a locality asthere is this side of J. Davis's future home, if he ever does die,and where I reckon they'll make it so warm for him that he will sifor his summer close.  It is easy enough to see why a man goes tothe poor house or the penitentiary.  It's becawz he can't help it.But why he should woluntarily go and live in Washinton, is intirelybeyond my comprehension, and I can't say no fairer nor that.I put up to a leadin hotel.  I saw the landlord and sed, "How d'yedo, Square?""Fifty cents, sir," was his reply."Sir?""Half-a-dollar.  We charge twenty-five cents for LOOKIN at thelandlord and fifty cents for speakin to him.  If you want supper, aboy will show you to the dinin-room for twenty-five cents.  Yourroom bein in the tenth story, it will cost you a dollar to be shownup there.""How much do you ax for a man breathin in this equinomikal tarvun?"sed I."Ten cents a Breth," was his reply.Washinton hotels is very reasonable in their charges.  [N.B.--Thisis Sarkassum.]I sent up my keerd to the Prints, and was immejitly ushered beforehim.  He received me kindly, and axed me to sit down."I hav cum to pay my respecks to you, Mister Napoleon, hopin I seeyou hale and harty.""I am quite well," he sed.  "Air you well, sir?""Sound as a cuss!" I answerd.He seemed to be pleased with my ways, and we entered intoconversation to onct."How's Lewis?" I axed, and he sed the Emperor was well.  Eugeny waslikewise well, he sed.  Then I axed him was Lewis a good provider?did he cum home arly nites? did he perfoom her bedroom at aonseasonable hour with gin and tanzy?  Did he go to "the Lodge" onnites when there wasn't any Lodge? did he often hav to go down townto meet a friend? did he hav a extensiv acquaintance among pooryoung widders whose husbands was in Californy? to all of whichquestions the Prints perlitely replide, givin me to understand thatthe Emperor was behavin well."I ax these question, my royal duke and most noble hiness andimperials, becaws I'm anxious to know how he stands as a man.  Iknow he's smart.  He is cunnin, he is long-heded, he is deep--he isgrate.  But onless he is GOOD he'll come down with a crash one ofthese days and the Bonyparts will be Bustid up agin.  Bet yerlife!""Air you a preacher, sir?" he inquired slitely sarkasticul."No, sir.  But I bleeve in morality.  I likewise bleeve in MeetinHouses.  Show me a place where there isn't any Meetin Houses andwhere preachers is never seen, and I'll show you a place where oldhats air stuffed into broken winders, where the children air dirtyand ragged, where gates have no hinges, where the wimin areslipshod, and where maps of the devil's "wild land" air paintedupon men's shirt bosums with tobacco-jooce!  That's what I'll showyou.  Let us consider what the preachers do for us before we aboose'em."He sed he didn't mean to aboose the clergy.  Not at all, and he washappy to see that I was interested in the Bonypart family."It's a grate family," sed I. "But they scooped the old man in.""How, Sir?""Napoleon the Grand.  The Britishers scooped him at Waterloo.  Hewanted to do too much, and he did it!  They scooped him in atWaterloo, and he subsekently died at St. Heleny!  There's where thegratest military man this world ever projuced pegged out.  It wasrather hard to consine such a man as him to St. Heleny, to spendhis larst days in catchin mackeril, and walkin up and down thedreary beach in a military cloak drawn titely round him, (seepicter-books), but so it was.  'Hed of the Army!'  Them was hislarst words.  So he had bin.  He was grate!  Don't I wish we had apair of his old boots to command sum of our Brigades!"This pleased Jerome, and he took me warmly by the hand."Alexander the Grate was punkins," I continnered, "but Napoleon waspunkinser!  Alic wept becaws there was no more worlds to scoop, andthen took to drinkin.  He drowndid his sorrers in the flowin bole,and the flowin bole was too much for him.  It ginerally is.  Heundertook to give a snake exhibition in his boots, but it killedhim.  That was a bad joke on Alic!""Since you air so solicitous about France and the Emperor, may Iask you how your own country is getting along?" sed Jerome, in apleasant voice."It's mixed," I sed.  But I think we shall cum out all right.""Columbus, when he diskivered this magnificent continent, could havhad no idee of the grandeur it would one day assoom," sed thePrints."It cost Columbus twenty thousand dollars to fit out his explorinexpedition," sed I.  "If he had bin a sensible man he'd hav put themoney in a hoss railroad or a gas company, and left thismagnificent continent to intelligent savages, who when they gothold of a good thing knew enuff to keep it, and who wouldn't havseceded, nor rebelled, nor knockt Liberty in the hed with aslungshot.  Columbus wasn't much of a feller, after all.  It wouldhav bin money in my pocket if he'd staid at home.  Chris. mentwell, but he put his foot in it when he saled for America."We talked sum more about matters and things, and at larst I riz togo.  "I will now say good-bye to you, noble sir, and good luck toyou.  Likewise the same to Clotildy.  Also to the gorgeous personswhich compose your soot.  If the Emperor's boy don't like livin atthe Tooleries, when he gits older, and would like to imbark in theshow bizness, let him come with me and I'll make a man of him.  Youfind us sumwhat mixed, as I before obsarved, but come again nextyear and you'll find us clearer nor ever.  The American Eagle haslived too sumptuously of late--his stummic becum foul, and he'stakin a slite emetic.  That's all.  We're getting ready to strike abig blow and a sure one.  When we do strike, the fur will fly andsecession will be in the hands of the undertaker, sheeted for sodeep a grave that nothin short of Gabriel's trombone will everawaken it!  Mind what I say.  You've heard the showman!"Then advisin him to keep away from the Peter Funk sections of theEast, and the proprietors of corner-lots in the West, I bid himfarewell, and went away.There was a levee at Senator What's-his-name's, and I thought I'djine in the festivities for a spell.  Who should I see but she thatwas Sarah Watkins, now the wife of our Congresser, trippin in thedance, dressed up to kill in her store close.  Sarah's father useto keep a little grosery store in our town and she used to clerk itfor him in busy times.  I was rushin up to shake hands with herwhen she turned on her heel, and tossin her hed in a contemptooiousmanner, walked away from me very rapid.  "Hallo, Sal," I hollered,"can't you measure me a quart of them best melasses?  I may want acodfish, also!"  I guess this reminded her of the little red store,and "the days of her happy childhood."But I fell in love with a nice little gal after that, who was muchsweeter then Sally's father's melasses, and I axed her if weshouldn't glide in the messy dance.  She sed we should, and weGlode.I intended to make this letter very seris, but a few goaks may haveaccidentally crept in.  Never mind.  Besides, I think it improves akomick paper to publish a goak once in a while.                                   Yours Muchly,                                                Ward, (Artemus.)1.33.  AGRICULTURE.The Barclay County Agricultural Society having seriously invitedthe author of this volume to address them on the occasion of theirnext annual Fair, he wrote the President of that Society asfollows:                                         New York.  June 12, 1865,Dear Sir:--I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the5th inst., in which you invite me to deliver an address before yourexcellent agricultural society.I feel flattered, and think I will come.Perhaps, meanwhile, a brief history of my experience as anagriculturist will be acceptable; and as that history no doubtcontains suggestions of value to the entire agricultural community,I have concluded to write to you through the Press.I have been an honest old farmer for some four years.My farm is in the interior of Maine.  Unfortunately my lands areeleven miles from the railroad.  Eleven miles is quite a distanceto haul immense quantities of wheat, corn, rye, and oats; but as Ihav'n't any to haul, I do not, after all, suffer much on thataccount.My farm is more especially a grass farm.My neighbors told me so at first, and as an evidence that they weresincere in that opinion, they turned their cows on to it the momentI went off "lecturing."These cows are now quite fat.  I take pride in these cows, in fact,and am glad I own a grass farm.Two years ago I tried sheep-raising.I bought fifty lambs, and turned them loose on my broad andbeautiful acres.It was pleasant on bright mornings to stroll leisurely out on tothe farm in my dressing-gown, with a cigar in my mouth, and watchthose innocent little lambs as they danced gayly o'er the hillside.Watching their saucy capers reminded me of caper sauce, and itoccurred to me I should have some very fine eating when they grewup to be "muttons."My gentle shepherd, Mr. Eli Perkins, said, "We must have someshepherd dogs."I had no very precise idea as to what shepherd dogs were, but Iassumed a rather profound look, and said:"We must, Eli.  I spoke to you about this some time ago!"I wrote to my old friend, Mr. Dexter H. Follett, of Boston, for twoshepherd dogs.  Mr. F. is not an honest old farmer himself, but Ithought he knew about shepherd dogs.  He kindly forsook far moreimportant business to accommodate, and the dogs came forthwith.They were splendid creatures--snuff-colored, hazel-eyed,long-tailed, and shapely-jawed.We led them proudly to the fields."Turn them in, Eli," I said.Eli turned them in.They went in at once, and killed twenty of my best lambs in aboutfour minutes and a half.My friend had made a trifling mistake in the breed of these dogs.These dogs were not partial to sheep.Eli Perkins was astonished, and observed:"Waal! DID you ever?"I certainly never had.There were pools of blood on the greensward, and fragments of wooland raw lamb chops lay round in confused heaps.The dogs would have been sent to Boston that night, had they notsuddenly died that afternoon of a throat-distemper.  It wasn't aswelling of the throat.  It wasn't diptheria.  It was a violentopening of the throat, extending from ear to ear.Thus closed their life-stories.  Thus ended their interestingtails.I failed as a raiser of lambs.  As a sheepist, I was not a success.Last summer Mr. Perkins, said, "I think we'd better cut some grassthis season, sir."We cut some grass.To me the new-mown hay is very sweet and nice.  The brilliantGeorge Arnold sings about it, in beautiful verse, down in Jerseyevery summer; so does the brilliant Aldrich, at Portsmouth, N.H.And yet I doubt if either of these men knows the price of a ton ofhay to-day.  But new-mown hay is a really fine thing.  It is goodfor man and beast.We hired four honest farmers to assist us, and I led them gayly tothe meadows.I was going to mow, myself.I saw the sturdy peasants go round once ere I dipped my flashingscythe into the tall green grass."Are you ready?" said E. Perkins."I am here!""Then follow us."I followed them.Followed them rather too closely, evidently, for a white-haired oldman, who immediately followed Mr. Perkins, called upon us to halt.Then in a low firm voice he said to his son, who was just ahead ofme, "John, change places with me.  I hain't got long to live,anyhow.  Yonder berryin' ground will soon have these old bones, andit's no matter whether I'm carried there with one leg off andter'ble gashes in the other or not!  But you, John--YOU are young."The old man changed places with his son.  A smile of calmresignation lit up his wrinkled face, as he sed, "Now, sir, I amready!""What mean you, old man!" I sed."I mean that if you continner to bran'ish that blade as you havebeen bran'ishin' it, you'll slash h-- out of some of us beforewe're a hour older!"There was some reason mingled with this white-haired old peasant'sprofanity.  It was true that I had twice escaped mowing off hisson's legs, and his father was perhaps naturally alarmed.I went and sat down under a tree.  "I never know'd a literary manin my life," I overheard the old man say, "that know'd anything."Mr. Perkins was not as valuable to me this season as I had fanciedhe might be.  Every afternoon he disappeared from the fieldregularly, and remained about some two hours.  He sed it washeadache.  He inherited it from his mother.  His mother was oftentaken in that way, and suffered a great deal.At the end of the two hours Mr. Perkins would reappear with hishead neatly done up in a large wet rag, and say he "felt better."One afternoon it so happened that I soon followed the invalid tothe house, and as I neared the porch I heard a female voiceenergetically observe, "You stop!"  It was the voice of the hiredgirl, and she added, "I'll holler for Mr. Brown!""Oh no, Nancy," I heard the invalid E. Perkins soothingly say, "Mr.Brown knows I love you.  Mr. Brown approves of it!"This was pleasant for Mr. Brown!I peered cautiously through the kitchen-blinds, and, howeverunnatural it may appear, the lips of Eli Perkins and my hired girlwere very near together.  She sed, "You shan't do so," and heDO-SOED.  She also said she would get right up and go away, and asan evidence that she was thoroughly in earnest about it, sheremained where she was.They are married now, and Mr. Perkins is troubled no more with theheadache.This year we are planting corn.  Mr. Perkins writes me that "onaccounts of no skare krows bein put up krows cum and digged fustcrop up but soon got nother in.  Old Bisbee who was frade youd cuthis sons leggs off Ses you bet go an stan up in feeld yrself withdressin gownd on & gesses krows will keep way.  This made Boys instore larf.  no More terday from                        "Yours                                respecful                                          "Eli Perkins,"                      "his letter."My friend Mr. D.T.T. Moore, of the "Rural New Yorker," thinks if I"keep on" I will get in the Poor House in about two years.If you think the honest old farmers of Barclay County want me, Iwill come.                             Truly Yours,                                            Charles F. Browne.1.34.  BUSTS.There are in this city several Italian gentlemen engaged in the bustbusiness.  They have their peculiarities and eccentricities.  Theyare swarthy-faced, wear slouched caps and drab pea-jackets, andsmoke bad cigars.  They make busts of Webster, Clay, Bonaparte,Douglas, and other great men, living and dead.  The Italian bustercomes upon you solemnly and cautiously.  "Buy Napoleon?" he willsay, and you may probably answer "not a buy."  "How much giv-ee?" heasks, and perhaps you will ask him how much he wants.  "Ninedollar," he will answer always.  We are sure of it.  We haveobserved this peculiarity in the busters frequently.  No matter howlarge or small the bust may be, the first price is invariably "ninedollar."  If you decline paying this price, as you undoubtedly willif you are right in your head, he again asks, "how much giv-ee?"  Byway of a joke you say "a dollar," when the buster retreatsindignantly to the door, saying in a low, wild voice, "O dam!"  Withhis hand upon the door-latch, he turns and once more asks, "how muchgiv-ee?"  You repeat the previous offer, when he mutters, "O ha!"then coming pleasantly towards you, he speaks thus:  "Say! how muchgiv-ee?"  Again you say a dollar, and he cries, "take 'um--take'um!"--thus falling eight dollars on his original price.Very eccentric is the Italian buster, and sometimes he calls hisbusts by wrong names.  We bought Webster (he called him Web-STAR) ofhim the other day, and were astonished when he called upon us thenext day with another bust of Webster, exactly like the one we hadpurchased of him, and asked us if we didn't want to buy "Cole, thewife-pizener!"  We endeavored to rebuke the depraved buster, but ourutterance was choked, and we could only gaze upon him in speechlessastonishment and indignation.1.35.  A HARD CASE.We have heard of some very hard cases since we have enlivened thisworld with our brilliant presence.  We once saw an able-bodied manchase a party of little school-children and rob them of theirdinners.  The man who stole the coppers from his deceasedgrandmother's eyes lived in our neighborhood, and we have read aboutthe man who went to church for the sole purpose of stealing thetestaments and hymn-books.  But the hardest case we ever heard oflived in Arkansas.  He was only fourteen years old.  One night hedeliberately murdered his father and mother in cold blood, with ameat-axe.  He was tried and found guilty.  The Judge drew on hisblack cap, and in a voice choked with emotion asked the youngprisoner if he had anything to say before the sentence of the Courtwas passed on him.  The court-room was densely crowded and there wasnot a dry eye in the vast assembly.  The youth of the prisoner, hisbeauty and innocent looks, the mild, lamblike manner in which he hadconducted himself during the trial--all, all had thoroughly enlistedthe sympathy of the spectators, the ladies in particular.  And eventhe Jury, who had found it to be their stern duty to declare himguilty of the appalling crime--even the Jury now wept aloud at thisawful moment."Have you anything to say?" repeated the deeply moved Judge."Why, no," replied the prisoner, "I think I haven't, though I hopeyer Honor will show some consideration FOR THE FEELINGS OF A POORORPHAN!"The Judge sentenced the perfect young wretch without delay.1.36.  AFFAIRS AROUND THE VILLAGE GREEN.It isn't every one who has a village green to write about.  I haveone, although I have not seen much of it for some years past.  I amback again, now.  In the language of the duke who went around with amotto about him, "I am here!" and I fancy I am about as happy apeasant of the vale as ever garnished a melodrama, although I havenot as yet danced on my village green, as the melodramatic peasantusually does on his.  It was the case when Rosina Meadows left home.The time rolls by serenely now--so serenely that I don't care whattime it is, which is fortunate, because my watch is at present inthe hands of those "men of New York who are called rioters."  We metby chance, the usual way--certainly not by appointment--and Ibrought the interview to a close with all possible despatch.Assuring them that I wasn't Mr. Greeley, particularly, and that hehad never boarded in the private family where I enjoy the comfortsof a home, I tendered them my watch, and begged they woulddistribute it judiciously among the laboring classes, as I had seenthe rioters styled in certain public prints.Why should I loiter feverishly in Broadway, stabbing the hissing hotair with the splendid gold-headed cane that was presented to me bythe citizens of Waukegan, Illinois, as a slight testimonial of theiresteem?  Why broil in my rooms?  You said to me, Mrs. Gloverson,when I took possession of these rooms, that no matter how warm itmight be, a breeze had a way of blowing into them, and that theywere, withal, quite countryfied; but I am bound to say, Mrs.Gloverson, that there was nothing about them that ever reminded me,in the remotest degree, of daisies or new-mown hay.  Thus, withsarcasm, do I smash the deceptive Gloverson.Why stay in New York when I had a village green?  I gave it up, thesame as I would an intricate conundrum--and, in short, I am here.Do I miss the glare and crash of the imperial thoroughfare?  Themilkman, the fiery, untamed omnibus horses, the soda fountains,Central Park, and those things?  Yes I do; and I can go on missing'em for quite a spell, and enjoy it.The village from which I write to you is small.  It does not containover forty houses, all told; but they are milk-white, with thegreenest of blinds, and for the most part are shaded with beautifulelms and willows.  To the right of us is a mountain--to the left alake.  The village nestles between.  Of course it does, I never reada novel in my life in which the villages didn't nestle.  Villagesinvariably nestle.  It is a kind of way they have.We are away from the cars.  The iron-horse, as my little sisteraptly remarks in her composition On Nature, is never heard to shriekin our midst; and on the whole I am glad of it.The villagers are kindly people.  They are rather incoherent on thesubject of the war, but not more so, perhaps, then are peopleelsewhere.  One citizen, who used to sustain a good character,subscribed for the Weekly New York Herald a few months since, andwent to studying the military maps in that well-known journal forthe fireside.  I need not inform you that his intellect now totters,and he has mortgaged his farm.  In a literary point of view we arerather bloodthirsty.  A pamphlet edition of the life of a cheerfulbeing, who slaughtered his wife and child, and then finishedhimself, is having an extensive sale just now.We know little of Honore de Balzac, and perhaps care less for VictorHugo.  M. Claes's grand search for the Absolute doesn't thrill us inthe least; and Jean Valjean, gloomily picking his way through thesewers of Paris, with the spooney young man of the name of Mariusupon his back, awakens no interest in our breasts.  I say JeanValjean picked his way gloomily, and I repeat it.  No man, underthese circumstances, could have skipped gayly.  But this literarybusiness, as the gentleman who married his colored chambermaid aptlyobserved, "is simply a matter of taste."The store--I must not forget the store.  It is an object of greatinterest to me.  I usually encounter there, on sunny afternoons, anold Revolutionary soldier.  You may possibly have read about"Another Revolutionary Soldier gone," but this is one who hasn'tgone, and, moreover, one who doesn't manifest the slightestintention of going.  He distinctly remembers Washington, of course;they all do; but what I wish to call special attention to, is thefact that this Revolutionary soldier is one hundred years old, thathis eyes are so good that he can read fine print without spectacles--he never used them, by the way--and his mind is perfectly clear.He is a little shaky in one of his legs, but otherwise he is asactive as most men of forty-five, and his general health isexcellent.  He uses no tobacco, but for the last twenty years he hasdrunk one glass of liquor every day--no more, no less.  He says hemust have his tod.  I had begun to have lurking suspicions aboutthis Revolutionary soldier business, but here is an original Jacobs.But because a man can drink a glass of liquor a day, and live to bea hundred years old, my young readers must not infer that bydrinking two glasses of liquor a day a man can live to be twohundred.  "Which, I meanter say, it doesn't foller," as JosephGargery might observe.This store, in which may constantly be found calico and nails, andfish, and tobacco in kegs, and snuff in bladders, is a venerableestablishment.  As long ago as 1814 it was an institution.  Thecounty troops, on their way to the defence of Portland, then menacedby British ships-of-war, were drawn up in front of this very store,and treated at the town's expense.  Citizens will tell you how theclergyman refused to pray for the troops, because he considered thewar an unholy one; and how a somewhat eccentric person, of dissolutehabits, volunteered his services, stating that he once had an unclewho was a deacon, and he thought he could make a tolerable prayer,although it was rather out of his line; and how he prayed so longand absurdly that the Colonel ordered him under arrest, but thateven while soldiers stood over him with gleaming bayonets, thereckless being sang a preposterous song about his grandmother'sspotted calf, with its Ri-fol-lol-tiddery-i-do; after which hehowled dismally.And speaking of the store, reminds me of a little story.  The authorof "several successful comedies" has been among us, and the storewas anxious to know who the stranger was.  And therefore the storeasked him."What do you follow, sir?" respectfully inquired the tradesman."I occasionally write for the stage, sir.""Oh!" returned the tradesman, in a confused manner."He means," said an honest villager, with a desire to help thepuzzled tradesman out, "he means that he writes the handbills forthe stage drivers!"I believe that story is new, although perhaps it is not of anuproariously mirthful character; but one hears stories at the storethat are old enough, goodness knows--stories which, no doubt,diverted Methuselah in the sunny days of his giddy and thoughtlessboyhood.There is an exciting scene at the store occasionally.  Yesterday anathletic peasant, in a state of beer, smashed in a counter andemptied two tubs of butter on the floor.  His father--a white-hairedold man, who was a little boy when the Revolutionary war closed, butwho doesn't remember Washington MUCH, came round in the evening andsettled for the damages.  "My son," he said, "has considerableoriginality."  I will mention that this same son once told me thathe could lick me with one arm tied behind him, and I was sothoroughly satisfied he could, that I told him he needn't mind goingfor a rope.Sometimes I go a-visiting to a farmhouse, on which occasions theparlor is opened.  The windows have been close-shut ever since thelast visitor was there, and there is a dingy smell that I struggleas calmly as possible with, until I am led to the banquet ofsteaming hot biscuit and custard pie.  If they would only let me sitin the dear old-fashioned kitchen, or on the door-stone--if theyknew how dismally the new black furniture looked--but, never mind, Iam not a reformer.  No, I should rather think not.Gloomy enough, this living on a farm, you perhaps say, in which caseyou are wrong.  I can't exactly say that I pant to be anagriculturist, but I do know that in the main it is an independent,calmly happy sort of life.  I can see how the prosperous farmer cango joyously a-field with the rise of the sun, and how his heart mayswell with pride over bounteous harvests and sleek oxen.  And itmust be rather jolly for him on winter evenings to sit before thebright kitchen fire and watch his rosy boys and girls as they studyout the charades in the weekly paper, and gradually find out why myfirst is something that grows in a garden, and my second is a fish.On the green hillside over yonder there is a quivering of snowydrapery, and bright hair is flashing in the morning sunlight.  Itis recess, and the Seminary girls are running in the tall grass.A goodly seminary to look at outside, certainly, although I ampained to learn, as I do on unprejudiced authority, that Mrs.Higgins, the Principal, is a tyrant, who seeks to crush the girlsand trample upon them; but my sorrow is somewhat assuaged bylearning that Skimmerhorn, the pianist, is perfectly splendid.Looking at these girls reminds me that I, too, was once young--andwhere are the friends of my youth?  I have found one of 'em,certainly.  I saw him ride in the circus the other day on a barebackhorse, and even now his name stares at me from yonder board-fence,in green, and blue, and red, and yellow letters.  Dashington, theyouth with whom I used to read the able orations of Cicero, and who,as a declaimer on exhibition days, used to wipe the rest of us boyspretty handsomely out--well, Dashington is identified with thehalibut and cod interest--drives a fish cart, in fact, from acertain town on the coast, back into the interior.  Hurbertson, theutterly stupid boy--the lunkhead, who never had his lesson--he'sabout the ablest lawyer a sister State can boast.  Mills is anewspaper man, and is just now editing a Major-General down South.Singlinson, the sweet-voiced boy, whose face was always washed andwho was real good, and who was never rude--HE is in the penitentiaryfor putting his uncle's autograph to a financial document.  Hawkins,the clergyman's son, is an actor, and Williamson, the good littleboy who divided his bread and butter with the beggarman, is afailing merchant, and makes money by it.  Tom Slink, who used tosmoke short-sixes and get acquainted with the little circus boys, ispopularly supposed to be the proprietor of a cheap gamingestablishment in Boston, where the beautiful but uncertain prop isnightly tossed.  Be sure, the Army is represented by many of thefriends of my youth, the most of whom have given a good account ofthemselves.  But Chalmerson hasn't done much.  No, Chalmerson israther of a failure.  He plays on the guitar and sings love songs.Not that he is a bad man.  A kinder-hearted creature never lived,and they say he hasn't yet got over crying for his little curlyhaired sister who died ever so long ago.  But he knows nothing aboutbusiness, politics, the world, and those things.  He is dull attrade--indeed, it is a common remark that "everybody cheatsChalmerson."  He came to the party the other evening, and broughthis guitar.  They wouldn't have him for a tenor in the opera,certainly, for he is shaky in his upper notes; but if his simplemelodies didn't gush straight from the heart, why were my trainedeyes wet?  And although some of the girls giggled, and some of themen seemed to pity him I could not help fancying that poorChalmerson was nearer heaven than any of us all!1.37.  ABOUT EDITORS.We hear a great deal, and something too much, about the poverty ofeditors. It is common for editors to parade their poverty and jokeabout it in their papers.  We see these witticisms almost every dayof our lives.  Sometimes the editor does the "vater vorks business,"as Mr. Samuel Weller called weeping, and makes pathetic appeals tohis subscribers.  Sometimes he is in earnest when he makes theseappeals, but why "on airth" does he stick to a business that willnot support him decently?  We read of patriotic and lofty-mindedindividuals who sacrifice health, time, money, and perhaps life, forthe good of humanity, the Union, and that sort of thing, but wedon't SEE them very often.  We must say that we could count up allthe lofty patriots in this line that we have ever seen, during ourbrief but chequered and romantic career, in less than half a day.  Aman who clings to a wretchedly paying business, when he can makehimself and others near and dear to him fatter and happier by doingsomething else, is about as near an ass as possible, and not hankerafter green grass and corn in the ear.  The truth is, editors as aclass are very well fed, groomed and harnessed.  They have somepains that other folk do not have, and they also have someprivileges which the community in general can't possess.  While wewould not advise the young reader to "go for an editor," we assurehim he can do much worse.  He mustn't spoil a flourishing blacksmithor popular victualler in making an indifferent editor of himself,however.  He must be endowed with some fancy and imagination toenchain the public eye.  It was Smith, we believe, or some other manwith an odd name, who thought Shakespeare lacked the requisite fancyand imagination for a successful editor.To those persons who can't live by printing papers we would say, inthe language of the profligate boarder when dunned for his bill,being told at the same time by the keeper of the house that hecouldn't board people for nothing, "Then sell out to somebody whocan!"  In other words, fly from a business which don't remunerate.But as we intimated before, there is much gammon in the populareditorial cry of poverty.Just now we see a touching paragraph floating through the papers tothe effect that editors don't live out half their years; that, poorsouls! they wear themselves out for the benefit of a cold andunappreciating world.  We don't believe it.  Gentle reader, don'tswallow it.  It is a footlight trick to work on your feelings.  Forourselves, let us say, that unless we slip up considerably on ourcalculations, it will be a long time before our fellow-citizens willhave the melancholy pleasure of erecting to our memory a toweringmonument of Parian marble on the Public Square.1.38.  EDITING.Before you go for an Editor, young man, pause and take a big think!Do not rush into the editorial harness rashly.  Look around and seeif there is not an omnibus to drive--some soil somewhere to betilled--a clerkship on some meat cart to be filled--anything that isreputable and healthy, rather than going for an Editor, which ishard business at best.We are not a horse, and consequently have never been called upon tofurnish the motive power for a threshing-machine; but we fancy thatthe life of the Editor who is forced to write, write, write, whetherhe feels right or not, is much like that of the steed in question.If the yeas and neighs could be obtained, we believe the intelligenthorse would decide that the threshing-machine is preferable to thesanctum editorial.The Editor's work is never done.  He is drained incessantly, and nowonder that he dries up prematurely.  Other people can attendbanquets, weddings, &c.; visit halls of dazzling light, getinebriated, break windows, lick a man occasionally, and enjoythemselves in a variety of ways; but the Editor cannot.  He muststick tenaciously to his quill.  The press, like a sick baby,mustn't be left alone for a minute.  If the press is left to runitself even for a day, some absurd person indignantly orders thecarrier-boy to stop bringing "that infernal paper.  There's nothingin it.  I won't have it in the house!"The elegant Mantalini, reduced to mangle-turning, described his lifeas "a dem'd horrid grind."  The life of the Editor is all of that.But there is a good time coming, we feel confident, for the Editor.A time when he will be appreciated.  When he will have a front seat.When he will have pie every day, and wear store clothes continually.When the harsh cry of "stop my paper" will no more grate upon hisears.  Courage, Messieurs the Editors!  Still, sanguine as we are ofthe coming of this jolly time, we advise the aspirant for editorialhonors to pause ere he takes up the quill as a means of obtaininghis bread and butter.  Do not, at least, do so until you have beenjilted several dozen times by a like number of girls; until you havebeen knocked down-stairs several times and soused in a horse-pond;until all the "gushing" feelings within you have been thoroughlysubdued; until, in short, your hide is of rhinoceros thickness.Then, O aspirants for the bubble reputation at the press's mouth,throw yourselves among the inkpots, dust, and cobwebs of theprinting office, if you will.  *  *  *  Good my lord, will you see the Editors well bestowed?  Doyou hear, let them be well used, for they are the abstract and briefchroniclers of the time.  After your death you had better have a badepitaph than their ill report while you live.                                           Hamlet, slightly altered.1.39.  POPULARITY.What a queer thing is popularity; Bill Pug Nose of the "Plug-Uglies"(The name given to an infamous gang of ruffians which once had itshead-quarters in Baltimore.) acquires a world-wide reputation bysmashing up the "champion of light weights," sets up a Saloon uponit, and realizes the first month; while our Missionary, whocollected two hundred blankets last August, and at that time saved alike number of little negroes in the West Indies from freezing, hasreceived nothing but the yellow fever.  The Hon. Oracular M.Matterson becomes able to withstand any quantity of late nights andbad brandy, is elected to Congress, and lobbies through contracts bywhich he realizes some 50,000 dollars; while private individualslose 100,000 dollars by the Atlantic Cable.  Contracts are popular--the cable isn't.  Fiddlers, Prima Donnas, Horse Operas, learnedpigs, and five-legged calves travel through the country, reaping"golden opinions," while editors, inventors, professors, andhumanitarians generally, are starving in garrets.  Revivals ofreligion, fashions, summer resorts, and pleasure trips, areexceedingly popular, while trade, commerce, chloride of lime, andall the concomitants necessary to render the inner life of denizensof cities tolerable, are decidedly non est.  Even water, which wasso popular and populous a few weeks agone, comes to us in suchstinted sprinklings that it has become popular to supply it onlyfrom hydrants in sufficient quantities to raise one hundreddisgusting smells in a distance of two blocks.  Monsieur Revierre,with nothing but a small name and a large quantity of hair, makeshimself exceedingly popular with hotel-keepers and a numerousprogeny of female Flaunts and Blounts, while Felix Smooth and Mr.Chink, who persistently set forth their personal and moresubstantial marital charms through the columns of "New York Herald,"have only received one interview each--one from a man in femaleattire, and the other from the keeper of an unmentionable house.Popularity is a queer thing, very.  If you don't believe us, try it!1.40.  A LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN THE WAY.An enterprising traveling agent for a well-known Cleveland TombstoneManufactory lately made a business visit to a small town in anadjoining county.  Hearing, in the village, that a man in a remotepart of the township had lost his wife, he thought he would go andsee him, and offer him consolation and a gravestone, on his usualreasonable terms.  He started.  The road was a frightful one, butthe agent persevered, and finally arrived at the bereaved man'shouse.  Bereaved man's hired girl told the agent that the bereavedman was splitting fence rails "over in pastur, about two milds."The indefatigable agent hitched his horse and started for the"pastur."  After falling into all manner of mudholes, scratchinghimself with briers, and tumbling over decayed logs, the agent atlength found the bereaved man.  In a subdued voice he asked the manif he had lost his wife.  The man said he had.  The agent was verysorry to hear of it, and sympathized with the man deeply in hisgreat affliction; but death, he said, was an insatiate archer, andshot down all, both of high and low degree.  Informed the man that"what was his loss was her gain," and would be glad to sell him agravestone to mark the spot where the beloved one slept--marble orcommon stone, as he chose, at prices defying competition.  Thebereaved man said there was "a little difficulty in the way.""Haven't you lost your wife?" inquired the agent."Why, yes, I have," said the man, "but no gravestun ain't necessary:you see the cussed critter ain't dead.  SHE'S SCOOTED WITH ANOTHERMAN!"The agent retired.1.41.  COLORED PEOPLE'S CHURCH.There is a plain little meeting-house on Barnwell Street (One of thestreets of the city of Cleveland.) in which the colored people--or agoodly portion of them--worship on Sundays.  The seats arecushionless, and have perpendicular backs.  The pulpit is plainwhite--trimmed with red, it is true, but still a very unostentatiousaffair for colored people, who are supposed to have a decidedweakness for gay hues.  Should you escort a lady to this church, andseat yourself beside her, you will infallibly be touched on theshoulder, and politely requested to move to the "gentlemen's side."Gentlemen and ladies are not allowed to sit together in this church.They are parted remorselessly.  It is hard--we may say it isterrible--to be torn asunder in this way, but you have to submit,and of course you had better do so gracefully and pleasantly.Meeting opens with an old-fashioned hymn, which is very well sungindeed by the congregation.  Then the minister reads a hymn, whichis sung by the choir on the front seats near the pulpit.  Then theminister prays.  He hopes no one has been attracted there by idlecuriosity--to see or be seen--and you naturally conclude that he isgently hitting you.  Another hymn follows the prayer, and then wehave the discourse, which certainly has the merit of peculiarity andboldness.  The minister's name is Jones.  He don't mince matters atall.  He talks about the "flames of hell" with a confidentfierceness that must be quite refreshing to sinners."There's no half-way about this," says he, "no by-paths."There are in Cleveland lots of men who go to church regularly, whobehave well in meeting, and who pay their bills."They ain't Christians though."They're gentlemen sinners."And whar d'ye spose they'll fetch up?"I'll tell ye--they'll fetch him up in h--ll, and they'll come upstanding too--there's where they'll fetch up."Who's my backer?"Have I got a backer?"Whar's my backer?"This is my backer (striking the Bible before him)--the Bible willback me to any amount!"To still further convince his hearers that he was in earnest, heexclaimed, "That's me--that's Jones!"He alluded to Eve in terms of bitter censure.  It was natural thatAdam should have been mad at her.  "I shouldn't want a woman thatwouldn't mind me, myself," said the speaker.He directed his attention to dancing, declaring it to be a greatsin.  Whar there's dancing there's fiddling--whar there's fiddlingthere's unrighteousness, and unrighteousness is wickedness, andwickedness is sin!  That's me--that's Jones."Bosom the speaker invariably called "buzzim," and devil "debil,"with a fearfully strong accent on the "il."1.42.  SPIRITS.Mr. Davenport (One of the afterwards notorious Davenport Brothers.),who has been for some time closely identified with the modernspiritual movement, is in the city with his daughter, who is quitecelebrated as a medium.  They are accompanied by Mr. Eighme and hisdaughter, and are holding circles in Hoffman's Block every afternoonand evening.  We were present at the circle last evening.  MissDavenport seated herself at a table on which was a tin trumpet, atambourine, and a guitar.  The audience were seated around the room.The lights were blown out, and the spirit of an eccentricindividual, well known to the Davenports, and whom they call George,addressed the audience through the trumpet.  He called several ofthose present by name in a boisterous voice, and dealt severalstunning knocks on the table.  George has been in the spirit-worldsome two hundred years.  He is a rather rough spirit, and probablyrun with the machine and "killed for Kyser" when in the flesh.(Kyser is an extensive New York butcher, and "to kill" [orslaughter] for him has passed into a saying with the roughs, or"bhoys," of New York.  To "run with a [fire] machine.")  He orderedthe seats in the room to be wheeled round so the audience would facethe table.  He said the people on the front seat must be tied with arope.  The order was misunderstood, the rope being merely drawnbefore those on the front seat.  He reprimanded Mr. Davenport fornot understanding the instructions.  What he meant was that the ropeshould be passed around each person on the front seat and thentightly drawn, a man at each end of the seat to hold on to it.  Thiswas done, and George expressed himself satisfied.  There was no onenear the table save the medium.  All the rest were behind the rope,and those on the front seat were particularly charged not to let anyone pass by them.  George said he felt first-rate, and commencedkissing the ladies present.  The smack could be distinctly heard,and some of the ladies said the sensation was very natural.  For thefirst time in our eventful life we sighed to be a spirit. We enviedGeorge.  We did not understand whether the kissing was done througha trumpet.  After kissing considerably, and indulging in someplayful remarks with a man whose Christian name was NapoleonBonaparte, and whom George called "Boney," he tied the hands andfeet of the medium.  He played the guitar and jingled thetambourine, and then dashed them violently on the floor.  Thecandles were lit, and Miss Davenport was securely tied.  She couldnot move her hands.  Her feet were bound, and the rope (which was along one) was fastened to the chair.  No person in the room had beennear her or had anything to do with tying her.  Every person who wasin the room will take his or her oath of that.  She could hardlyhave tied herself.  We never saw such intricate and thorough tyingin our life.  The believers present were convinced that George didit.  The unbelievers didn't exactly know what to think about it.The candles were extinguished again, and pretty soon Miss Davenporttold George to "don't."  She spoke in an affrighted tone.  Thecandles were lit, and she was discovered sitting on the table--handsand feet tied as before, and herself tied to the chair withal.  Thelights were again blown out, there were sounds as if some one waslifting her from the table; the candles were relit, and she was seensitting in the chair on the floor again.  No one had been near herfrom the audience.  Again the lights were extinguished, andpresently the medium said her feet were wet.  It appeared that themischievous spirit of one Biddie, an Irish Miss who died when twelveyears old, had kicked over the water-pail.  Miss Eighme took a seatat the table, and the same mischievous Biddie scissored off a liberallock of her hair.  There was the hair, and it had indisputably justbeen taken from Miss Eighme's head, and her hands and feet, likethose of Miss D., were securely tied.  Other things of a staggeringcharacter to the sceptic were done during the evening.1.43.  MR. BLOWHARD.The reader has probably met Mr. Blowhard.  He is usually round.  Youfind him in all public places.  He is particularly "numerous" atshows.  Knows all the actors intimately.  Went to school with someof 'em.  Knows how much they get a month to a cent, and how muchliquor they can hold to a teaspoonful.  He knows Ned Forrest like abook.  Has taken sundry drinks with Ned.  Ned likes him much.  Iswell acquainted with a certain actress. Could have married her justas easy as not if he had wanted to.  Didn't like her "style," and soconcluded not to marry her.  Knows Dan Rice well. Knows all of hismen and horses.  Is on terms of affectionate intimacy with Dan'srhinoceros, and is tolerably well acquainted with the performingelephant.  We encountered Mr. Blowhard at the circus yesterday.  Hewas entertaining those near him with a full account of the wholeinstitution, men, boys, horses, "muils" and all.  He said therhinoceros was perfectly harmless, as his teeth had all been takenout in infancy.  Besides, the rhinoceros was under the influence ofopium while he was in the ring, which entirely prevented hisinjuring anybody.  No danger whatever.  In due course of time theamiable beast was led into the ring.  When the cord was taken fromhis nose, he turned suddenly and manifested a slight desire to runviolently in among some boys who were seated near the musicians.The keeper, with the assistance of one of the Bedouin Arabs, sooninduced him to change his mind, and got him in the middle of thering.  The pleasant quadruped had no sooner arrived here than hehastily started, with a melodious bellow, towards the seats on oneof which sat Mr. Blowhard.  Each particular hair on Mr. Blowhard'shead stood up "like squills upon the speckled porkupine" (Shakspeareor Artemus Ward, we forget which), and he fell, with a small shriek,down through the seats to the ground.  He remained there until theagitated rhinoceros became calm, when he crawled slowly back to hisseat."Keep mum," he said, with a very wise shake of the head "I onlywanted to have some fun with them folks above us.  I swar, I'll betthe whisky they thought I was scared!"  Great character thatBlowhard.1.44.  MARKET MORNING.                "Hurrah! this is market day,                 Up, lads, and gaily away!"--Old Comedy.On market mornings there is a roar and a crash all about the cornerof Kinsman and Pittsburg Streets.  The market building--so called,we presume, because it don't in the least resemble a marketbuilding--is crowded with beef and butchers, and almost countlessmeat and vegetable wagons, of all sorts, are confusedly huddledtogether all around outside.  These wagons mostly come from a fewmiles out of town, and are always on the spot at daybreak.  A littleafter sunrise the crash and jam commences, and continues with littlecessation until ten o'clock in the forenoon.  There is a babel oftongues, an excessively cosmopolitan gathering of people, a roar ofwheels, and a lively smell of beef and vegetables.  The soap man,the headache curative man, the razor man, and a variety of othertolerable humbugs, are in full blast.  We meet married men withbaskets in their hands.  Those who have been fortunate in theirselections look happy, while some who have been unlucky wear adejected air, for they are probably destined to get pieces of theirwives' minds on their arrival home.  It is true, that all marriedmen have their own way, but the trouble is they don't all have theirown way of having it!  We meet a newly-married man.  He has recentlyset up housekeeping.  He is out to buy steak for breakfast.  Thereare only himself and wife and female domestic in the family.  Heshows us his basket, which contains steak enough for at least tenable-bodied men.  We tell him so, but he says we don't know anythingabout war, and passes on.  Here comes a lady of high degree, who hasno end of servants to send to the market, but she likes to comeherself, and it won't prevent her shining and sparkling in herelegant drawing-room this afternoon.  And she is accumulating muscleand freshness of face by these walks to market.And here IS a charming picture.  Standing beside a vegetable cart isa maiden beautiful and sweeter far than any daisy in the fields.Eyes of purest blue, lips of cherry red, teeth like pearls, silken,golden hair, and form of exquisite mould.  We wonder if she is afairy, but instantly conclude that she is not, for in measuring outa peck of onions she spills some of them; a small boy laughs at themishap, and she indignantly shies the measure at his head.  Fairies,you know, don't throw peck measures at small boys' heads.  The spellwas broken.  The golden chain which for a moment bound us fell topieces.  We meet an eccentric individual in corduroy pantaloons andpepper-and-salt coat, who wants to know if we didn't sail out ofNantucket in 1852 in the whaling brig "Jasper Green."  We arecompelled to confess that the only nautical experience we ever hadwas to once temporarily command a canal boat on the dark-rollingWabash, while the captain went ashore to cave in the head of amiscreant who had winked lasciviously at the sylph who superintendedthe culinary department on board that gallant craft.  The eccentricindividual smiles in a ghastly manner, says perhaps we won't lendhim a dollar till tomorrow; to which we courteously reply that weCERTAINLY won't, and he glides away.We return to our hotel, reinvigorated with the early, healthfuljaunt, and bestow an imaginary purse of gold upon our AfricanBrother, who brings us a hot and excellent breakfast.1.45.  WE SEE TWO WITCHES.Two female fortune-tellers recently came hither, and spread "smallbills" throughout the city.  Being slightly anxious, in common witha wide circle of relatives and friends, to know where we were goingto, and what was to become of us, we visited both of these eminentlyrespectable witches yesterday and had our fortune told "twict."Physicians sometimes disagree, lawyers invariably do, editorsoccasionally fall out, and we are pained to say that even witchesunfold different tales to one individual.  In describing ourinterviews with these singularly gifted female women, who areactually and positively here in this city, we must speakconsiderably of "we"--not because we flatter ourselves that we aremore interesting than people in general, but because in the presentcase it is really necessary. In the language of Hamlet's Pa, "List,O list!"We went to see "Madame B." first.  She has rooms at the BurnettHouse.  The following is a copy of her bill:--                           MADAME B.,         THE CELEBRATED SPANISH ASTROLOGIST, CLAIRVOYANT                     AND FEMALE DOCTRESS, Would respectfully announce to the citizens that she has just arrived in this city, and designs remaining for a few days only. The Madame can be consulted on all matters pertaining to life-- either past, present, or future--tracing the line of life from Infancy to Old Age, particularizing each event, in regard to  Business, Love, Marriage, Courtship, Losses, Law Matters, and      Sickness of Relatives and Friends at a distance. The Madame will also show her visitors a life-like representation              of their Future Husbands and Wives.                  LUCKY NUMBERS IN LOTTERIES Can also be selected by her, and hundreds who have consulted her have drawn capital prizes.  The Madame will furnish medicine for all diseases, for grown persons (male or female) and children. Persons wishing to consult her concerning this mysterious art and human destiny, particularly with reference to their own individualbearing in relation to a supposed Providence, can be accommodated by                  ROOM NO. 23, BURNETT HOUSE,          Corner of Prospect and Ontario streets, Cleveland.The Madame has traveled extensively for the last few years, both inthe United States and the West Indies, and the success which hasattended her in all places has won for her the reputation of beingthe most wonderful Astrologist of the present age.The Madame has a superior faculty for this business, having beenborn with a Caul on her Face, by virtue of which she can moreaccurately read the past, present, and future; also enabling her tocure many diseases without using drugs or medicines.  The madameadvertises nothing but what she can do.  Call on her if you wouldconsult the greatest Foreteller of events now living.        Hours of Consultation, from 8 A.M. to 9 o'clock P.M.We urbanely informed the lady with the "Caul on her Face" that wehad called to have our fortune told, and she said, "Hand out yourmoney."  This preliminary being settled, Madame B. (who is a tall,sharp-eyed, dark-featured and angular woman, dressed in painfullypositive colors, and heavily loaded with gold chain and mammothjewelry of various kinds) and Jupiter indicated powerful that wewere a slim constitution, which came down on to us from our father'sside.  Wherein our constitution was not slim, so it came down on tous from our mother's side."Is this so?"And we said it was."Yes," continued the witch, "I know'd 'twas.  You can't deceiveJupiter, me, nor any other planick.  You may swim same as Leanderdid, but you can't deceive the planicks.  Give me your hand!  Timesain't so easy as they has been.  So--so--but 'tis temp'ry.  'Twon'tlast long.  Times will be easy soon.  You may be tramped on to onctor twict, but you'll rekiver.  You have talenk, me child.  You kinmake a Congresser if sich you likes to be. [We said we would beexcused, if it was all the same to her.]  You kin be a lawyer.  [Wethanked her, but said we would rather retain our present good moralcharacter.]  You kin be a soldier.  You have courage enough to go tothe Hostrian wars and kill the French.  [We informed her that we hadalready murdered some "English."]  You won't have much money tillyou're thirty-three years of old.  Then you will have large sums--forty thousand dollars, perhaps.  Look out for it!  [We promised wewould.]  You have traveled some, and you will travel more, whichwill make your travels more extensiver than they has been.  You willgo to Californy by way of Pike's Pick.  [Same route taken by HoraceGreeley.]  If nothin happens onto you, you won't meet with noaccidents and will get through pleasant, which you otherwise willnot do under all circumstances however, which doth happen to all,both great and small, likewise to the rich as also the poor.Hearken to me!  There has been deaths in your family, and there willbe more!  But Reserve your constitution and you will live to beseventy years of old.  Me child, HER hair will be black--black asthe Raving's wing.  Likewise black will also be her eyes, and she'llbe as different from which you air as night and day.  Look out forthe darkish man!  He's yer rival!  Beware of the darkish man!  [Wepromised that we'd introduce a funeral into the "darkish man's"family the moment we encountered him.]  Me child, there's moresunshine than clouds for ye, and send all your friends up here."A word before you goes.  Expose not yourself.  Your eyes is saller,which is on accounts of bile on your systim.  Some don't have bileon to their systims which their eyes is not saller.  This bileascends down on to you from many generations which is in theirgraves, and peace to their ashes."                          MADAME CROMPTON.We then proceeded directly to Madame Crompton, the other fortune-teller.Below is her bill:--                        MADAME R. CROMPTON,             The World-Renowned Fortune-Teller and                          Astrologist.  Madame Crompton begs leave to inform the citizens of Cleveland         and vicinity that she has taken rooms at the                     FARMERS' ST CLAIR HOUSE,              Corner of St Clair and Water Streets,      Where she may be consulted on all matters pertaining to                    Past and Future Events.        Also giving Information of Absent friends, whether                      Living or Dead.  P.S.--Persons having lost or having property stolen of any kind,  will do well to give her a call, as she will describe the person or  persons with such accuracy as will astonish the most devout critic.                        Terms Reasonable.She has rooms at the Farmers' Hotel, as stated in the bill above.She was driving an extensive business, and we were forced to waithalf an hour or so for a chance to see her.  Madame Crompton is ofthe English persuasion, and has evidently searched many long yearsin vain for her H.  She is small in stature, but considerablyinclined to corpulency, and her red round face is continuallywreathed in smiles, reminding one of a new tin pan basking in thenoonday sun.  She took a greasy pack of common playing cards, andrequested us to "cut them in three," which we did. She spread themout before her on the table, and said:--"Sir to you which I speaks.  You 'av been terrible crossed in love,and your 'art 'as been much panged.  But you'll get over it andmarry a light complected gale with rayther reddish 'air.  Beforesome time you'll have a legercy fall down on to you, mostly insolick Jold.  There may be a lawsuit about it, and you may besup-prisoned as a witnesses, but you'll git it--mostly in solickJold, which you will keep in chists, and you must look out for them.[We said we would keep a skinned optic on "them chists."]  You 'as aenemy, and he's a lightish man.  He wants to defraud you out of your'onesty.  He is tellink lies about you now in the 'opes of crushinyourself.  [A weak invention of "the opposition."]  You never didnothin bad.  Your 'art is right.  You 'ave a great taste for hossesand like to stay with 'em.  Mister to you I sez:  Gard aginst thelightish man and all will be well."The supernatural being then took an oval-shaped chunk of glass(which she called a stone) and requested us to "hang on to it."  Shelooked into it and said:"If you're not keerful when you git your money, you'll lose it, butwhich otherwise you will not, and fifty cents is as cheap as I kinafford to tell anybody's fortune, and no great shakes made then."1.46.  FROM A HOMELY MAN.Dear Plain Dealer,--I am a plain man, and there is a melancholyfitness in my unbosoming my sufferings to the "Plain" Dealer.  Plainas you may be in your dealings, however, I am convinced you neverbefore had to DEAL with a correspondent so hopelessly plain as I.Yet plain don't half express my looks.  Indeed I doubt very muchwhether any word in the English language could be found to convey anadequate idea on my absolute and utter homeliness.  The dates in theold family Bible show that I am in the decline of life, but I cannotrecall a period in my existence when I felt really young.  My veryinfancy, those brief months when babes prattle joyously and knownothing of care, was darkened by a shadowy presentiment of what Iwas to endure through life, and my youth was rendered dismal bycontinued repetitions of a fact painfully evident "on the face ofit," that the boy was growing homelier and homelier every day.Memory, that with other people recalls so much that is sweet andpleasant to think of in connection with their youth, with me bringsup nothing but mortification, bitter tears, I had almost saidcurses, on my solitary and homely lot.  I have wished--a thousandtimes wished--that Memory had never consented to take a seat "inthis distracted globe."You have heard of a man so homely that he couldn't sleep nights, hisface ached so.  Mr. Editor, I am that melancholy individual.Whoever perpetrated the joke--for joke it was no doubt intended tobe--knew not how much truth he was uttering, or how bitterly theidle squib would rankle in the heart of one suffering man.  Many andmany a night have I in my childhood laid awake thinking of myhomeliness, and as the moonlight has streamed in at the window andfell upon the handsome and placid features of my little brotherslumbering at my side, Heaven forgive me for the wicked thought, butI have felt an almost unconquerable impulse to forever disfigure andmar that sweet upturned innocent face that smiled and looked sobeautiful in sleep, for it was ever reminding me of the curse I wasdoomed to carry about me.  Many and many a night have I got up in mynightdress, and lighting my little lamp, sat for hours gazing at myterrible ugliness of face reflected in the mirror, drawn to it by acruel fascination which it was impossible for me to resist.I need not tell you that I am a single man, and yet I have had whatmen call affairs of the heart.  I have known what it is to worshipthe heart's embodiment of female loveliness, and purity, and truth,but it was generally at a distance entirely safe to the object of myadoration.  Being of a susceptible nature, I was continually fallingin love, but never, save with one single exception, did I venture todeclare my flame.  I saw my heart's palpitator walking in a grove.Moved by my consuming love, I rushed towards her, and throwingmyself at her feet began to pour forth the long-pent-up emotions ofmy heart.  She gave one look and then             "Shrieked till all the rocks replied;"at least you'd thought they replied if you had seen me leave thatgrove with a speed greatly accelerated by a shower of rocks from thehands of an enraged brother, who was at hand.  That prepossessingyoung lady is now slowly recovering her reason in an institution forthe insane.Of my further troubles I may perhaps inform you at some future time.                                                       Homely Man.1.47.  THE ELEPHANT.Some two years since, on the strength of what we regarded asreliable information, we announced the death of the elephantHannibal, at Canton, and accompanied the announcement with a shortsketch of that remarkable animal.  We happened to be familiar withseveral interesting incidents in the private life of Hannibal, andour sketch was copied by almost every paper in America and byseveral European journals.  A few months ago a "traveled" friendshowed us the sketch in a Parisian journal, and possibly it is"going the rounds" of the Chinese papers by this time.  A few daysafter we had printed his obituary Hannibal came to town with VanAmburgh's Menagerie, and the same type which killed the monsterrestored him to life again.About once a year Hannibal                  "Gets on a spree,                   And goes bobbin around."to make a short quotation from a once popular ballad.  These sprees,in fact, "is what's the matter with him."The other day, in Williamsburg, Long Island, he broke loose in thecanvas, emptied most of the cages, and tore through the town like amammoth pestilence.  An extensive crowd of athletic men, by jabbinghim with spears and pitchforks, and coiling big ropes around hislegs, succeeded in capturing him.  The animals he had set free werecaught and restored to their cages without much difficulty.We doubt if we shall ever forget our first view of Hannibal--whichwas also our first view of any elephant--of THE elephant, in short.It was at the close of a sultry day in June, 18--.  The sun hadspent its fury and was going to rest among the clouds of gold andcrimson.  A solitary horseman might have been seen slowly ascendinga long hill in a New England town.  That solitary horseman was us,and we were mounted on the old white mare.  Two bags were strappedto the foaming steed.  That was before we became wealthy, and ofcourse we are not ashamed to say that we had been to mill, andconsequently THEM bags contained flour and middlins.  Presently alarge object appeared at the top of the hill.  We had heard of thedevil, and had been pretty often told that he would have a cleardeed and title to us before long, but had never heard him paintedlike the object which met our gaze at the top of that hill on theclose of sultry day in June.  Concluding (for we were a mere youth)that it was an eccentric whale, who had come ashore near NorthYarmouth, and was making a tour through the interior on wheels, wehastily turned our steed and made for the mill at a rapid rate.Once we threw over ballast, after the manner of balloonists, and asthe object gained on us we cried aloud for our parents.  Fortunatelywe reached the mill in safety, and the object passed at a furiousrate, with a portion of a woodshed on its back.  It was Hannibal,who had run away from a neighboring town, taking a shed with him.                      .    .    .    .    .DRANK STANDIN.--Col. -- is a big "railroad man."  He attended arailroad supper once.  Champagne flowed freely, and the Colonel gotmore than his share.  Speeches were made after the removal of thecloth.  Somebody arose and eulogized the Colonel in the steepestpossible manner--called him great, good, patriotic, enterprising,&c., &c.  The speaker was here interrupted by the illustriousColonel himself, who arising with considerable difficulty, andbeaming benevolently around the table, gravely said, "Let's (hic)drink that sedimunt standin!"  It was done.1.48.  HOW THE NAPOLEON OF SELLERS WAS SOLD.We have read a great many stories of which Winchell, the great witand mimic, was the hero, showing always how neatly and entirely hesold somebody.  Any one who is familiar with Winchell's wonderfulpowers of mimicry cannot doubt that these stories are allsubstantially true.  But there is one instance which we will relate,or perish in the attempt, where the jolly Winchell was himself sold.The other evening, while he was conversing with several gentlemen atone of the hotels, a dilapidated individual reeled into the room andhalted in front of the stove, where he made wild and unsuccessfulefforts to maintain a firm position.  He evidently had spent theevening in marching torchlight processions of forty-rod whisky downhis throat, and at this particular time was decidedly anddisreputably drunk.  With a sly wink to the crowd, as much as tosay, "We'll have some fun with this individual," Winchell assumed asolemn face, and in a ghostly voice said to one of the company:"The poor fellow we were speaking of is dead!""No?" said the individual addressed."Yes," said Winchell; "you know both of his eyes were gouged out,his nose was chawed off, and both of his arms were torn out at theroots.  Of course, he could'nt recover."This was all said for the benefit of the drunken man, who wasstanding, or trying to stand, within a few feet of Winchell; but hetook no sort of notice of it, and was apparently ignorant of thecelebrated delineator's presence.  Again Winchell endeavored toattract his attention, but utterly failed as before.  In a fewmoments the drunken man staggered out of the room."I can generally have a little fun with a drunken man," saidWinchell, "but it is no go in this case.""I suppose you know what ails the man who just went out?" said the"gentlemanly host.""I perceive he is alarmingly inebriated," said Winchell; "doesanything else ail him?""Yes," said the host, "HE'S DEAF AND DUMB!"This was true.  There was a "larf," and Winchell, with the remarkthat he was sorry to see a disposition in that assemblage "todeceive an orphan," called for a light and went gravely to bed.1.49.  ON AUTUMN.Poets are wont to apostrophize the leafy month of June, and there isno denying that if Spring is "some," June is Summer.  But there is agorgeous magnificence about the habiliments of Nature, and a teemingfruitfulness upon her lap during the autumnal months, and we mustconfess we have always felt genially inclined towards this season.It is true, when we concentrate our field of vision to the minutegarniture of earth, we no longer observe the beautiful petals, norinhale the fragrance of a gay parterre of the "floral epistles" and"angel-like collections" which Longfellow (we believe) sographically describes, and which Shortfellows so fantastically carryabout in their buttonholes; but we have all their tints reproducedupon a higher and broader canvas in the kaleidoscopic colors withwhich the sky and the forest daily enchant us, and the beautiful andluscious fruits which Autumn spreads out before us, and         "Crowns the rich promise of the opening Spring."In another point of view Autumn is suggestive of pleasantreflections.  The wearying, wasting heat of Summer, and the deadlyblasts with which her breath has for some years been freighted, arepast, and the bracing north winds begin to bring balm and healing ontheir wings.  The hurly-burly of travel, and most sorts of publicity(except newspapers), are fast playing out, and we can once more hopeto see our friends and relations in the happy sociality of home andfireside enjoyments.  Yielding, as we do, the full force to whichAutumn is seriously entitled, or rather to the serious reflectionsand admonitions which the decay of Nature and the dying year alwaysinspire, and admitting the poet's decade--         "Leaves have their time to fall,          And stars to set,--but all,          Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death!"There is a brighter Autumn beyond, and brighter opening years tothose who choose them rather than dead leaves and bitter fruits.Thus we can conclude tranquilly with Bryant, as we began gaily withanother--         "So live, that when thy summons comes to join          The innumerable caravan, which moves          To that mysterious realm, where each shall take          His chamber in the silent halls of death,          Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,          Scourged to his dungeon; but, sustained and soothed          By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave          Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch          About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams."1.50.  PAYING FOR HIS PROVENDER BY PRAYING.We have no intention of making fun of serious matters in telling thefollowing story; we merely relate a fact.There is a rule at Oberlin College that no student shall board atany house where prayers are not regularly made each day.  A certainman fitted up a boarding-house and filled it with boarders, butforgot, until the eleventh hour, the prayer proviso.  Not being apraying man himself, he looked around for one who was.  At length hefound one--a meek young man from Trumbull County--who agreed to payfor his board in praying.  For a while all went smoothly, but theboarding-master furnished his table so poorly that the boardersbegan to grumble and to leave, and the other morning the prayingboarder actually "struck!"  Something like the following dialogueoccurred at the table:--LANDLORD.--Will you pray, Mr. Mild?MILD.--No, sir, I will not.LANDLORD.--Why not, Mr. Mild?MILD.--It don't pay, sir.  I can't pray on such victuals as these.And unless you bind yourself in writing to set a better table thanyou have for the last three weeks, NARY ANOTHER PRAYER YOU GET OUTOF ME!And that's the way the matter stood at latest advices.1.51.  HUNTING TROUBLE.Hunting trouble is too fashionable in this world.  Contentment andjollity are not cultivated as they should be.  There are too manyprematurely-wrinkled long and melancholy faces among us.  There istoo much swearing, sweating and slashing, fuming, foaming andfretting around and about us all.                 "A mad world, my masters."People rush outdoors bareheaded and barefooted, as it were, and dashblindly into all sorts of dark alleys in quest of all sorts ofTrouble, when, "Goodness knows," if they will only sit calmly andpleasantly by their firesides, Trouble will knock soon enough attheir doors.Hunting Trouble is bad business.  If we ever are induced to descendfrom our present proud position to become a member of theLegislature, or ever accumulate sufficient muscle, impudence, andtaste for bad liquor to go to Congress, we shall introduce "awilliam" for the suppression of Trouble-hunting.  We know MissSlinkins, who incessantly frets because Miss Slurkins is betterharnessed than she is, won't like it; and we presume the Simpkinses,who worry so much because the Perkinses live in a freestone-frontedhouse whilst theirs is only plain brick, won't like it also.  It isdoubtful, too, whether our long-haired friends the Reformers (whothink the machinery of the world is all out of joint, while we thinkit only needs a little greasing to run in first-rate style), willapprove the measure.  It is probable, indeed, that very manysocieties, of a reformatory (and inflammatory) character, wouldfrown upon the measure.  But the measure would be a good onenevertheless.Never hunt Trouble.  However dead a shot one may be, the gun hecarries on such expeditions is sure to kick or go off half-cocked.Trouble will come soon enough, and when he does come, receive him aspleasantly as possible. Like the tax-collector, he is a disagreeablechap to have in one's house, but the more amiably you greet him thesooner he will go away.1.52.  DARK DOINGS.Four promising young men of this city attended a ball in the ruraldistricts not long since.  At a late hour they retired, leaving wordwith the clerk of the hotel to call them early in the morning, asthey wanted to take the first train home.  The clerk was an oldfriend of the "fellers," and he thought he would have a slight jokeat their expense.  So he burnt some cork, and, with a sponge,blacked the faces of his city friends after they had got soundlyasleep.  In the morning he called them about ten minutes before thetrain came along.  Feller No. 1 awoke and laughed boisterously atthe sight which met his gaze.  But he saw through it--the clerk hadplayed his good joke on his three comrades, and of course he wouldkeep mum.  But it was a devilish good joke.  Feller No. 2 awoke, sawthe three black men in the room, comprehended the joke, and laughedvociferously.  But he would keep mum.  Fellers No. 3 and 4 awoke,and experienced the same pleasant feeling; and there was thebeautiful spectacle of four nice young men laughing heartily one atanother, each one supposing the "urban clerk" had spared him in hiscork-daubing operations.  They had only time to dress before thetrain arrived.  They all got aboard, each thinking what a gloriousjoke it was to have his three companions go back to town with blackfaces.  The idea was so rich that they all commenced laughingviolently as soon as they got aboard the cars.  The other passengerstook to laughing also, and fun raged fast and furious, until thebenevolent baggage-man, seeing how matters stood, brought a smallpocket-glass and handed it around to the young men.  They suddenlystopped laughing, rushed wildly for the baggage-car, washed theirfaces, and amused and instructed each other during the remainder ofthe trip with some eloquent flashes of silence.1.53.  REPORTERS.The following paragraph is going the rounds:--"How many a great manis now basking in the sunshine of fame generously bestowed upon himby the prolific genius of some reporter!  How many stupid orationshave been made brilliant, how many wandering, pointless, objectless,speeches put in form and rendered at least readable, by the unknownreporter!  How many a disheartened speaker, who was conscious thenight before of a failure, before a thin, cold, spiritless audience,awakes delighted to learn that he has addressed an overwhelmingassemblage of his enthusiastic, appreciating fellow-citizens, tofind his speech sparkling with 'cheers,' breaking out into 'immenseapplause,' and concluding amidst 'the wildest excitement!'"There is considerable truth in the above, we are sorry to state.Reporters are too apt to smooth over and give a fair face to thestupidity and bombast of political and other public humbugs.  Forthis they are not only seldom thanked, but frequently are kicked.Of course this sort of thing is wrong.  A Reporter should beindependent enough to meet the approaches of gentlemen of theNincompoop persuasion with a flat rebuff.  He should never glossover a political humbug, whether he belongs to "our side" or not.He is not thanked for doing it, and, furthermore, he loses therespect and confidence of his readers.  There are many amiablegentlemen ornamenting the various walks of life, who are under theimpression that for a dozen bad cigars or a few drinks of worsewhisky they can purchase the "opinion" of almost any Reporter.  Ithas been our pleasure on several occasions to disabuse thosegentlemen of this impression.Should another occasion of this kind ever offer, we feel that weshould be "adequate" to treat it in a similar manner.  A Reporter,we modestly submit, is as good as anybody, and ought to feel that heis, everywhere and at all times.  For one, let us quietly andwithout any show of vanity remark, that we are not only just as goodas anybody else, but a great deal better than many we know of.  Welove God and hate Indians:  pay our debts; support the Constitutionof the United States; go in for Progress, Sunshine, Calico, andother luxuries; are perfectly satisfied and happy, and wouldn't swop"sits" with the President, Louis Napoleon, the Emperor of China,Sultan of Turkey, Brigham Young, or Nicholas Longworth.  Success tous!1.54.  HE HAD THE LITTLE VOUCHER IN HIS POCKET.L-- lived in this city several years ago.  He dealt in horses,carriages, &c.  Hearing of a good chance to sell buggies up West, heembarked with a lot for that "great" country.  At Toledo he took aMichigan Southern train.  Somebody had by way of a joke, warned himagainst the conductor of that particular train, telling him thatsaid conductor had an eccentric way of taking up tickets at thebeginning of the journey, and of denying that he had done so anddemanding fare at the end thereof.  This the confiding L--swallowed.  He determined not to be swindled in this way, and sowhen the conductor came around and asked him for his ticket hedeclined giving up.  The conductor insisted.  L-- still refused."I've got the little voucher in my pocket," he said, with a knowinglook, slily slapping the pocket which contained the ticket.The conductor glanced at L--'s stalwart frame.  He had heard L--spoken of as a fighting man.  He preferred not to grapple with him.The train was a light one, and it so happened that L-- was the onlyman in this, the hind car.  So the conductor had the train stopped,and quietly unhitched this car."Good day, Mr. L," he yelled; "just keep that little voucher in yourpocket, and be d--d to you!"L-- jumped up and saw the other cars moving rapidly away.  He wasleft solitary and alone, in a dismal piece of woods known as theBlack Swamp.  He remained there in the car until night, when thedown-train came along and took him to Toledo.  He had to pay fare,his up through-ticket not being good on that train.  His buggies hadgone unattended to Chicago.  He was very angry.  He finally gotthrough, but he will never hear the last of that "little voucher."1.55.  THE GENTLEMANLY CONDUCTOR.Few have any idea of the trials and tribulations of the railwayconductor--"the gentlemanly conductor," as one-horse newspapersdelight in styling him.  Unless you are gifted with the patience ofthe lamented Job, who, tradition informs us, had "biles" all overhis body, and didn't swear once, never go for a Conductor, me boy!The other evening we enlivened a railroad car with our brilliantpresence. Starting time was not quite up, and the passengers wereamusing themselves by laughing, swearing, singing, and talking,according to their particular fancy.  The Conductor came in, and thefollowing were a few of the questions put to him:--One old fellow,who was wrapped up in a horse-blanket, and who apparently had abouttwo pounds of pigtail in his mouth, wanted to know, "What pint ofcompass the keers was travelin in?"  An old lady, surrounded byband-boxes and enveloped in flannels, wanted to know what timethe eight o'clock train left Rock Island for "Dubu-kue?"  Acarroty-haired young man wanted to know if "free omyibuses" ranfrom the cars to the taverns in Toledo?  A tall, razor-facedindividual, evidently from the interior of Connecticut, desired toknow if "conductin" paid as well eout West as it did deoun in hiscountry; and a portly, close-shaven man with round keen eyes, andin whose face you could read the interest-table, asked the price ofcorner lots in Omaha.  These and many other equally absurd questionsthe conductor answered calmly and in a resigned manner.  And weshuddered as we thought how he would have to answer a similar stringof questions in each of the three cars ahead.1.56.  MORALITY AND GENIUS.We see it gravely stated in a popular Metropolitan journal that"true genius goes hand in hand, necessarily, with morality."  Thestatement is not a startlingly novel one.  It has been made,probably, about sixty thousand times before.  But it is untrue andfoolish.  We wish genius and morality were affectionate companions,but it is a fact that they are often bitter enemies.  They don'tnecessarily coalesce any more than oil and water do!  Innumerableinstances may be readily produced in support of this proposition.Nobody doubts that Sheridan had genius, yet he was a sad dog.  Mr.Byron, the author of Childe Harold "and other poems," was a man ofgenius, we think, yet Mr. Byron was a fearfully fast man.  Edgar A.Poe wrote magnificent poetry and majestic prose, but he was, inprivate life, hardly the man for small and select tea parties.We fancy Sir Richard Steele was a man of genius, but he gotdisreputably drunk, and didn't pay his debts.  Swift had genius--animmense lot of it--yet Swift was a cold-blooded, pitiless, bad man.The catalogue might be spun out to any length, but it were uselessto do it.  We don't mean to intimate that men of genius mustnecessarily be sots and spendthrifts--we merely speak of the factthat very many of them have been both, and in some instances muchworse than both.  Still we can't well see (though some think theycan) how the pleasure and instruction people derive from reading theproductions of these great lights is diminished because their moralswere "lavishly loose."  They might have written better had theirprivate lives been purer, but of this nobody can determine for thepretty good reason that nobody knows.So with actors.  We have seen people stay away from the theaterbecause Mrs. Grundy said the star of the evening invariably retiredto his couch in a state of extreme inebriety.  If the star isafflicted with a weakness of this kind, we may regret it.  We maypity or censure the star.  But we must still acknowledge the star'sgenius, and applaud it.  Hence we conclude that the chronic weaknessof actors no more affects the question of the propriety ofpatronizing theatrical representations, than the profligacy ofjourneymen shoemakers affects the question of the propriety ofwearing boots.  All of which is respectfully submitted.1.57.  ROUGH BEGINNING OF THE HONEYMOON.On last Friday morning an athletic young farmer in the town ofWaynesburg took a fair girl, "all bathed in blushes," from herparents, and started for the first town across the Pennsylvania lineto be married, where the ceremony could be performed without alicense.  The happy pair were accompanied by a sister of the girl, atall, gaunt, and sharp-featured female of some thirty-seven summers.The pair crossed the line, were married, and returned to Wellsvilleto pass the night.  People at the hotel where the wedding partystopped observed that they conducted themselves in a rather singularmanner.  The husband would take his sister-in-law, the tall femaleaforesaid, into one corner of the parlor and talk earnestly to hergesticulating wildly the while.  Then the tall female would "put herfoot down" and talk to him in an angry and excited manner.  Then thehusband would take his fair young bride into a corner, but he couldno sooner commence talking to her than the gaunt sister would rushin between them and angrily join in the conversation.  The people atthe hotel ascertained what all this meant about 9 o'clock thatevening.  There was an uproar in the room which had been assigned tothe newly married couple.  Female shrieks and masculine "swears"startled the people at the hotel, and they rushed to the spot.  Thegaunt female was pressing and kicking against the door of the room,and the newly-married man, mostly undressed, was barring her outwith all his might.  Occasionally she would kick the door far enoughopen to disclose the stalwart husband, in his Gentleman Greek Slaveapparel.  It appeared that the tall female insisted upon occupyingthe same room with the newly-wedded pair; that her sister wasfavorably disposed to the arrangement, and that the husband hadagreed to it before the wedding took place, and was now indignantlyrepudiating the contract.  "Won't you go away now, Susan, peaceful?"said the newly-married man, softening his voice."No," said she, "I won't--so there!""Don't you budge an inch!" cried the married sister within the room."Now--now, Maria," said the young man to his wife, in a piteoustone, "don't go for to cuttin' up in this way; now don't!""I'll cut up's much I wanter!" she sharply replied."Well," roared the desperate man, throwing the door wide open andstalking out among the crowd, "well, jest you two wimin put on yourduds and go right straight home and bring back the old man andwoman, and your grandfather, who is nigh on to a hundred; bring 'emall here, AND I'LL MARRY THE WHOLE D--D CABOODLE OF 'EM AND WE'LLALL SLEEP TOGETHER!"The difficulty was finally adjusted by the tall female taking a roomalone. Wellsville is enjoying itself over the "sensation."1.58.  A COLORED MAN OF THE NAME OF JEFFRIES.One beautiful day last August, Mr. Elmer of East Cleveland, sent hishired colored man, of the name of Jeffries, to town with a two-horsewagon to get a load of lime.  Mr. Elmer gave Jeffries 5 dollars withwhich to pay for the lime.  The horses were excellent ones, by theway, nicely matched, and more than commonly fast.  The colored manof the name of Jeffries came to town and drove to the Johnson StreetStation where he encountered a frail young woman of the name ofJenkins, who had just been released from jail, where she had beenconfined for naughtical conduct (drugging and robbing a sailor)."Will you fly with me, adorable Jenkins?" he unto her did say, "orwords to that effect," and unto him in reply she did up and say:"My African brother, I will.  Spirit," she continued, alluding to astone jug under the seat in the wagon, "I follow!"  Then into thetwo-horse wagon this fair maiden got and knavely telling the"perlice," to embark by the first packet for an unromantic landwhere the climate is intensely tropical, and where even Laplanders,who like fire, get more of a good thing than they want--doing andsaying thus the woman of the name of Jenkins mounted the seat withthe colored man of the sweet name of Jeffries; and so these twosweet, gushing children of nature rode gaily away.  Away towards thesetting sun.  Away towards Indiana--bright land of cheap whisky andcorn doin's!1.59.  NAMES.Any name which is suggestive of a joke, however poor the joke maybe, is often a nuisance.  We were once "confined" in a printing-office with a man named Snow.  Everybody who came in was bound tohave a joke about Snow.  If it was Summer the mad wags would say weought to be cold, for we had Snow there all the time--which was afact, though we sometimes wished Snow was where he would speedilymelt.  Not that we didn't like Snow.  Far from it.  His name waswhat disgusted us.  It was also once our misfortune to daily minglewith a man named Berry, we can't tell how many million times weheard him called Elderberry, Raspberry, Blueberry, Huckleberry,Gooseberry, &c.  The thing nearly made him deranged.  He joined thefilibusters and has made energetic efforts to get shot but had notsucceeded at last accounts, although we hear he has been "slewd"numerously.  There is a good deal in a name, our usually correctfriend W. Shakespeare to the contrary notwithstanding.Our own name is, unfortunately, one on which jokes, such as theyare, can be made, we cannot present a tabular statement of the timeswe have done things brown (in the opinion of partial friends) orhave been asked if we were related to the eccentric old slave andhorse "liberator," whose recent Virginia Reel has attracted so muchof the public attention.  Could we do so the array of figures wouldbe appalling.  And sometimes we think we will accept the first goodoffer of marriage that is made to us, for the purpose of changingour unhappy name, setting other interesting considerations entirelyaside.1.60.  HE FOUND HE WOULD.Several years ago Bill McCracken lived in Peru, Indiana.  (We werein Peru several years ago, and it was a nice place we DON'T think.)Mr. McCracken was a screamer, and had whipped all the recognizedfighting men on the Wabash.  One day somebody told him that JackLong, blacksmith of Logansport, said he would give him (McCracken) aprotracted fit of sickness if he would just come down there andsmell of his bones.  The McCracken at once laid in a stock ofprovisions, consisting of whisky in glass and chickens in the shell,and started for Logansport.  In a few days, he was brought home in abunged-up condition, on a cot-bed.  One eye was gouged out, aportion of his nose was chawed off, his left arm was in a sling, hishead was done up in an old rag, and he was pretty badly off himself.He was set down in the village bar-room, and turning to the crowdhe, in a feeble voice, said, hot tears bedewing his face the while,"Boys, you know Jack Long said if I'd come down to Loginsput he'dwhale h--ll out of me; and boys, you know I didn't believe it, butI've been down thar and I FOUND HE WOULD."He recovered after a lapse of years and led a better life.  As hesaid himself, he returned from Logansport a changed man.1.61.  "BURIAL IN RICHMOND AND RESURRECTION IN BOSTON."A drama with this title, written by a colored citizen (an artist byprofession), the characters being performed by colored citizens, wasplayed at the Melodeon last evening.  There were several whitepersons present, though most of the audience were colored.  Thegreat variety of colors made a gay, and indeed we may say gorgeousspectacle.A hasty sketch of this great moral production may not beuninteresting.  Act 1st, scene 1st, discloses a log-cabin, withfifteen minutes' intermission between each log.  "William, aspirited slave," and "John, the obedient slave," are in the cabin.William, the spirited slave, says he will be free, "Why," saysWilliam, "am I here thus?  Was this frame made to be in bondage?Shall THESE voices be hushed?  Never, never, never!"  "Oh, don't sayit thus," says John, the obedient slave, "for thus it should not be.An' I tole ye what it was, now, jes take keer of them pistiles orthey'll work yer ruins.  Mind what I say, Wilyim.  As for me I shallstay here with my dear Julia!"  (Immense applause).  "And so it hascome to this, ha?" said William, the spirited slave, standinghimself up and brandishing his arms in a terrific manner.  "And soit has come to this, ha?  And this is a free land, so it has come tothis--to this--TO THIS."  William appeared to be somewhat confusedat this point, but a wealthy newsboy in the audience helped him outby crying, "or any other man."  John and William then embraced,bitter tears moistening their manly breasts.  "Farwel, Wilyim," saidJohn, the obedient slave, "and bless you, bless you, me child."  Thespirited slave walks off and the obedient slave falls into a swoon.Tableau:  The Goddess of Liberty appears in a mackinaw blanket andpours incense on the obedient slave.  A member of the orchestra getsup and softly warbles on a bass drum.  Angels are heard singing inthe distance.  Curtain falls, the audience being soaking wet withtears.Act 2, scene first, discloses the house of Mr. Lyons, a slaveholderin Virginia.  Mr. Lyons, as we learn by the play, is "a member ofthe Whig Congress."  He learns that William, his spirited slave, hasescaped.  This makes him very angry, and he says he will break everybone in William's body.  He goes out and searches for William, butcannot find him, and comes back.  He takes a heavy drink, isstricken with remorse, and declares his intention to become a nun.John, the obedient slave, comes in and asks permission to marryJulia.  Mr. Lyons says, certainly, by all means, and preparationsare made for the wedding.The wedding takes place.  The scene that follows is ratherincomprehensible.  A young mariner has a clandestine interview withthe obedient slave, and receives 10 dollars to make a large box.  Anelderly mariner, not that mariner, but another mariner--rushes madlyin and fires a horse-pistol into the air.  He wheels and is aboutgoing off, when a black Octoroon rushes madly in and fires anotherhorse-pistol at the retreating mariner, who falls.  He says he isgoing to make a die of it.  Says he should have acted differently ifhe had only done otherwise, which was right, or else it wouldn't beso.  He forgets his part and don't say anything more, but he wrapshimself up in the American flag and expires like a son of agentleman.  More warblings on the bass drum.  The rest of theorchestra endeavor to accompany the drum, but are so deeply affectedthat they can't.  There is a death-like stillness in the house.  Allwas so still that had a cannon been fired off it could have beendistinctly seen.The next scene discloses a large square box.  Several coloredpersons are seen standing round the square box.  The mariner who waskilled in the last scene commences knocking off the cover of thebox.  He pulls the cover off, and up jumps the obedient slave andhis wife!  The obedient slave and his dear Julia fall out of thebox.  Great applause.  They rush to the footlights and kneel.  Quickmusic by the orchestra, in which the bass drum don't warble so muchas she did.  "I'm free!  I'M FREE!  I'M FREE!!" shrieks the obedientslave, "O I'm free!"  The stage is suddenly lighted up in a gorgeousmanner.  The obedient slave and his dear Julia continue kneeling.The dead mariner blesses them.  The Goddess of Liberty appearsagain--this time in a beaver overcoat--and pours some more incenseon the obedient slave.  An allegorical picture of Virtue appears ina red vest and military boots, on the left proscenium, John Brownthe barber appears as Lady Macbeth, and says there is a blue tingeinto his nails, and consequently he is an Octoroon.  Another actorwants to define his position on the Euclid Street improvement, butis hissed down.  Curtain descends amidst the admiring shouts of theaudience, red fire, music, and the violent assertion of the obedientslave that he is free.The play will not be repeated this evening, as was announced.  Thenotice will be given of its next performance.  It is the greatesteffort of the kind that we ever witnessed.1.62.  A MAYORALTY ELECTION.Messrs. Senter and Coffinberry, two esteemed citizens, are thecandidates.  Here's a faint attempt at a specimen scene.  Aninnocent German is discovered about half a mile from the polls ofthis or that ward.  A dozen ticket-peddlers scent him ("even as thewar-horse snuffs the battle," etc.), see him, and make a grand rushfor him.  They surround him, each shoves a bunch of tickets underhis nose, and all commence bellowing in his ears.  Here's the ticketyer want--Coffinberry.  Here's Senterberry and Coffinter.  What theh--l yer tryin' to fool the man for?  Don't yer spose he knows whohe wants ter vote for, say!  'Ere's the ticket--Sen--Coff--don'tcrowd--get off my toes, you d--d fool!  Workin' men's tickets is theticket you want!  To h--l wid yez workin' men's ticket, 'ere's theticket yez want!  No, by Cot, vote for Shorge B. Senter--he sayshe'll py all the peer for dems as votes for him as much more dan deycan trinks, by tam!  Senter be d--d!  Go for Coffinberry!Coffinberry was killed eight times in the Mexican war, and is infavor of justice and Pop'lar Sovrinty!  Oh gos! Senter was at thebattle of Tippe-ca-noo, scalped twelve Injuns and wrote a treatisein Horse-shoeing!  Don't go for Coffinberry.  He's down on all theDutch, and swears he'll have all their heads chopped off and runinto sausages if he's lected.  Do you know what George B. Sentersays about the Germans?  He says by -- they're in the habit ofstealing LIVE American infants and hashing 'em up into head cheese.By --!  That's a lie!  T'aint--I heard that say so with my ownmouth.  Let the man alone--stop yer pullin--I'll bust yer ear foryer yet.  My Cot, my Cot, what tam dimes dese 'lections is.  Wellyez crowd a poor Jarman till death, yer d--d spalpanes, yez?  Sen--Coff--Senterberry and Coffinter--Working Men's--Repub--Dem-whoop-h-l-whooray-bully-y-e-o-u-c-h!!The strongest side got the unfortunate German's vote and he wentsore and bleeding home and satisfied, no doubt, that this is a greatcountry, and that the American Eagle will continue to be a deeplyinteresting bird while his wings are in the hands of patriots likethe above.  Scenes like the above (only our description is veryimperfect) were played over and over again, at every ward in thecity, yesterday.  Let us be thankful that the country is safe--butwe should like to see some of the ward politicians gauged to-day,for we are confident the operation would exhibit an astonishingdepth of whiskey.Hurrah for the Bar--Stangled Spanner!1.63.  FISHING EXCURSION.The Leviathan, Capt. Wm. Sholl, left the foot of Superior Street at6 o'clock yesterday morning for a fishing excursion down the lake.There were about twenty persons in the party, and we think we neversaw a more lovely lot of men.  The noble craft swept majesticallyout of the Cuyahoga into the lake, and as she sped past a retiredcoal-dealer's office the Usher borrowed our pocket-handkerchief(which in the excess of his emotion he forgot to return to us) towipe away four large tears which trickled from his light bay eyes.On dashed the Leviathan at the rate of about forty-five knots anhour.  The fishing-ground reached, the clarion voice of Sholl washeard to ejaculate, "Reef home the jib-boom, shorten the main-brace,splice the forecastle, and throw the hurricane-deck overboard!Lively, my lads!"  "Aye, aye, Sir!" said Marsh the chaplain of theexpedition, in tones of thunder, and the gallant party sprang toexecute the Captain's orders, the agile form of first-officerHilliard being especially conspicuous in reefing the jib-boom.Lines were cast and the sport commenced.  It seemed as if all thefish in the lake knew of our coming, and had collected in thatparticular spot for the express purpose of being caught!  What teeththey had--sufficiently good, certainly, to bite a cartridge oranything else.  The Usher caught the first fish--a small butbeautiful bass, whose weight was about three inches and a half.  TheUsher was elated at this streak of luck, but his hand did nottremble and he continued to hand in fish until at noon he had caughtthirteen firkins full and he announced that he should fish no more.Cruelty was no part of his nature and he did not think it right toslaughter fish in this way.  Cross, Barney, and the rest, wereimmensely successful, and hauled in tremendous quantities of bass,perch, Mackinaw trout, and Connecticut shad.  Bone didn't catch afish, and we shall never forget the sorrowful manner in which thepoor fellow gazed upon our huge pile of beautiful bass whichoccupied all of the quarter deck and a large portion of theforcastle.  Having fished enough the party went ashore, where theyfound Ab. McIlrath (who was fanning himself with a barn door), thegrand Commandant (who in a sonorous voice requested the parties, asthey alighted from the small boats, to "Keep their heads out ofwater"), the General (who was discussing with the Doctor thepropriety of annexing East Cleveland to the United States), andseveral distinguished gentlemen from town, who had come down withlife-preservers and ginger pop.  After disposing of a sumptuouslunch, the party amused and instructed each other by conversation,and about 3 o'clock the shrill whistle of the Leviathan was soundedby Mike the urbane and accomplished engineer, and the party weresoon homeward bound.  It was a good time.This etext was produced by J.C. Byers at jcbyers@capitalnet.com.Proofreaders were: J.C.

Now Al-Fazl was the most generous of the people ofhis age, upright of life, so that all hearts united in loving himand the wise flocked to him for counsel; whilst the subjects usedto pray for his long life, because he was a compendium of thebest qualities, encouraging the good and lief, and preventingevil and mischief.  But the Wazir Mu'in bin Sawi on the contraryhated folk [FN#4] and loved not the good and was a mere compoundof ill; even as was said of him,"Hold to nobles, sons of nobles! 'tis ever Nature's test  * That     nobles born of nobles shall excel in noble deed:And shun the mean of soul, meanly bred, for 'tis the law, *  Mean     deeds come of men who are mean of blood and breed."And as much as the people loved and fondly loved Al-Fazl binKhakan, so they hated and thoroughly hated the mean and miserlyMu'in bin Sawi. It befel one day by the decree of the Decreer,that King Mohammed bin Sulayman al-Zayni, being seated on histhrone with his officers of state about him, summoned his WazirAl-Fazl and said to him, "I wish to have a slave-girl of passingbeauty, perfect in loveliness, exquisite in symmetry and endowedwith all praiseworthy gifts."  Said the courtiers, "Such a girlis not to be bought for less than ten thousand gold pieces:"whereupon the Sultan called out to his treasurer and said, "Carryten thousand dinars to the house of Al-Fazl bin Khakan." Thetreasurer did the King's bidding; and the Minister went away,after receiving the royal charge to repair to the slave-bazarevery day, and entrust to brokers the matter aforesaid.  Moreoverthe King issued orders that girls worth above a thousand goldpieces should not be bought or sold without being first displayedto the Wazir.  Accordingly no broker purchased a slave-girl ereshe had been paraded before the minister; but none pleased him,till one day a dealer came to the house and found him takinghorse and intending for the palace.  So he caught hold of hisstirrup saying,"O thou, who givest to royal state sweet savour, * Thou'rt a     Wazir shalt never fail of favour!Dead Bounty thou hast raised to life for men;  * Ne'er fail of     Allah's grace such high endeavour!"Then quoth he, "O my lord, that surpassing object for whom thegracious mandate was issued is at last found; [FN#5]" and quoththe Wazir, "Here with her to me!"  So he went away and returnedafter a little, bringing a damsel in richest raiment robed, amaid spear-straight of stature and five feet tall; budding ofbosom with eyes large and black as by Kohl traced, and dewy lipssweeter than syrup or the sherbet one sips, a virginette smoothcheeked and shapely faced, whose slender waist with massive hipswas engraced; a form more pleasing than branchlet waving upon thetop-most trees, and a voice softer and gentler than the morningbreeze, even as saith one of those who have described her,"Strange is the charm which dights her brows like Luna's disk     that shine; * O sweeter taste than sweetest Robb[FN#6] or     raisins of the vine.A throne th'Empyrean keeps for her in high and glorious state, *     For wit and wisdom, wandlike form and graceful bending line:She in the Heaven of her face[FN#7] the seven-fold stars     displays, * That guard her cheeks as satellites against     the spy's design:If man should cast a furtive glance or steal far look at her, *     His heart is burnt by devil-bolts shot by those piercing     eyne."When the Wazir saw her she made him marvel with excess ofadmiration, so he turned, perfectly pleased, to the broker andasked, "What is the price of this girl?"; whereto he answered,"Her market-value stands at ten thousand dinars, but her ownerswears that this sum will not cover the cost of the chickens shehath eaten, the wine she hath drunken and the dresses of honourbestowed upon her instructor: for she hath learned calligraphyand syntax and etymology; the commentaries of the Koran; theprinciples of law and religion; the canons of medicine, and thecalendar and the art of playing on musical instruments."[FN#8]Said the Wazir, "Bring me her master."  So the broker brought himat once and, behold, he was a Persian of whom there was left onlywhat the days had left; for he was as a vulture bald and scaldand a wall trembling to its fall.  Time had buffetted him withsore smart, yet was he not willing this world to depart; even assaid the poet,"Time hath shattered all my frame, *  Oh! how time hath     shattered me.Time with lordly might can tame    * Manly strength and vigour     free.Time was in my youth, that none    * Sped their way more fleet         and fast:Time is and my strength is gone,   * Youth is sped, and speed     is past.[FN#9]"The Wazir asked him, "Art thou content to sell this slave-girl tothe Sultan for ten thousand dinars?"; and the Persian answered,"By Allah, if I offer her to the King for naught, it were but mydevoir."[FN#10] So the Minister bade bring the monies and sawthem weighed out to the Persian, who stood up before him andsaid, "By the leave of our lord the Wazir, I have somewhat tosay;" and the Wazir replied, "Out with all thou hast!"  "It is myopinion," continued the slave-dealer, "that thou shouldst notcarry the maid to the King this day; for she is newly off ajourney; the change of air[FN#11] hath affected her and the toilsof trouble have fretted her.  But keep her quiet in thy palacesome ten days, that she may recover her looks and become again asshe was.  Then send her to the Hammam and clothe her in therichest of clothes and go up with her to the Sultan: this will bemore to thy profit."  The Wazir pondered the Persian's words andapproved of their wisdom; so he carried her to his palace, wherehe appointed her private rooms, and allowed her every daywhatever she wanted of meat and drink and so forth.  And on thiswise she abode a while.  Now the Wazir Al-Fazl had a son like thefull moon when sheeniest dight, with face radiant in light,cheeks ruddy bright, and a mole like a dot of ambergris on adowny site; as said of him the poet and said full right,"A moon which blights you[FN#12] if you dare behold; * A branch     which folds you in its waving fold:Locks of the Zanj[FN#13] and golden glint of hair; * Sweet gait     and form a spear to have and hold:Ah! hard of heart with softest slenderest waist, * That evil to     this weal why not remould?[FN#14]Were thy form's softness placed in thy heart, * Ne'er would thy     lover find thee harsh and cold:Oh thou accuser! be my love's excuser, * Nor chide if love-pangs     deal me woes untold!I bear no blame: 'tis all my hear and eyne; * So leave thy     blaming, let me yearn and pine."Now the handsome youth knew not the affair of the damsel; and hisfather had enjoined her closely, saying, "Know, O my daughter,that I have bought thee as a bedfellow for our King, Mohammed binSulayman al-Zayni; and I have a son who is a Satan for girls andleaves no maid in the neighbourhood without taking hermaidenhead; so be on thy guard against him and beware of lettinghim see thy face or hear they voice." "Hearkening and obedience,"said the girl; and he left her and fared forth.  Some days afterthis it happened by decree of Destiny, that the damsel repairedto the baths in the house, where some of the slave women bathedher; after which she arrayed herself in sumptuous raiment; andher beauty and loveliness were thereby redoubled.  Then she wentin to the Wazir's wife and kissed her hand; and the dame said toher, "Naiman!  May it benefit thee,[FN#15] O Anis al-Jalis![FN#16]  Are not our baths handsome?"  "O my mistress," shereplied, "I lacked naught there save thy gracious presence." Thereupon the lady said to her slave-women, "Come with us to theHammam, for it is some days since we went there:" they answered,"To hear is to obey!" and rose and all accompanied her. Now shehad set two little slave-girls to keep the door of the privatechamber wherein was Anis al-Jalis and had said to them, "Suffernone go in to the damsel."  Presently, as the beautiful maidensat resting in her rooms, suddenly came in the Wazir's son whosename was Nur al-Din Ali,[FN#17] and asked after his mother andher women, to which the two little slave-girls replied, "They arein the Hammam."  But the damsel, Anis al-Jalis, had heard fromwithin Nur al-Din Ali's voice and had said to herself, "O wouldHeaven I saw what like is this youth against whom the Wazirwarned me, saying that he hath not left a virgin in theneighbourhood without taking her virginity: by Allah, I do longto have sight of him!"  So she sprang to her feet with thefreshness of the bath on her and, stepping to the door, looked atNur al-Din Ali and saw a youth like the moon in its full and thesight bequeathed her a thousand sighs. The young man also glancedat her and the look make him heir to a thousand thoughts of care;and each fell into Love's ready snare.  Then he stepped up to thetwo little slave-girls and cried aloud at them; whereupon bothfled before him and stood afar off to see what he would do.  Andbehold, he walked to the door of the damsel's chamber and,opening it, went in and asked her "Art thou she my father boughtfor me?" and she answered "Yes." Thereupon the youth, who waswarm with wine, came up to her and embraced her; then he took herlegs and passed them round his waist and she wound her arms abouthis neck, and met him with kisses and murmurs of pleasure andamorous toyings.  Next he sucked her tongue and she sucked his,and lastly, he loosed the strings of her petticoat-trousers andabated her maidenhead.  When the two little slave-girls saw theiryoung master get in unto the damsel, Anis al-Jalis, they criedout and shrieked; so as soon as the youth had had his wicked willof her, he rose and fled forth fearing the consequences of hisill-doing.  When the Wazir's wife heard the slave-girls' cries,she sprang up and came out of the baths with the perspirationpouring from her face, saying, "What is this unseemly clamour inthe house[FN#18]?"  Then she came up to the two little slave-girls and asked them saying, "Fie upon you! what is the matter?";and both answered, "Verily our lord Nur al-Din came in and beatus, so we fled; then he went up to Anis al-Jalis and threw hisarms round her and we know not what he did after that; but whenwe cried out to thee he ran away."  Upon this the lady went toAnis al-Jalis and said to her, "What tidings?"  "O my lady," sheanswered, "as I was sitting here lo! a handsome young man came inand said to me:--Art thou she my father bought for me?; and Ianswered Yes; for, by Allah, O mistress mine, I believed that hiswords were true; and he instantly came in and embraced me."  "Didhe nought else with thee but this?" quoth the lady, and quothshe, "Indeed he did!  But he did it only three times." "He didnot leave thee without dishonouring thee!" cried the Wazir's wifeand fell to weeping and buffetting her face, she and the girl andall the handmaidens, fearing lest Nur al-Din's father should killhim.[FN#19]  Whilst they were thus, in came the Wazir and askedwhat was the matter, and his wife said to him, "Swear that whatsoI tell thee thou wilt attend to it."  "I will," answered he.  Soshe related to him what his son had done, whereat he was muchconcerned and rent his raiment and smote his face till his nosebled, and plucked out his beard by the handful. "Do not killthyself," said his wife, "I will give thee ten thousand dinars,her price, of my own money."  But he raised his head and cried,"Out upon thee!  I have no need of her purchase-money: my fear islest life as well as money go."  "O my lord, and how is that?" "Wottest thou not that yonder standeth our enemy Al Mu'in binSawi who, as soon as he shall hear of this matter, will go up tothe Sultan"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceasedsaying her permitted say.              When it was the Thirty-fifth Night,She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that theWazir said to his wife, "Wottest thou not that yonder standethour enemy Al-Mu'in bin Sawi who, as soon as he hears of thismatter will go up to the Sultan and say to him, 'Thy Wazir who,thou wilt have it loveth thee, took from thee ten thousand ducatsand bought therewith a slave-girl whose like none ever beheld;but when he saw her, she pleased him and he said to his son,'Take her: thou art worthier of her than the Sultan.'  So he tookher and did away with her virginity and she is now in his house.' The King will say, 'Thou liest!' to which he will reply, 'Withthy leave I will fall upon him unawares and bring her to thee.' The King will give him warranty for this and he will come downupon the house and will take the girl and present her to theSultan, who will question her and she will not be able to denythe past.  Then mine enemy will say, 'O my lord, thou wottestthat I give thee the best of counsel; but I have not found favourin thine eyes.'  Thereupon the Sultan will make an example of me,and I shall be a gazing-stock to all the people and my life willbe lost."  Quoth his wife, "Let none know of this thing whichhath happened privily, and commit thy case to Allah and trust inHim to save thee from such strait; for He who knoweth the futureshall provide for the future."  With this she brought the Wazir acup of wine and his heart was quieted, and he ceased to feelwrath and fear.  Thus far concerning him; but as regards his sonNur al-Din Ali, fearing the consequence of his misdeed he abodehis day long in the flower garden and came back only at night tohis mother's apartment where he slept; and, rising before dawn,returned to the gardens.  He ceased not to do thus for two wholemonths without showing his face to his parent, till at last hismother said to his father, "O my lord, shall we lose our boy aswell as the girl?  If matters continue long in this way he willflee from us."  "And what to do?" asked he; and she answered, "Dothou watch this night; and, when he cometh, seize on him andfrighten him: I will rescue him from thee and do thou make peacewith him and give him the damsel to wife, for she loveth him ashe loveth her.  And I will pay thee her price." So the Ministersay up that night and, when his son came, he seized him andthrowing him down knelt on his breast and showed as thou he wouldcut his throat; but his mother ran to the youth's succour andasked her husband, "What wouldest thou do with him?"  He answeredher, "I will split his weasand."  Said the son to the father, "Ismy death, then, so light a matter to thee?"; and his father'seyes welled with tears, for natural affection moved him, and herejoined, "O my son, how light was to thee the loss of my goodand my life!"  Quoth Nur al-Din, "Hear, O my father, what thepoet hath said,'Forgive me! thee-ward sinned I, but the wise * Ne'er to the     sinner shall deny his grace:Thy foe may pardon sue when lieth he * In lowest, and thou     holdest highest place!'"Thereupon the Wazir rose from off his son's breast saying, "Iforgive thee!"; for his heart yearned to him; and the youthkissed the hand of his sire who said, "O my son, were I sure thatthou wouldest deal justly by Anis al-Jalis, I would give her tothee."  "O my father, what justice am I to do to her?"  "I enjointhee, O my son, not to take another wife or concubine to sharewith her, nor sell her."  "O my father! I swear to thee thatverily I will not do her injustice in either way."  Having swornto that effect Nur al-Din went in to the damsel and abode withher a whole year, whilst Allah Almighty caused the King to forgetthe matter of the maiden; and Al-Mu'in, though the affair came tohis ears, dared not divulge it by reason of the high favour inwhich his rival stood with the Sultan.  At the end of the yearAl-Fazl went one day to the public baths; and, as he came outwhilst he was still sweating, the air struck him[FN#20] and hecaught a cold which turned to a fever; then he took to his bed. His malady gained ground and restlessness was longsome upon himand weakness bound him like a chain; so he called out, "Hitherwith my son;" and when Nur al-Din Ali came he said to him, "O myson, know that man's lot and means are distributed and decreed;and the end of days by all must be dree'd; and that every souldrain the cup of death is nature's need."  The he repeated theselines,"I die my death, but He alone is great who dieth not! * And well     I wot, soon shall I die, for death was made my lot:A King there's not that dies and holds his kingdom in his hand, *     For Sovranty the Kingdom is of Him who dieth not."Then he continued, "O my son, I have no charge to leave thee savethat thou fear Allah and look to the issues of thine acts andbear in mind my injunctions anent Anis al-Jalis."  "O my father!"said Nur al-Din, "who is like unto thee?  Indeed thou art famedfor well doing and preachers offer prayers for thee in theirpulpits!"  Quoth Al-Fazl, "O my son, I hope that Allah Almightymay grant me acceptance!"  Then he pronounced the TwoTestimonies,[FN#21] or Professions of the Faith, and was recordedamong the blessed.  The palace was filled with crying andlamentation and the news of his death reached the King, and thecity-people wept, even those at their prayers and women athousehold cares and the school-children shed tears for Bin-Khakan.  Then his son Nur al-Din Ali arose and made ready hisfuneral, and the Emirs and Wazirs and high Officers of State andcity-notables were present, amongst them the Wazir al-Mu'in binSawi.  And as the bier went forth from the house some one in thecrowd of mourners began to chant these lines,"On the fifth day I quitted al my friends for evermore, * And     they laid me out and washed me on a slab without my     door:[FN#22]They stripped me of the clothes I was ever wont to wear, * And     they clothed me in the clothes which till then I never wore.On four men's necks they bore me and carried me from home * To     chapel; and some prayed for him on neck they bore:They prayed for me a prayer that no prostration knows;[FN#23] *     They prayed for me who praised me and were my friends of     yore;And they laid me in a house with a ceiling vaulted o'er, * And     Time shall be no more ere it ope to me its door."When they had shovelled in the dust over him and the crowd haddispersed, Nur al-Din returned home and he lamented with sobs andtears; and the tongue of the case repeated these couplets,"On the fifth day at even-tide they went away from me: *      farewelled them as faring they made farewell my lot:But my spirit as they went, with them went and so I cried, * 'Ah     return ye!' but replied she, 'Alas! return is notTo a framework lere and lorn that lacketh blood and life, * A     frame whereof remaineth naught but bones that rattle and     rot:Mine eyes are blind and cannot see quencht by the flowing tear! *     Mine ears are dull and lost to sense: they have no power to     hear!'"He abode a long time sorrowing for his father till, one day, ashe was sitting at home, there came a knocking at the door; so herose in haste and opening let in a man, one of his father'sintimates and who had been the Wazir's boon-companion.  Thevisitor kissed Nur al-Din's hand and said to him, "O my lord, hewho hath left the like of thee is not dead; and this way wentalso the Chief of the Ancients and the Moderns. [FN#24] O my lordAli, be comforted and leave sorrowing."  Thereupon Nur al-Dinrose and going to the guest-saloon transported thither all heneeded. Then he assembled his companions and took his handmaidagain; and, collecting round him ten of the sons of themerchants, began to eat meat and drink wine, giving entertainmentafter entertainment and lavishing his presents and his favours. One day his Steward came to him and said, "O my lord Nur al-Din,hast thou not heard the saying, Whoso spendeth and reckoneth not,to poverty wendeth and recketh not?"  And he repeated what thepoet wrote,"I look to my money and keep it with care, * For right well I wot     'tis my buckler and brand:Did I lavish my dirhams on hostilest foes,[FN#25] * I should     truck my good luck by mine ill luck trepanned:So I'll eat it and drink it and joy in my wealth; * And no     spending my pennies on others I'll stand:I will keep my purse close 'gainst whoever he be; * And a niggard     in grain a true friend ne'er I fand:Far better deny him than come to say:--Lend, * And five-fold the     loan shall return to thy hand!And he turns face aside and he sidles away, * While I stand like     a dog disappointed, unmanned,Oh, the sorry lot his who hath yellow-boys none, * Though his     genius and virtues shine bright as the sun!O my master," continued the Steward, "this lavish outlay andthese magnificent gifts waste away wealth."  When Nur al-Din Aliheard these words he looked at his servant and cried, "Of allthou hast spoken I will not heed one single word, for I haveheard the saying of the poet who saith,'An my palm be full of wealth and my wealth I ne'er bestow, * A     palsy take my hand and my foot ne'er rise again!Show my niggard who by niggardise e'er rose to high degree, * Or     the generous gifts generally hath slain.'"And he pursued, "Know, O Steward, it is my desire that so long asthou hast money enough for my breakfast, thou trouble me not withtaking thought about my supper."  Thereupon the Steward asked,"Must it be so?"; and he answered, "It must."  So the honest manwent his way and Nur al-Din Ali devoted himself to extravagance;and, if any of his cup-companions chanced to say, "This is apretty thing;" he would reply, "'Tis a gift to thee!"; or ifanother said, "O my lord, such a house is handsome;" he wouldanswer, "Take it: it is thine!"  After this reckless fashion hecontinued to live for a whole year, giving his friends a banquetin the morning and a banquet in the evening and a banquet atmidnight, till one day, as the company was sitting together, thedamsel Anis al-Jalis repeated these lines,"Thou deemedst well of Time when days went well, * And feardest     not what ills might deal thee Fate:Thy nights so fair and restful cozened thee, *  For peaceful     nights bring woes of heavy weight."When she had ended her verse behold, somebody knocked at thedoor. So Nur al-Din rose to open it and one of his boon-companions followed him without being perceived.  At the door hefound his Steward and asked him, "What is the matter?"; and heanswered, "O my lord, what I dreaded for thee hath come to pass!" "How so?"  "Know that there remains not a dirham's worth, less ormore in my hands.  Here are my Daftars and account books showingboth income and outlay and the registers of thine originalproperty."  When Nur al-Din heard these words he bowed his headand said, "There is no Majesty and there is no Might save inAllah!"  When the man who had followed him privily to spy on himheard the Steward's words, he returned to his friends and warnedthem saying, "Look ye well to what ye do: Nur al-Din ispenniless;" and, as the young host came back to his guests,vexation showed itself in his face.  Thereupon one of theintimates rose; and, looking at the entertainer, said to him, "Omy lord, may be thou wilt give me leave to retire?"  "And why soearly retirement this day?"; asked he and the other answered him,"My wife is in childbirth and I may not be absent from her:indeed I must return and see how she does."  So he gave himleave, whereupon another rose and said, "O my lord Nur al-Din, Iwish now to go to my brother's for he circumciseth his son to-day."[FN#26]  In short each and every asked permission to retireon some pretence or other, till all the ten were gone leaving Nural-Din alone.  Then he called his slave-girl and said to her, "OAnis al-Jalis, hast thou seen what case is mine?"  And he relatedto her what the Steward had told him.  Then quoth she, "O mylord, for many nights I had it in my mind to speak with thee ofthis matter, but I heard thee repeating,'When the World heaps favours on thee, pass on * Thy favours to     friends ere her hand she stay:Largesse never let her when fain she comes, * Nor niggardise kept     her from turning away!'When I heard these verses I held my peace and cared not toexchange a word with thee."  "O Anis al-Jalis," said Nur al-Din,"thou knowest that I have not wasted my wealth save on myfriends, especially these ten who have now left me a pauper, andI think they will not abandon and desert me without relief."  "ByAllah," replied she, "they will not profit thee with aught ofaid."  Said he, "I will rise at once and go to them and knock attheir doors; it may be I shall get from them somewhat wherewith Imay trade and leave pastime and pleasuring."  So he rose withoutstay or delay, and repaired to a street wherein all his tenfriends lived.  He went up to the nearest door and knocked;whereupon a handmaid came out and asked him, "Who art thou?"; andhe answered, "Tell thy master that Nur al-Din Ali standeth at thedoor and saith to him, 'Thy slave kisseth thy hand and awaiteththy bounty.'"  The girl went in and told her master, who cried ather, "Go back and say, 'My master is not at home.'"  So shereturned to Nur al-Din, and said to him, "O my lord, my master isout."  Thereupon he turned away and said to himself, "If this onebe a whoreson knave and deny himself, another may not provehimself such knave and whoreson."  Then he went up to the nextdoor and sent in a like message to the house-master, who deniedhimself as the first had done, whereupon he began repeating,"He is gone who when to his gate thou go'st, * Fed thy famisht     maw with his boiled and roast."When he had ended his verse he said, "By Allah, there is no helpbut that I make trial of them all: perchance there be one amongstthem who will stand me in the stead of all the rest."  So he wentthe round of the ten, but not one of them would open his door tohim or show himself or even break a bit of bread before him;whereupon he recited,"Like a tree is he who in wealth doth wone, * And while fruits he     the folk to his fruit shall run:But when bared the tree of what fruit it bare, * They leave it to     suffer from dust and sun.Perdition to all of this age!  I find * Ten rogues for every     righteous one."Then he returned to his slave-girl and his grief had grown moregrievous and she said to him, "O my lord, did I not tell thee,none would profit thee with aught of aid?"  And he replied, "ByAllah, not one of them would show me his face or know me!"  "O mylord," quoth she, "sell some of the moveables and householdstuff, such as pots and pans, little by little; and expend theproceeds until Allah Almighty shall provide."  So he sold all ofthat was in the house till nothing remained when he turned toAnis al-Jalis and asked her "What shall we do now?"; and sheanswered, "O my lord, it is my advice that thou rise forthwithand take me down to the bazar and sell me.  Thou knowest thatthey father bought me for ten thousand dinars: haply Allah mayopen thee a way to get the same price, and if it be His will tobring us once more together, we shall meet again."  "O Anis al-Jalis," cried he, "by Allah it is no light matter for me to beparted from thee for a single hour!"  "By Allah, O my lord," shereplied, "nor is it easy to me either, but Need hath its own law,as the poet said,'Need drives a man into devious roads, * And pathways doubtful of     trend and scope:No man to a rope[FN#27] will entrust his weight, * Save for cause     that calleth for case of rope.'"Thereupon he rose to his feet and took her,[FN#28] whilst thetears rolled down his cheek like rain; and he recited with thetongue of the case these lines,"Stay! grant one parting look before we part, * Nerving my heart     this severance to sustain:But, an this parting deal thee pain and bane, * Leave me to die     of love and spare thee pain!"Then he went down with her to the bazar and delivered her to thebroker and said to him, "O Hajj Hasan,[FN#29] I pray thee notethe value of her thou hast to cry for sale."  "O my lord Nur al-Din," quoth the broker, "the fundamentals are remembered;"[FN#30]adding, "Is not this the Anis al-Jalis whom thy father bought ofme for ten thousand dinars?" "Yes," said Nur al-Din.  Thereuponthe broker went round to the merchants, but found that all hadnot yet assembled.  So he waited till the rest had arrived andthe market was crowded with slave-girls of all nations, Turks,Franks and Circassians; Abyssinians, Nubians and Takruris;[FN#31]Tartars, Georgians and others; when he came forward and standingcried aloud, "O merchants! O men of money! every round thing isnot a walnut and every long thing a banana is not; all reds arenot meat nor all whites fat, nor is every brown thing adate![FN#32]  O merchants, I have here this union-pearl that hathno price: at what sum shall I cry her?" "Cry her at four thousandfive hundred dinars," quoth one of the traders. The broker openedthe door of sale at the sum named and, as he was yet calling, lo!the Wazir Al-Mu'in bin Sawi passed through the bazar and, seeingNur al-Din Ali waiting at one side, said to himself, "Why isKhakan's son[FN#33] standing about here?  Hath this gallows-birdaught remaining wherewith to buy slave-girls?"  Then he lookedround and, seeing the broker calling out in the market with allthe merchants around him, said to himself, "I am sure that he ispenniless and hath brought hither the damsel Anis al-Jalis forsale;" adding, "O how cooling and grateful is this to my heart!" Then he called the crier, who came up and kissed the groundbefore him; and he said to him, "I want this slave-girl whom thouart calling for sale."  The broker dared not cross him, so heanswered, "O my lord, Bismillah! in Allah's name so be it;" andled forward the damsel and showed her to him.  She pleased himmuch whereat he asked, "O Hasan, what is bidden for this girl?"and he answered, "Four thousand five hundred dinars to open thedoor of sale." Quoth Al-Mu'in, "Four thousand five hundred is MYbid."  When the merchants heard this, they held back and darednot bid another dirham, wotting what they did of the Wazir'styranny, violence and treachery. So Al-Mu'in looked at the brokerand said to him, "Why stand still? Go and offer four thousanddinars for me and the five hundred shall be for thyself." Thereupon the broker went to Nur al-Din and said, "O my lord, thyslave is going for nothing!"  "And how so?" asked he. The brokeranswered, "We had opened the biddings for her at four thousandfive hundred dinars; when that tyrant, Al-Mu'in bin Sawi, passedthrough the bazar and, as he saw the damsel she pleased him, sohe cried to me, 'Call me the buyer at four thousand dinars andthou shalt have five hundred for thyself.'  I doubt not but thathe knoweth that the damsel if thine, and if he would pay theedown her price at once it were well; but I know his injustice andviolence; he will give thee a written order upon some of hisagents and will send after thee to say to them, 'Pay himnothing.'  So as often as though shalt go in quest of the cointhey will say, 'We'll pay thee presently!' and they will put theeoff day after day, and thou art proud of spirit; till at last,when they are wearied with thine importunity, they will say,'Show us the cheque.' Then, as soon as they have got hold of itthey will tear it up and so thou wilt lose the girl's price."When Nur al-Din heard this he looked at the broker and asked him,"How shall this matter be managed?"; and he answered, "I willgive thee a counsel which, if thou follow, it shall bring theecomplete satisfaction." "And what is that?" quoth Nur al-Din.Quoth the broker, "Come thou to me anon when I am standing in themiddle of the market and, taking the girl from my hand, give hera sound cuffing and say to her, 'Thou baggage, I have kept my vowand brought thee down to the slave-market, because I swore anoath that I would carry thee from home to the bazar, and makebrokers cry thee for sale.'  If thou do this, perhaps the devicewill impose upon the Wazir and the people, and they will believethat thou broughtest her not to the bazar, but for the quittanceof thine oath." He replied, "Such were the best way." Then thebroker left him and, returning into the midst of the market, tookthe damsel by the hand, and signed to the Wazir and said, "O mylord, here is her owner." With this up came Nur al-Din Ali and,snatching the girl from the broker's hand, cuffed her soundly andsaid to her, "Shame on thee, O thou baggage!  I have brought theeto the bazar for quittance of mine oath; now get thee home andthwart me no more as is thy wont.  Woe to thee! do I need thyprice, that I should sell thee? The furniture of my house wouldfetch thy value many times over!" When Al-Mu'in saw this he saidto Nur al-Din, "Out on thee!  Hast thou anything left for sellingor buying?"  And he would have laid violent hands upon him, butthe merchants interposed (for they all loved Nur al-Din), and theyoung man said to them, "Here am I in your hands and ye all knowhis tyranny."  "By Allah," cried the Wazir, "but for you I hadslain him!"  Then all signed with significant eyes to Nur al-Dinas much as to say, "Take thy wreak of him; not one of us willcome between thee and him."  Thereupon Nur al-Din, who was stoutof heart as he was stalwart of limb, went up to the Wazir and,dragging him over the pommel of his saddle, threw him to theground.  Now there was in that place a puddling- pit for brick-clay,[FN#34] into the midst of which he fell, and Nur al-Din keptpummelling and fisti-cuffing him, and one of the blows fell fullon his teeth, and his beard was dyed with his blood.  Also therewere with the minister ten armed slaves who, seeing their masterentreated after this fashion, laid hand on sword-hilt and wouldhave bared blades and fallen on Nur al-Din to cut him down; butthe merchants and bystanders said to them, "This is a Wazir andthat is the son of a Wazir; haply they will make friends sometime or other, in which case you will forfeit the favour of both. Or perchance a blow may befal your lord, and you will all die thevilest of deaths; so it were better for you not to interfere."Accordingly they held aloof and, when Nur al-Din had made an endof thrashing the Wazir, he took his handmaid and fared homewards.Al-Mu'in also went his ways at once, with his raiment dyed ofthree colours, black with mud, red with blood and ash colouredwith brick-clay. When he saw himself in this state, he bound abit of matting[FN#35] round his neck and, taking in hand twobundles of coarse Halfah-grass,[FN#36] went up to the palace andstanding under the Sultan's windows cried aloud, "O King of theage, I am a wronged man!  I am foully wronged!"  So they broughthim before the King who looked at him; and behold, it was thechief Minister; whereupon he said, "O Wazir who did this deed bythee?"  Al-Mu'in wept and sobbed and repeated these lines,"Shall the World oppress me when thou art in't? * In the lion's     presence shall wolves devour?Shall the dry all drink of thy tanks and I * Under rain-cloud     thirst for the cooling shower?""O my lord," cried he, "the like will befal every one who lovethand serveth thee well."  "Be quick with thee," quoth the Sultan,"and tell me how this came to pass and who did this deed by onewhose honour is part of my honour."  Quoth the Wazir, "Know, O mylord, that I went out this day to the slave-market to buy me acookmaid, when I saw there a damsel, never in my life long saw Ia fairer; and I designed to buy her for our lord the Sultan; so Iasked the broker of her and of her owner, and he answered, "Shebelongeth to Ali son of Al-Fazl bin Khakan.  Some time ago ourlord the Sultan gave his father ten thousand dinars wherewith tobuy him a handsome slave-girl, and he bought this maiden whopleased him; so he grudged her to our lord the Sultan and gaveher to his own son. When the father died, the son sold all he hadof houses and gardens and household gear, and squandered theprice till he was penniless.  Then he brought the girl to themarket that he might sell her, and he handed her over to thebroker to cry and the merchants bid higher and higher on her,until the price reached four thousand dinars; whereupon quoth Ito myself, 'I will buy this damsel for our lord the Sultan, whosemoney was paid for her.'  So I said to Nur al-Din, 'O my son,sell her to me for four thousand dinars.'  When he heard my wordshe looked at me and cried, 'O ill-omened oldster, I will sell herto a Jew or to a Nazarene, but I will not sell her to thee!'  'Ido not buy her for myself,' said I, 'I buy her for our lord andbenefactor the Sultan.'  Hearing my words he was filled withrage; and, dragging me off my horse (and I a very old man), beatme unmercifully with his fists and buffeted me with his palmstill he left me as thou seest, and all this hath befallen me onlybecause I thought to buy this damsel for thee!"  Then the Wazirthrew himself on the ground and lay there weeping and shivering. When the Sultan saw his condition and heard his story, the veinof rage started out between his eyes[FN#37] and he turned to hisbody-guard who stood before him, forty white slaves, smiters withthe sword, and said to them, "Go down forthright to the housebuilt by the son of Khakan and sack it and raze it and bring tome his son Nur al-Din with the damsel; and drag them both ontheir faces with their arms pinioned behind them."  They replied,"To hear is to obey;" and, arming themselves, they set out forthe house of Nur al-Din Ali.  Now about the Sultan was aChamerlain, Alam[FN#38] al-Din Sanjar hight, who had aforetimebeen Mameluke to Al-Fazl; but he had risen in the world and theSultan had advanced him to be one of his Chamberlains.  When heheard the King's command and saw the enemies make them ready toslay his old master's son, it was grievous to him: so he went outfrom before the Sultan and, mounting his beast, rode to Nur al-Din's house and knocked at the door.  Nur al-Din came out andknowing him would have saluted him: but he said, "O my masterthis is no time for greeting or treating.  Listen to what thepoet said,  'Fly, fly with thy life if by ill overtaken!   Let thy house speak thy death by its builder forsaken!   For a land else than this land thou may'st reach, my brother,   But thy life tho'lt ne'er find in this world another.'"[FN#39]"O Alam al-Din what cheer?" asked Nur al-Din, and he answered,"Rise quickly and fly for thy life, thou and the damsel; for Al-Mu'in hath set a snare for you both; and, if you fall into hishands, he will slay you.  The Sultan hath despatched fortysworders against you and I counsel you to flee ere harm can hurtyou."  Then Sanjar put his hand to his purse and finding thereforty gold pieces took them and gave them to Nur al-Din, saying,"O my lord receive these and journey with them.  Had I more Iwould give them to thee, but this is not the time to takeexception." Thereupon Nur al-Din went in to the damsel and toldher what had happened, at which she wrung her hands.  Then theyfared forth at once from the city, and Allah spread over them Hisveil of protection, so that they reached the river-bank wherethey found a vessel ready for sea.  Her skipper was standingamidships and crying, "Whoso hath aught to do, whether in the wayof provisioning or taking leave of his people; or whoso hathforgotten any needful thing, let him do it at once and return,for we are about to sail"; and all of them saying, "There isnaught left to be done by us, O captain!", he cried to his crew,"Hallo there! cast off the cable and pull up the mooring-pole!"[FN#40] Quoth Nur al-Din, "Whither bound, O captain?" andquoth he, "To the House of Peace, Baghdad," -And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the Thirty-sixth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theskipper answered, "To the House of Peace, Baghdad," Nur al-DinAli and the damsel went on board, and they launched the craft andshook out the sails, and the ship sped forth as though she were abird on wing; even as said one of them and said right well,"Watch some tall ship, she'll joy the sight of thee, * The breeze     outstripping in her haste to flee;As when a bird, with widely-spreading wings, * Leaveth the sky to     settle on the sea."So the vessel sailed on her fastest and the wind to her wasfairest. Thus far concerning them; but as regards the Mamelukes,they went to Nur al-Din's mansion and, breaking open the doors,entered and searched the whole place, but could find no trace ofhim and the damsel; so they demolished the house and, returningto the Sultan, reported their proceedings; whereupon quoth he,"Make search for them both, wherever they may be;" and theyanswered, "Hearing is obeying."  The Wazir Al-Mu'in had also gonehome after the Sultan had bestowed upon him a robe of honour, andhad set his heart at rest by saying, "None shall take blood-wreakfor thee save I;" and he had blessed the King and prayed for hislong life and prosperity.  Then the Sultan bade proclaim aboutthe city, "Oyez, O ye lieges one and all!  It is the will of ourlord the Sultan that whoso happeneth on Nur al-Din Ali son of Al-Fazl bin Khakan, and bringeth him to the Sultan, shall receive arobe of honour and one thousand gold pieces; and he who hidethhim or knoweth his abiding place and informeth not, deservethwhatsoever pains and penalties shall befal him."  So all began tosearch for Nur al-Din Ali, but they could find neither trace nortidings of him.  Meanwhile he and his handmaid sailed on with thewind right aft, till they arrived in safety at Baghdad, and thecaptain said to them, "This is Baghdad and 'tis the city wheresecurity is to be had: Winter with his frosts hath turned awayand Prime hath come his roses to display; and the flowers are a-glowing and the trees are blowing and the streams are flowing." So Nur al-Din landed, he and his handmaid and, giving the captainfive dinars, walked on a little way till the decrees of Destinybrought them among the gardens, and they came to a place sweptand sprinkled, with benches along the walls and hanging jarsfilled with water.[FN#41]  Overhead was a trellis of reed-workand canes shading the whole length of the avenue, and at theupper end was a garden gate, but this was locked.  "By Allah,"quoth Nur al-Din to the damsel, "right pleasant is this place!";and she replied, "O my lord sit with me a while on this bench andlet us take our ease."  So they mounted and sat them down on thebench, after which they washed their faces and hands; and thebreeze blew cool on them and they fell asleep and glory be to Himwho never sleepeth!  Not this garden was named the Garden ofGladness[FN#42] and therein stood a belvedere hight the Palace ofPleasure and the Pavilion of Pictures, the whole belonging to theCaliph Harun al-Rashid who was wont, when his breast wasstraitened with care, to frequent garden and palace and there tosit.  The palace had eighty latticed windows and fourscore lampshanging round a great candelabrum of gold furnished with wax-candles; and, when the Caliph used to enter, he would order thehandmaids to throw open the lattices and light up the rooms; andhe would bid Ishak bin Ibrahim the cup-companion and the slave-girls to sing till his breast was broadened and his ailments wereallayed.  Now the keeper of the garden, Shaykh Ibrahim, was avery old man, and he had found from time to time, when he wentout on any business, people pleasuring about the garden gate withtheir bona robas; at which he was angered with exceedinganger.[FN#43]  But he took patience till one day when the Caliphcame to his garden; and he complained of this to Harun al-Rashidwho said, "Whomsoever thou surprisest about the door of thegarden, deal with him as thou wilt."  Now on this day theGardener chanced to be abroad on some occasion and returningfound these two sleeping at the gate covered with a singlemantilla; whereupon said he, "By Allah, good!  These twain knownot that the Caliph hath given me leave to slay anyone I maycatch at the door; but I will give this couple a shrewd whipping,that none may come near the gate in future."  So he cut a greenpalm-frond[FN#44] and went up to them and, raising his arm tillthe white of his arm-pit appeared, was about to strike them, whenhe bethought himself and said, "O Ibrahim, wilt thou beat themunknowing their case?  Haply they are strangers or of the Sons ofthe Road,[FN#45] and the decrees of Destiny have thrown themhere.  I will uncover their faces and look at them."  So helifted up the mantilla from their heads and said, "They are ahandsome couple; it were not fitting that I should beat them." Then he covered their faces again and, going to Nur al-Din'sfeet, began to rub and shampoo them,[FN#46] whereupon the youthopened his eyes and, seeing an old man of grave and reverendaspect rubbing his feet, he was ashamed and drawing them in, satup.  Then he took Shaykh Ibrahim's hand and kissed it.  Quoth theold man, "O my son, whence art thou?"; and quoth he, "O my lord,we two are strangers," and the tears started from his eyes.  "Omy son," said Shaykh Ibrahim, "know that the Prophet (whom Allahbless and preserve!) hath enjoined honour to the stranger;" andadded, "Wilt not thou arise, O my son, and pass into the gardenand solace thyself by looking at it and gladden thy heart?"  "Omy lord," said Nur al-Din, "to whom doth this garden belong?;"and the other replied, "O my son, I have inherited it from myfolk."  Now his object in saying this was to set them at theirease and induce them to enter the garden.  So Nur al-Din thankedhim and rose, he and the damsel, and followed him into thegarden; and lo! it was a garden, and what a garden!  The gate wasarched like a great hall and over walls and roof ramped vineswith grapes of many colours; the red like rubies and the blacklike ebonies; and beyond it lay a bower of trelliced boughsgrowing fruits single and composite, and small birds on branchessang with melodious recite, and the thousand-noted nightingaleshrilled with her varied shright; the turtle with her cooingfilled the site; the blackbird whistled like human wight[FN#47]and the ring-dove moaned like a drinker in grievous plight.  Thetrees grew in perfection all edible growths and fruited allmanner fruits which in pairs were bipartite; with the camphor-apricot, the almond-apricot and the apricot "Khorasani" hight;the plum, like the face of beauty, smooth and bright; the cherrythat makes teeth shine clear by her sleight, and the fig of threecolours, green, purple and white.  There also blossomed theviolet as it were sulphur on fire by night; the orange with budslike pink coral and marguerite; the rose whose redness gars theloveliest cheeks blush with despight; and myrtle and gilliflowerand lavender with the blood-red anemone from Nu'uman hight.  Theleaves were all gemmed with tears the clouds had dight; thechamomile smiled showing teeth that bite, and Narcissus with hisnegro[FN#48] eyes fixed on Rose his sight; the citrons shone withfruits embowled and the lemons like balls of gold; earth wascarpeted with flowers tinctured infinite; for Spring was comebrightening the place with joy and delight; and the streams ranringing, to the birds' gay singing, while the rustling breezeupspringing attempered the air to temperance exquisite.  ShaykhIbrahim carried them up into the pavilion, and they gazed on itsbeauty, and on the lamps aforementioned in the latticed windows;and Nur al-Din, remembering his entertainments of time past,cried, "By Allah, this is a pleasant place; it hath quenched inme anguish which burned as a fire of Ghaza-wood.[FN#49]"  Thenthey sat down and Shaykh Ibrahim set food before them; and theyate till they were satisfied and washed their hands: after whichNur al-Din went up to one of the latticed windows, and, callingto his handmaid fell to gazing on the trees laden with all mannerfruits.  Presently he turned to the Gardener and said to him, "OShaykh Ibrahim hast thou no drink here, for folk are wont todrink after eating?"  The Shaykh brought him sweet water, cooland pleasant, but he said, "This is not the kind of drink Iwanted." "Perchance thou wishest for wine?"  "Indeed I do, OShaykh!"  "I seek refuge from it with Allah: it is thirteen yearssince I did this thing, for the Prophet (Abhak[FN#50]) cursed itsdrinker, presser, seller and carrier!"  "Hear two words of me." "Say on."  "If yon cursed ass[FN#51] which standeth there becursed, will aught of his curse alight upon thee?" "By no means!" "Then take this dinar and these two dirhams and mount yonder assand, halting afar from the wine-shop, call the first man thouseest buying liquor and say to him, 'Take these two dirhams forthyself, and with this dinar buy me some wine and set it on theass.' So shalt thou be neither the presser, nor the buyer, northe carrier; and no part of the curse will fall  upon thee."  Atthis Shaykh Ibrahim laughed and said, "By Allah, O my son, Inever saw one wilier of wit than thou art, nor heard aughtsweeter than thy speech."  So he did as he was bidden by Nur al-Din who thanked him and said, "We two are now dependent on thee,and it is only meet that thou comply with our wishes; so bring ushere what we require."  "O my son," replied he, "this is mybuttery before thee" (and it was the store-room provided for theCommander of the Faithful); "so go in, and take whatso thou wilt,for there is over and above what thou wantest."  Nur al-Din thenentered the pantry and found therein vessels of gold and silverand crystal set with all kinds of gems, and was amazed anddelighted with what he saw.  Then he took out what he needed andset it on and poured the wine into flagons and glass ewers,whilst Shaykh Ibrahim brought them fruit and flowers and aromaticherbs. Then the old man withdrew and sat down at a distance fromthem, whilst they drank and made merry, till the wine got thebetter of them, so that their cheeks reddened and their eyeswantoned like the gazelle's; and their locks became dishevelledand their brightness became yet more beautiful.  Then said ShaykhIbrahim to himself, "What aileth me to sit apart from them?  Whyshould I not sit with them?  When shall I ever find myself incompany with the like of these two that favour two moons?" So hestepped forward and sat down on the edge of the dais, and Nur al-Din said to him, "O my lord, my life on thee, come nearer to us!" He came and sat by them, when Nur al-Din filled a cup and lookedtowards the Shaykh and said to him, "Drink, that thou mayest trythe taste of it!" "I take refuge from it with Allah!" replied he;"for thirteen years I have not done a thing of the kind."  Nural-Din feigned to forget he was there and, drinking off the cup,threw himself on the ground as if the drink had overcome him;whereupon Anis al-Jalis glanced at him and said, "O ShaykhIbrahim see how this husband of mine treateth me;" and heanswered, "O my lady, what aileth him?"  "This is how he alwaysserveth me," cried she, "he drinketh awhile, then falleth asleepand leaveth me alone with none to bear me company over my cup norany to whom I may sing when the bowl goeth round."  Quoth theShaykh (and his mien unstiffened for that his soul inclinedtowards her), "By Allah, this is not well!" Then she crowned acup and looking towards him said, "By my life thou must take anddrink it, and not refuse to heal my sick heart!"  So he put forthhis hand and took it and drank it off and she filled a second andset it on the chandelier and said, "O master mine, there is stillthis one left for thee."  "By Allah, I cannot drink it;" criedhe, "what I have already drunk is enough for me;" but sherejoined, "By Allah, there is no help for it."  So he took thecup and drank; and she filled him a third which he took and wasabout to drink when behold, Nur al-Din rolled round and satupright,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceasedsaying her permitted say.             When it was the Thirty-seventh Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nur al-Dinsat upright and said, "Ho, Shaykh Ibrahim, what is this?  Did Inot adjure thee a while ago and thou refusedst, saying, 'What I!'tis thirteen years ago since I have done such a thing!'"  "ByAllah," quoth the Shaykh (and indeed he was abashed), "no sin ofmine this, she forced me to do it." Nur al-Din laughed and theysat down again to wine and wassail, but the damsel turned to hermaster and said in a whisper, "O my lord, drink and do not presshim, that I may show thee some sport with him."  Then she beganto fill her master's cup and he hers and so they did time aftertime, till at last Shaykh Ibrahim looked at them and said, "Whatfashion of good fellowship is this?  Allah curse the glutton whokeepeth the cup to himself!  Why dost thou not give me to drink,O my brother? What manners are these, O blessed one?"  At thisthe two laughed until they fell on their backs; then they drankand gave him to drink and ceased not their carousal till a thirdpart of the night was past.  Then said the damsel, "O ShaykhIbrahim, with thy leave I will get up and light one of thesecandles."  "Do so," he replied, "but light no more than one." Soshe sprang to her feet and, beginning with one candle, lightedall the eighty and sat down again.  Presently Nur al-Din said, "OShaykh Ibrahim, in what favour am I with thee?  May I not lightone of these lamps?" "Light one," replied he, "and bother me nomore in thy turn!"  So he rose and lighted one lamp afteranother, till he had lighted the whole eight and the palaceseemed to dance with brilliancy.  Quoth the Shaykh (and indeedintoxication had overcome him), "Ye two are bolder than I am."Then he rose to his feet and opened all the lattices and sat downagain; and they fell to carousing and reciting verses till theplace rang with their noisy mirth.  Now Allah, the Decreer whodecreeth all things and who for every effect appointeth a cause,had so disposed that the Caliph was at that moment sitting in thelight of the moon at one of the windows of his palace overlookingthe Tigris.  He saw the blaze of the lamps and wax candlesreflected in the river and, lifting his eyes, perceived that itcame from the Garden Palace which was all ablaze with brilliancy.So he cried, "Here to me with Ja'afar the Barmaki!"; and the lastword was hardly spoken ere the Wazir was present before theCommander of the Faithful, who cried at him, "O dog of aMinister, hast thou taken from me this city of Baghdad withoutsaying aught to me?"  "What words are these words?" askedJa'afar; and the Caliph answered, "If Baghdad city were not takenfrom me, the Palace of Pictures would not be illuminated withlamps and candles, nor would its windows be thrown open.  Woe tothee! who durst do a deed like this except the Caliphate had beentaken from me?" Quoth Ja'afar (and indeed his side-musclestrembled as he spoke), "Who told thee that the Palace of Pictureswas illuminated and the windows thrown open?"  "Come hither andsee," replied the Caliph.  Then Ja'afar came close to the Caliphand, looking towards the garden, saw the palace blazing withillumination that rayed through the gloom of the night; and,thinking that this might have been permitted by the keeper forsome reason of his own, he wished to make an excuse for him; soquoth he, "O Commander of the Faithful, Shaykh Ibrahim said to melast week, 'O my lord Ja'afar, I much wish to circumcise my sonsduring the life of the Commander of the Faithful and thy life.' I asked, 'What dost thou want?'; and he answered, 'Get me leavefrom the Caliph to hold the festival in the Garden Palace.' Sosaid I to him, 'Go circumcise them and I will see the Caliph andtell him.'  Thereupon he went away and I forgot to let theeknow."  "O Ja'afar," said the Caliph, "thou hast committed twooffences against me; first in that thou didst no report to me,secondly, thou didst not give him what he sought; for he came andtold thee this only as excuse to ask for some small matter ofmoney, to help him with the outlay; and thou gavest him nothingnor toldest me."  "O Commander of the Faithful," said Ja'afar, "Iforgot."  "Now by the rights of my forefathers and the tombs ofmy forbears," quoth the Caliph, "I will not pass the rest of thisnight save in company with him; for truly he is a pious man whofrequenteth the Elders of the Faith and the Fakirs and otherreligious mendicants and entertaineth them; doubtless they arenot assembled together and it may be that the prayer of one ofthem will work us weal both in this world and in the next. Besides, my presence may profit and at any rate be pleasing toShaykh Ibrahim."  "O Commander of the Faithful," quoth Ja'afar,"the greater part of the night is passed, and at this time theywill be breaking up."  Quoth the Caliph, "It matters not: I needsmust go to them."  So Ja'afar held his peace, being bewilderedand knowing not what to do.  Then the Caliph rose to his feetand, taking with him Ja'afar and Masrur the eunuch sworder, thethree disguised themselves in merchants' gear and leaving theCity-palace, kept threading the streets till they reached thegarden. The Caliph went up to the gate and finding it wide open,was surprised and said, "See, O Ja'afar, how Shaykh Ibrahim hathleft the gate open at this hour contrary to his custom!"  Theywent in and walked on till they came under the pavilion, when theCaliph said, "O Ja'afar, I wish to look in upon them unawaresbefore I show myself, that I may see what they are about and getsight of the elders; for hitherto I have heard no sound fromthem, nor even a Fakir calling upon the name of Allah.[FN#52]" Then he looked about and, seeing a tall walnut-tree, said toJa'afar, "I will climb this tree, for its branches are near thelattices and so look in upon them."  Thereupon he mounted thetree and ceased not climbing from branch to branch, till hereached a bough which was right opposite one of the windows, andhere he took seat and looked inside the palace. He saw a damseland a youth as they were two moons (glory be to Him who createdthem and fashioned them!), and by them Shaykh Ibrahim seated cupin hand and saying, "O Princess of fair ones, drinking withoutmusic is nothing worth; indeed I have heard a poet say,'Round with bit and little, the bowl and cup, * Take either than     moon[FN#53] in his sheen hath crowned:Nor drink without music, for oft I've seen, * The horse drink     best to the whistle's sound!'"When the Caliph saw this, the vein of wrath started up betweenhis eyes and he came down and said to the Wazir, "O Ja'afar,never beheld I yet men of piety in such case; so do thou mountthis tree and look upon them, lest the blessings of the blest belost to thee."  Ja'afar, hearing the words of the Commander ofthe Faithful and being confounded by them, climbed to the tree-top and looking in, saw Nur al-Din and the damsel, and ShaykhIbrahim holding in his hand a brimming bowl.  At this sight hemade sure of death and, descending, stood before the Commander ofthe Faithful, who said to him, "O Ja'afar, praise be to Allah whohath made us of those that observe external ordinances of HolyLaw and hath averted from us the sin of disguising ourselvesafter the manner of hypocrites!"[FN#54]  But Ja'afar could notspeak a word for excess of confusion; so the Caliph looked at himand said, "I wonder how they came hither, and who admitted theminto my pavilion!  But aught like the beauty of this youth andthis damsel my eyes never yet saw!"  "Thou sayest sooth, O ourLord the Sultan!" replied Ja'afar (and he hoped to propitiate theCaliph Harun al-Rashid).  Then quoth the Caliph, "O Ja'afar, letus both mount the branch opposite the window, that we may amuseourselves with looking at them."  So the two climbed the treeand, peering in, heard Shaykh Ibrahim say, "O my lady, I havecast away all gravity mine by the drinking of wine, but 'tis notsweet save with the soft sounds of the lute-strings it combine." "By Allah," replied Anis al-Jalis, "O Shaykh Ibrahim, an we hadbut some instrument of music our joyance were complete."  Hearingthis he rose to his feet and the Caliph said to Ja'afar, "Iwonder what he is about to do!" and Ja'afar answered, "I knownot."  The Shaykh disappeared and presently reappeared bringing alute; and the Caliph took not of it and knew it for that of AbuIshak the Cup-companion.[FN#55]  "By Allah," said the Caliph, "ifthis damsel sing ill I will crucify all of you; but if she singwell I will forgive them and only gibbet thee."  "O Allah causeher to sing vilely!" quoth Ja'afar. Asked the Caliph, "Why so?";and he answered, "If thou crucify us all together, we shall keepone another company."  The Caliph laughed at his speech. Presently the damsel took the lute and, after looking at it andtuning it, she played a measure which made all hearts yearn toher; then she sang these lines,"O ye that can aid me, a wretched lover, * Whom longing burns nor     can rest restore me!Though all you have done I have well deserved, * I take refuge     with you, so exult not o'er me:True, I am weak and low and vile, * But I'll bear your will and     whatso you bore me:My death at your hands what brings it of glory? * I fear but your     sin which of life forlore me!"Quoth the Caliph, "By Allah, good!  O Ja'afar, never in my lifehave I heard a voice so enchanting as this."  "Then haply theCaliph's wrath hath passed away," said Ja'afar, and he replied,"Yes, 'tis gone."  Thereupon they descended from the tree, andthe Caliph said to Ja'afar, "I wish to go in and sit with themand hear the damsel sing before me." "O Commander of theFaithful," replied Ja'afar, "if thou go in to them they will beterribly troubled, and Shaykh Ibrahim will assuredly die offright."  But the Caliph answered, "O Ja'afar, thou must teach mesome device wherewith to delude them and whereby I can foregatherwith them without their knowing me."  So they walked towards theTigris pondering the matter, and presently came upon a fishermanwho stood fishing under the pavilion windows.  Now some timebefore this, the Caliph (being in the pavilion) had called toShaykh Ibrahim and asked him, "What noise is this I hear underthe windows?" and he had answered, "It is voices of fisher folkcatching fish:" so quoth the Caliph, "Go down and forbid themthis place;" and he forbade them accordingly.  However that nighta fisherman named Karim, happening to pass by and seeing thegarden gate open, said to himself, "This is a time of negligence;and I will take advantage of it to do a bit of fishing."  So hetook his net and cast it, but he had hardly done so when behold,the Caliph come up single-handed and, standing hard by, knew himand called aloud to him, "Ho, Karim!"  The fisherman, hearinghimself named, turned round, and seeing the Caliph, trembled andhis side-muscles quivered, as he cried, "By Allah, O Commander ofthe Faithful, I did it not in mockery of the mandate; but povertyand a large family drove me to what thou seest!"  Quoth theCaliph, "Make a cast in my name."  At this the fisherman was gladand going to the bank threw his net, then waiting till it hadspread out at full stretch and settled down, hauled it up andfound in it various kinds of fish.  The Caliph was pleased andsaid, "O Karim, doff thy habit."  So he put off a gaberdine ofcoarse woollen stuff patched in an hundred places whereon thelice were rampant, and a turband which had never been untwistedfor three years but to which he had sown every rag he came upon. The Caliph also pulled off his person two vests of Alexandrianand Ba'lbak silk, a loose inner robe and a long-sleeved outercoat, and said to the fisherman, "Take them and put them on,"while he assumed the foul gaberdine and filthy turband and drew acorner of the head-cloth as a mouth-veil[FN#56] before his face.Then said he to the fisherman, "Get thee about thy business!; andthe man kissed the Caliph's feet and thanked him and improvisedthe following couplets, "Thou hast granted more favours than ever I craved; * Thou hast     satisfied needs which my heart enslaved:I will thank thee and thank whileas life shall last, * And my     bones will praise thee in grave engraved!"Hardly had the fisherman ended his verse, when the lice began tocrawl over the Caliph's skin, and he fell to catching them on hisneck with his right and left and throwing them from him, while hecried, "O fisherman, woe to thee! what be this abundance of liceon thy gaberdine." "O my lord," replied he, "they may annoy theejust at first, but before a week is past thou wilt not feel themnor think of them."  The Caliph laughed and said to him, "Out onthee!  Shall I leave this gaberdine of thine so long on my body?" Quoth the fisherman, "I would say a word to thee but I am ashamedin presence of the Caliph!"; and quoth he, "Say what thou hast tosay."  "It passed through my thought, O Commander of theFaithful," said the fisherman, "that, since thou wishest to learnfishing so thou mayest have in hand an honest trade whereby togain thy livelihood, this my gaberdine besitteth thee rightwell."[FN#57] The Commander of the Faithful laughed at thisspeech, and the fisherman went his way.  Then the Caliph took upthe basket of fish and, strewing a little green grass over it,carried it to Ja'afar and stood before him. Ja'afar thinking himto be Karim the fisherman feared for him and said, "O Karim, whatbrought thee hither?  Flee for thy life, for the Caliph is in thegarden to-night and, if he see thee, thy neck is gone."  At thisthe Caliph laughed and Ja'afar recognized him and asked, "Can itbe thou, our lord the Sultan?"; and he answered, "Yes, O Ja'afar,and thou art my Wazir and I and thou came hither together; yetthou knowest me not; so how should Shaykh Ibrahim know me, and hedrunk?  Stay here, till I came back to thee."  "To hear is toobey," said Ja'afar.  Then the Caliph went up to the door of thepavilion and knocked a gentle knock, whereupon said Nur al-Din,"O Shaykh Ibrahim, some one taps at the door." "Who goes there?"cried the Shaykh and the Caliph replied, "It is I, O ShaykhIbrahim!"  "Who art thou," quoth he, and quoth the other, "I amKarim the fisherman: I hear thou hast a feast, so I have broughtthee some fish, and of a truth 'tis good fish."  When Nur al-Dinheard the mention of fish, he was glad, he and the damsel, andthey both said to the Shaykh, "O our lord, open the door and lethim bring us his fish." So Shaykh Ibrahim opened and the Caliphcame in (and he in fisherman guise), and began by saluting them. Said Shaykh Ibrahim, "Welcome to the blackguard, the robber, thedicer!  Let us see thy fish."  So the Caliph showed them hiscatch and behold, the fishes were still alive and jumping,whereupon the damsel exclaimed, "By Allah!  O my lord, these areindeed fine fish: would they were fried!" and Shaykh Ibrahimrejoined, "By Allah, O my lady, thou art right."  Then said he tothe Caliph, "O fisherman, why didst thou not bring us the fishready fried?  Up now and cook them and bring them back to us." "On my head be thy commands!" said the Caliph, "I will fry thee adish and bring it."  Said they, "Look sharp." Thereupon he wentand ran till he came up to Ja'afar when he called to him, "Hallo,Ja'afar!"; and he replied, "Here am I, O Commander of theFaithful, is all well?"  "They want the fish fried," said theCaliph, and Ja'afar answered, "O Commander of the Faithful, giveit to me and I'll fry it for them."  "By the tombs of myforbears," quoth the Caliph, "none shall fry it but I, with mineown hand!"  So he went to the gardener's hut, where he searchedand found all that he required, even to salt and saffron and wildmarjoram and else besides.  Then he turned to the brasier and,setting on the frying-pan, fried a right good fry.  When it wasdone, he laid it on a banana-leaf, and gathering from the gardenwind-fallen fruits, limes and lemons, carried the fish to thepavilion and set the dish before them.  So the youth and thedamsel and Shaykh Ibrahim came forward and ate; after which theywashed their hands and Nur al-Din said to the Caliph, "By Allah,O fisherman, thou hast done us a right good deed this night." Then he put hand in pouch and, taking out three of the dinarswhich Sanjar had given him, said, "O fisherman, excuse me.  ByAllah had I known thee before that which hath lately befallen me,I had done away the bitterness of poverty from thy heart; buttake thou this as the best I can do for thee."  Then he threw thegold pieces to the Caliph, who took them and kissed them and putthem in pouch. Now his sole object in doing all this was to hearthe damsel sing; so he said to Nur al-Din, "Thou hast rewarded memost liberally, but I beg of thy boundless bounty that thou letthis damsel sing an air, that I may hear her."[FN#58]  So Nur al-Din said, "O Anis al-Jalis!" and she answered "Yes!" and hecontinued, "By my life, sing us something for the sake of thisfisherman who wisheth so much to hear thee." Thereupon she tookthe lute and struck the strings, after she had screwed them tightand tuned them, and sang these improvised verses,"The fawn of a maid hent her lute in hand * And her music made us     right mettlesome:For her song gave hearing to ears stone-deaf, * While Brava!     Brava! exclaimed the dumb."Then she played again and played so ravishingly, that she charmedtheir wits and burst out improvising and singing these couplets,"You have honoured us visiting this our land, * And your     splendour illumined the glooms that blent:So 'tis due that for you I perfume my place * With rose-water,     musk and the camphor-scent!"Hereupon the Caliph was agitated, and emotion so overpowered himthat he could not command himself for excess of pleasure, and heexclaimed, "By Allah, good! by Allah, good! by Allah,good!"[FN#59]  Asked Nur al-Din, "O fisherman, doth this damselplease thee?" and the Caliph answered, "Ay, by Allah!"  Whereuponsaid Nur al-Din, "She is a gift to thee, a gift of the generouswho repenteth him not of his givings and who will never revokehis gift!"  Then he sprang to his feet and, taking a loose robe,threw it over the fisherman and bade him receive the damsel andbe gone.  But she looked at him and said, "O my lord, art thoufaring forth without farewell?  If it must be so, at least staytill I bid thee good-bye and make known my case."  And she beganversifying in these verses, "When love and longing and regret are mine, * Must not this body     show of ills a sign?My love! say not, 'Thou soon shalt be consoled'; * When state     speaks state none shall allay my pine.If living man could swim upon his tears, * I first should float     on waters of these eyne:O thou, who in my heart infusedst thy love, * As water mingles in     the cup with wine,This was the fear I feared, this parting blow. * O thou whose     love my heart-core ne'er shall tyne!O Bin Khakan! my sought, my hope, my will, * O thou whose love     this breast make wholly thine!Against thy lord the King thou sinn'dst for me, * And winnedst     exile in lands peregrine:Allah ne'er make my lord repent my loss * To cream[FN#60] o' men     thou gavest me, one right digne."When she had ended her verses, Nur al-Din answered her with theselines,"She bade me farewell on our parting day, * And she wept in the     fire of our bane and pains:'What wilt thou do when fro' thee I'm gone?' * Quoth I, 'say this     to whom life remains!'"When the Caliph heard her saying in her verse,   "To Karim, the cream of men thou gavest me;"his inclination for her redoubled and it seemed a hard matter anda grievous to part them; so quoth he to the youth, "O my lord,truly the damsel said in her verses that thou didst transgressagainst her master and him who owned her; so tell me, againstwhom didst thou transgress and who is it hath a claim on thee?" "By Allah, O fisherman," replied Nur al-Din, "there befel me andthis damsel a wondrous tale and a marvellous matter: an 't weregraven with needle-gravers on the eye-corners it would be awarner to whoso would be warned."  Cried the Caliph, "Wilt thounot tell me thy story and acquaint me with thy case? Haply it maybring thee relief, for Allah's aid is ever nearhand." "Ofisherman," said Nur al-Din, "Wilt thou hear our history in verseor in prose?"  "Prose is a wordy thing, but verses," rejoined theCaliph, "are pearls on string."  Then Nur al-Din bowed his head,and made these couplets,"O my friend! reft of rest no repose I command, * And my grief is     redoubled in this far land:Erst I had a father, a kinder ne'er was; * But he died and to     Death paid the deodand:When he went from me, every matter went wrong * Till my heart was     nigh-broken, my nature unmanned:He bought me a handmaid, a sweeting who shamed * A wand of the     willow by Zephyr befanned:I lavisht upon her mine heritage, * And spent like a nobleman     puissant and grand:Then to sell her compelled, my sorrow increased; * The parting     was sore but I mote not gainstand:Now as soon as the crier had called her, there bid * A wicked old     fellow, a fiery brand:So I raged with a rage that I could not restrain, * And snatched     her from out of his hireling's hand;When the angry curmudgeon made ready for blows, * And the fire of     a fight kindled he and his band,I smote him in fury with right and with left, * And his hide,     till well satisfied, curried and tanned:Then in fear I fled forth and lay hid in my house, * To escape     from the snares which my foeman had spanned:So the King of the country proclaimed my arrest; * When access to     me a good Chamberlain fand:And warned me to flee from the city afar, * Disappear, disappoint     what my enemies planned:Then we fled from our home 'neath the wing of the night, * And     sought us a refuge by Baghdad strand:Of my riches I've nothing on thee to bestow, * O Fisher, except     the fair gift thou hast scanned:The loved of my soul, and when I from her part, * Know for sure     that I give thee the blood of my heart."[FN#61]When he had ended his verse, the Caliph said to him, "O my lordNur al-Din, explain to me thy case more fully,"  So he told himthe whole story from beginning to end, and the Caliph said tohim, "Whither dost thou now intend?"  "Allah's world is wide,"replied he.  Quoth the Caliph, "I will write thee a letter tocarry to the Sultan Mohammed bin Sulayman al-Zayni, which when hereadeth, he will not hurt nor harm thee in aught." -And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.             When it was the Thirty-eighth Night, She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that whenthe Caliph said to Nur al-Din Ali, "I will write thee a letter tocarry to the Sultan Mohammed bin Sulayman al-Zayni, which when hereadeth, he will not hurt nor harm thee in aught," Nur al-Dinasked "What! is there in the world a fisherman who writeth toKings?  Such a thing can never be!"; and the Caliph answered,"Thou sayest sooth, but I will tell thee the reason. Know that Iand he learnt in the same school under one schoolmaster, and thatI was his monitor.  Since that time Fortune befriended him and heis become a Sultan, while Allah hath abased me and made me afisherman; yet I never send to him to ask aught but he doeth mydesire; nay, though I should ask of him a thousand favours everyday, he would comply." When Nur al-Din heard this he said, "Good!write that I may see." So the Caliph took ink-case and reed-penand wrote as follows,--"In the name of Allah, theCompassionating, the Compassionate!  But after.[FN#62] Thisletter is written by Harun al-Rashid, son of Al-Mahdi, to hishighness Mohammed bin Sulayman al-Zayni, whom I have encompassedabout with my favour and made my viceroy in certain of mydominions.  The bearer of these presents is Nur al-Din Ali, sonof Fazl bin Khakan the Wazir. As soon as they come to thy handdivest thyself forthright of the kingly dignity and invest himtherewith; so oppose not my commandment and peace be with thee." He gave the letter to Nur al-Din, who took it and kissed it, thenput it in his turband and set out at once on his journey. So farconcerning him; but as regards the Caliph, Shaykh Ibrahim staredto him (and he still in fisher garb) and said, "O vilest offishermen, thou hast brought us a couple of fish worth a score ofhalf-dirhams,[FN#63] and hast gotten three dinars for them; andthinkest thou to take the damsel to boot?"  When the Caliph heardthis, he cried out at him, and signed to Masrur who discoveredhimself and rushed in upon him. Now Ja'afar had sent one of thegardener-lads to the doorkeeper of the palace to fetch a suit ofroyal raiment for the Prince of the Faithful; so the man wentand, returning with the suit, kissed the ground before the Caliphand gave it him.  Then he threw of the clothes he had on[FN#64]and donned kingly apparel.  Shaykh Ibrahim was still sitting uponhis chair and the Caliph tarried to behold what would come next. But seeing the Fisherman become the Caliph, Shaykh Ibrahim wasutterly confounded and he could do nothing but bite his finger-ends[FN#65] and say, "Would I knew whether am I asleep or am Iawake!"  At last the Caliph looked at him and cried, "O ShaykhIbrahim, what state is this in which I see thee?" Thereupon herecovered from his drunkenness and, throwing himself upon theground, repeated these verses,"Pardon the sinful ways I did pursue; * Ruth from his lord to     every slave is due:Confession pays the fine that sin demands; * Where, then, is that     which grace and mercy sue?"[FN#66]The Caliph forgave him and bade carry the damsel to the city-palace, where he set apart for her an apartment and appointedslaves to serve her, saying to her, "Know that we have sent thylord to be Sultan in Bassorah and, Almighty Allah willing, wewill dispatch him the dress of investiture and thee with it." Meanwhile, Nur al-Din Ali ceased not travelling till he reachedBassorah, where he repaired to the Sultan's palace and he shouteda long shout.[FN#67]  The Sultan heard him and sent for him; andwhen he came into his presence, he kissed the ground between hishands and, producing the letter, presented it to him.  Seeing thesuperscription in the writing of the Commander of the Faithful,the Sultan rose to his feet and kissed it three times; and afterreading it said, "I hear and I obey Allah Almighty and theCommander of the Faithful!"  Then he summoned the fourKazis[FN#68] and the Emirs and was about to divest himself of therule royal, when behold, in came Al Mu'in bin Sawi.  The Sultangave him the Caliph's letter and he read it, then tore it topieces and putting it into his mouth, chewed it[FN#69] and spatit out.  "Woe to thee," quoth the Sultan (and indeed he was soreangered); "what induced thee to do this deed?"  "Now by thy life!O our lord the Sultan," replied Mu'in, "this man hath neverforegathered with the Caliph nor with his Wazir; but he is agallows-bird, a limb of Satan, a knave who, having come upon awritten paper in the Caliph's hand, some idle scroll, hath madeit serve his own end.  The Caliph would surely not send him totake the Sultanate from thee without the imperialautograph[FN#70] and the diploma of investiture, and he certainlywould have despatched with him a Chamberlain or a Minister.  Buthe hath come alone and he never came from the Caliph, no, never!never! never!"  "What is to be done?" asked the Sultan, and theMinister answered, "Leave him to me and I will take him and keephim away from thee, and send him in charge of a Chamberlain toBaghdad-city.  Then, if what he says be sooth, they will bring usback autograph and investiture; and if not, I will take my dueout of this debtor."  When the Sultan heard the Minister's wordshe said, "Hence with thee and him too." Al Mu'in took trust ofhim from the King and, carrying him to his own house, cried outto his pages who laid him flat and beat him till he fainted. Then he let put upon his feet heavy shackles and carried him tothe jail, where he called the jailor, one Kutayt,[FN#71] who cameand kissed the ground before him.  Quoth the Wazir, "O Kutayt, Iwish thee to take this fellow and throw him into one of theunderground cells[FN#72] in the prison and torture him night andday."  "To hear is to obey," replied the jailor and, taking Nural-Din into the prison, locked the door upon him.  Then he gaveorders to sweep a bench behind the door and, spreading on it asitting-rug and a leather-cloth, seated Nur al-Din thereon andloosed his shackles and entreated him kindly.  The Wazir sentevery day enjoining the jailor to beat him, but he abstained fromthis, and so continued to do for forty days.  On the forty-firstday there came a present from the Caliph; which when the Sultansaw, it pleased him and he consulted his Ministers on the matter,when one of them said, "Perchance this present was for the newSultan."  Cried Al-Mu'in, "We should have done well had we puthim to death at his first coming;" and the Sultan cried "ByAllah, thou hast reminded me of him!  Go down to the prison andfetch him, and I will strike off his head."  "To hear is toobey," replied Al-Mu'in: then he stood up and said, "I will makeproclamation in the city:--Whoso would solace himself with seeingthe beheading of Nur al-Din bin al-Fazl bin Khakan, let himrepair to the palace!  So follower and followed, great and smallwill flock to the spectacle, and I shall heal my heart and harmmy foe."  "Do as thou wilt," said the Sultan.  The Wazir went off(and he was glad and gay), and ordered the Chief of Police tomake the afore-mentioned proclamation. When the people heard thecrier, they all sorrowed and wept, even the little ones at schooland the traders in their shops; and some strove to get places forseeing the sight, whilst others went to the prison with theobject of escorting him thence.  Presently, the Wazir came withten Mamelukes to the jail and Kutayt the jailor asked him, "Whomseekest thou, O our lord the Wazir?"; whereto he answered, "Bringme out that gallows- bird."  But the jailor said, "He is in thesorriest of plights for the much beating I have given him."  Thenhe went into the prison and found Nur al-Din repeating theseverses,"Who shall support me in calamities, * When fail all cures and     greater cares arise?Exile hath worm my heart, my vitals torn;   The World to foes     hath turned my firm allies.O folk, will not one friend amidst you all * Wail o'er my woes,     and cry to hear my cries?Death and it agonies seem light to me, * Since life has lost all     joys and jollities:O Lord of Mustafa,[FN#73] that Science-sea, * Sole Intercessor,     Guide all-ware, all-wise!I pray thee free me and my fault forego, * And from me drive mine     evil and my woe."The jailor stripped off his clean clothes and, dressing him intwo filthy vests, carried him to the Wazir.  Nur al-Din looked athim and saw it was his foe that sought to compass his death; sohe wept and said, "Art thou, then, so secure against the World? Hast thou not heard the saying of the poet,'Kisras and Caesars in a bygone day * Stored wealth; where it is,     and ah! where are they?'O Wazir," he continued, "know that Allah (be He extolled andexalted!) will do whatso He will!"  "O Ali," replied he,"thinkest thou to frighten me with such talk?  I mean this veryday to smite thy neck despite the noses of the Bassorah folk andI care not; let the days do as they please; nor will I turn me tothy counsel but rather to what the poet saith,'Leave thou the days to breed their ban and bate, * And make thee     strong t' upbear the weight of Fate.'And also how excellently saith another,'Whoso shall see the death-day of his foe, * One day surviving,     wins his bestest wish.'"Then he ordered his attendants to mount Nur al-Din upon the bareback of a mule; and they said to the youth (for truly it wasirksome to them), "Let us stone him and cut him down thou ourlives go for it."  But Nur al-Din said to them, "Do not so: haveye not heard the saying of the poet,'Needs must I bear the term by Fate decreed, * And when that day     be dead needs must I die:If lions dragged me to their forest-lair, * Safe should I live     till draw my death-day nigh.'"Then they proceeded to proclaim before Nur al-Din, "This is theleast of the retribution for him who imposeth upon Kings withforgeries."  And they ceased not parading him round aboutBassorah, till they made him stand beneath the palace-windows andset him upon the leather of blood,[FN#74] and the sworder came upto him and said, "O my lord, I am but a slave commanded in thismatter: an thou have any desire, tell it me that I may fulfil it,for now there remaineth of they life only so much as may be tillthe Sultan shall put his face out of the lattice."  Thereupon Nural-Din looked to the right and to the left, and before him andbehind him and began improvising,"The sword, the sworder and the blood-skin waiting me I sight, *     And cry, Alack, mine evil fate! ah, my calamity!How is't I see no loving friend with eye of sense or soul? *     What! no one here? I cry to all: will none reply to me?The time is past that formed my life, my death term draweth nigh,     * Will no man win the grace of God showing me clemency;And look with pity on my state, and clear my dark despair, * E'en     with a draught of water dealt to cool death's agony?"The people fell to weeping over him; and the headsman rose andbrought him a draught of water; but the Wazir sprang up from hisplace and smote the gugglet with his hand and broke it: then hecried out at the executioner and bade him strike off Nur al-Din'shead.  So he bound the eyes of the doomed man and folk clamouredat the Wazir and loud wailings were heard and much questioning ofman and man.  At this moment behold, rose a dense dust-cloudfilling sky and wold; and when the Sultan, who was sitting in thepalace, descried this, he said to his suite, "Go and see what yoncloud bringeth:"  Replied Al Mu'in, "Not till we have smittenthis fellow's neck;" but the Sultan said, "Wait ye till we seewhat this meaneth."  Now the dust-cloud was the dust of J'afarthe Barmecide, Wazir to the Caliph, and his host; and the causeof his coming was as follows.  The Caliph passed thirty dayswithout calling to mind the matter of Nur al-Din Ali,[FN#75] andnone reminded him of it, till one night, as he passed by thechamber of Anis al-Jalis, he heard her weeping and singing with asoft sweet voice these lines of the poet,"In thought I see thy form when farthest far or nearest near; *     And on my tongue there dwells a name which man shall ne'er     unhear."Then her weeping redoubled; when lo! the Caliph opened the doorand, entering the chamber, found Anis al-Jalis in tears.  Whenshe saw him she fell to the ground and kissing his feet threetimes repeated these lines,"O fertile root and noble growth of trunk; * Ripe-fruitful branch     of never sullied race;I mind thee of what pact thy bounty made; * Far be 't from thee     thou should'st forget my case!"Quoth the Caliph, "Who art thou?" and she replied, "I am she whomAli bin Khakan gave thee in gift, and I wish the fulfilment ofthy promise to send me to him with the robe of honour; for I havenow been thirty days without tasting the food of sleep." Thereupon the Caliph sent for Ja'afar and said to him, "OJa'afar, 'tis thirty days since we have had news of Nur al-Dinbin Khakan, and I cannot suppose that the Sultan hath slain him;but, by the life of my head and by the sepulchres of myforefathers, if aught of foul play hath befallen him, I willsurely make an end of him who was the cause of it, though he bethe dearest of all men to myself! So I desire that thou set outfor Bassorah within this hour and bring me tidings of my cousin,King Mohammed bin Sulayman al-Zayni, and how he had dealt withNur al-Din Ali bin Khakan;" adding, "If thou tarry longer on theroad than shall suffice for the journey, I will strike off theyhead. Furthermore, do thou tell the son of my uncle the wholestory of Nur al-Din, and how I sent him with my written orders;and if thou find, O my cousin,[FN#76] that the King hath doneotherwise than as I commanded, bring him and the Wazir Al-Mu'inbin Sawi to us in whatsoever guise thou shalt find them."[FN#77] "Hearing and obedience," replied Ja'afar and, making ready on theinstant, he set out for Bassorah where the news of his coming hadforegone him and had reached to the ears of King Mohammed. WhenJa'afar arrived and saw the crushing and crowding of the lieges,he asked, "What means all this gathering?" so they told him whatwas doing in the matter of Nur al-Din; whereupon he hastened togo to the Sultan and saluting him, acquainted him with the causewhy he came and the Caliph's resolve, in case of any foul playhaving befallen the youth, to put to death whoso should havebrought it about.  Then he took into custody the King and theWazir and laid them in ward and, giving order for the release ofNur al-Din Ali, enthroned him as Sultan in the stead of Mohammedbin Sulayman.  After this Ja'afar abode three days in Bassorah,the usual guest-time, and on the morning of the fourth day, Nural-Din Ali turned to him and said, "I long for the sight of theCommander of the Faithful." Then said Ja'afar to Mohammed binSulayman, "Make ready to travel, for we will say the dawn-prayerand mount Baghdad-wards;" and he replied, "To hear is to obey." Then they prayed and they took horse and set out, all of them,carrying with them the Wazir, Al-Mu'in bin Sawi, who began torepent him of what he had done.  Nur al-Din rode by Ja'afar'sside and they stinted not faring on till they arrived at Baghdad,the House of Peace, and going in to the Caliph told him how theyhad found Nur al-Din nigh upon death.  Thereupon the Caliph saidto the youth, "Take this sword and smite with it the neck ofthine enemy."  So he took the sword from his hand and stepped upto Al-Mu'in who looked at him and said, "I did according to mymother's milk, do thou according to thine."[FN#78] Upon this Nural-Din cast the sword from his hand and said to the Caliph, "OCommander of the Faithful, he hath beguiled me with his words;"and he repeated this couplet,"By craft and sleight I snared him when he came; * A few fair     words aye trap the noble-game!""Leave him then," cried the Caliph and, turning to Masrur said,"Rise thou and smite his neck."  So Masrur drew his sword andstruck off his head. Then quoth the Caliph to Nur al-Din Ali,"Ask a boon of me."  "O my lord," answered he, "I have no need ofthe Kingship of Bassorah; my sole desire is to be honoured byserving thee and by seeing the countenance." "With love andgladness," said the Caliph.  Then he sent for the damsel, Anisal-Jalis, and bestowed plentiful favours upon them both and gavethem one of his palaces in Baghdad, and assigned stipends andallowances, and made Nur al-Din Ali bin Fazl bin Khakan, one ofhis cup-companions; and he abode with the Commander of theFaithful enjoying the pleasantest of lives till death overtookhim.  "Yet (continued Shahrazad) is not his story in any wisemore wondrous than the history of the merchant and his children." The King asked "And what was that?" and Shahrazad began to relatetheTale of Ghanim bin Ayyub[FN#79], the Distraught, the Thrall o'Love.It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that in times of yore andin years and ages long gone before, there lived in Damascus amerchant among the merchants, a wealthy man who had a son likethe moon on the night of his fulness[FN#80] and withal sweet ofspeech, who was named Ghanim bin 'Ayyub, surnamed the Distraught,the Thrall o' Love. He had also a daughter, own sister to Ghanim,who was called Fitnah, a damsel unique in beauty and loveliness.Their father died and left them abundant wealth.--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the Thirty-ninth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that themerchant left his two children abundant wealth and amongst otherthings an hundred loads[FN#81] of silks and brocades, musk podsand mother o' pearl; and there was written on every bale, "Thisis of the packages intended for Baghdad," it having been hispurpose to make the journey thither, when Almighty Allah took himto Himself, which was in the time of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid.After a while his son took the loads and, bidding farewell to hismother and kindred and townsfolk, went forth with a company ofmerchants, putting his trust in Allah Almighty, who decreed himsafety, so that he arrived without let or stay at Baghdad. Therehe hired for himself a fair dwelling house which he furnishedwith carpets and cushions, curtains and hangings; and thereinstored his bales and stabled his mules and camels, after which heabode a while resting. Presently the merchants and notables ofBaghdad came and saluted him, after which he took a bundlecontaining ten pieces of costly stuffs, with the prices writtenon them, and carried it to the merchants' bazar, where theywelcomed and saluted him and showed him all honour; and, makinghim dismount from his beast, seated him in the shop of the Syndicof the market, to whom he delivered the package. He opened itand, drawing out the pieces of stuff, sold them for him at aprofit of two diners on every diner of prime cost. At this Ghanimrejoiced and kept selling his silks and stuffs one after another,and ceased not to do on this wise for a full year. On the firstday of the following year he went, as was his wont, to theExchange which was in the bazar, but found the gate shut; andenquiring the reason was told, "One of the merchants is dead andall the others have gone to follow his bier,[FN#82] and whyshouldst thou not win the meed of good deeds by walking withthem?"[FN#83] He replied "Yes," and asked for the quarter wherethe funeral was taking place, and one directed him thereto. So hepurified himself by the Wuzu-ablution[FN#84] and repaired withthe other merchants to the oratory, where they prayed over thedead, then walked before the bier to the burial place, andGhanim, who was a bashful man, followed them being ashamed toleave them. They presently issued from the city, and passedthrough the tombs until they reached the grave where they foundthat the deceased's kith and kin had pitched a tent over the tomband had brought thither lamps and wax candles. So they buried thebody and sat down while the readers read out and recited theKoran over the grave; and Ghanim sat with them, being overcomewith bashfulness and saying to himself "I cannot well go awaytill they do." They tarried listening to the Koranic perfectiontill nightfall, when the servants set supper andsweetmeats[FN#85] before them and they ate till they weresatisfied; then they washed their hands and again took theirplaces. But Ghanim's mind was preoccupied with his house andgoods, being in fear of robbers, and he said to himself, "I am astranger here and supposed to have money; if I pass the nightabroad the thieves will steal my money bags and my bales toboot." So when he could no longer control his fear he arose andleft the assembly, having first asked leave to go about someurgent business; and following the signs of the road he soon cameto the city gate. But it was midnight and he found the doorslocked and saw none going or coming nor heard aught but thehounds baying and the wolves howling. At this he exclaimed,"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! I wasin fear for my property and came back on its account, but now Ifind the gate shut and I am in mortal fear for my life!" Then heturned back and, looking out for a place where he could sleeptill morning, presently found a Santon's tomb, a square of fourwalls with a date-tree in the central court and a granitegateway. The door was wide open; so he entered and would fainhave slept, but sleep came not to him; and terror and a sense ofdesolation oppressed him for that he was alone amidst the tombs.So he rose to his feet and, opening the door, looked out and lo!he was ware of a light afar off in the direction of the citygate; then walking a little way towards it, he saw that it was onthe road whereby he had reached the tomb. This made him fear forhis life, so he hastily shut the door and climbed to the top ofthe dale tree where he hid himself in the heart of the fronds.The light came nearer and nearer till it was close to the tomb;then it stopped and he saw three slaves, two bearing a chest andone with a lanthorn, an adze and a basket containing some mortar.When they reached the tomb, one of those who were carrying thecase said, "What aileth thee O Sawab?"; and said the other, "Whatis the matter O Kafur?"[FN#86] Quoth he, "Were we not here atsupper tide and did we not leave the door open?" "Yes," repliedthe other, "that is true.'' "See," said Kafur, "now it is shutand barred." "How weak are your wits!" cried the third who borethe adze and his name was Bukhayt,[FN#87] "know ye not that theowners of the gardens use to come out from Baghdad and tend themand, when evening closes upon them, they enter this place andshut the door, for fear lest the wicked blackmen, like ourselves,should catch them and roast 'em and eat 'em."[FN#88] "Thou sayestsooth," said the two others, "but by Allah, however that may be,none amongst us is weaker of wits than thou." "If ye do notbelieve me," said Bukhayt, "let us enter the tomb and I willrouse the rat for you; for I doubt not but that, when he saw thelight and us making for the place, he ran up the date tree andhid there for fear of us." When Ghanim heard this, he said inhimself, "O curstest of slaves! May Allah not have thee in Hisholy keeping for this thy craft and keenness of wit! There is noMajesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, theGreat! How shall I win free of these blackamoors?" Then said thetwo who bore the box to him of the adze, "Swarm up the wall andopen the gate for us, O Bukhayt, for we are tired of carrying thechest on our necks; and when thou hast opened the gate thou shalthave one of those we catch inside, a fine fat rat which we willfry for thee after such excellent fashion that not a speck of hisfat shall be lost." But Bukhayt answered, "I am afraid ofsomewhat which my weak wits have suggested to me: we should dobetter to throw the chest over the gateway; for it is ourtreasure." "If we throw it 'twill break," replied they; and hesaid, "I fear lest there be robbers within who murder folk andplunder their goods, for evening is their time of entering suchplaces and dividing their spoil." "O thou weak o' wits," saidboth the bearers of the box, "how could they ever get inhere!"[FN#89] Then they set down the chest and climbing over thewall dropped inside and opened the gate, whilst the third slave(he that was called Bukhayt) stood by them holding the adze, thelanthorn and the hand basket containing the mortar. After thisthey locked the gate and sat down; and presently one of themsaid, "O my brethren, we are wearied with walking and withlifting up and setting down the chest, and with unlocking andlocking the gate; and now 'tis midnight, and we have no breathleft to open a tomb and bury the box: so let us rest here two orthree hours, then rise and do the job. Meanwhile each of us shalltell how he came to be castrated and all that befel him fromfirst to last, the better to pass away our time while we take ourrest." Thereupon the first, he of the lanthorn and whose name wasBukhayt, said, "I'll tell you my tale." "Say on," replied they;so he began as follows theTale of the First Eunuch, Bukhayt.Know, O my brothers, that when I was a little one, some fiveyears old, I was taken home from my native country by a slavedriver who sold me to a certain Apparitor.[FN#90] My purchaserhad a daughter three years old, with whom I was brought up; andthey used to make mock of me, letting me play with her and dancefor her[FN#91] and sing to her, till I reached the age of twelveand she that of ten; and even then they did not forbid me seeingher. One day I went in to her and found her sitting in an innerroom, and she looked as if she had just come out of the bathwhich was in the house; for she was scented with essences andreek of aromatic woods, and her face shone like a circle of themoon on the fourteenth night. She began to sport with me, and Iwith her. Now I had just reached the age of puberty; so myprickle stood at point, as it were a huge key. Then she threw meon my back and, mounting astraddle on my breast, fell a wrigglingand a bucking upon me till she had uncovered my yard. When shesaw it standing with head erect, she hent it in hand and beganrubbing it upon the lips of her little slit[FN#92] outside herpetticoat trousers. Thereat hot lust stirred in me and I threw myarms round her, while she wound hers about my neck and hugged meto her with all her might, till, before I knew what I did, mypizzle split up her trousers and entered her slit and did awayher maiden head. When I saw this, I ran off and took refuge withone of my comrades. Presently her mother came in to her; and,seeing her in this case, fainted clean away. However she managedthe matter advisedly and hid it from the girl's father out ofgood will to me; nor did they cease to call to me and coax me,till they took me from where I was. After two months had passedby, her mother married her to a young man, a barber who used toshave her papa, and portioned and fitted her out of her ownmonies; whilst the father knew nothing of what had passed. On thenight of consummation they cut the throat of a pigeon poult andsprinkled the blood on her shift.[FN#93] After a while theyseized me unawares and gelded me; and, when they brought her toher bridegroom, they made me her Agha,[FN#94] her eunuch, to walkbefore her wheresoever she went, whether to the bath or to herfather's house. I abode with her a long time enjoying her beautyand loveliness by way of kissing and clipping and coupling withher,[FN#95] till she died, and her husband and mother and fatherdied also; when they seized me for the Royal Treasury as beingthe property of an intestate, and I found my way hither, where Ibecame your comrade. This, then, O my brethren, is the cause ofmy cullions being cut off; and peace be with you! He ceased andhis fellow began in these words theTale of the Second Eunuch, Kafur.Know, O my brothers that, when beginning service as a boy ofeight, I used to tell the slave dealers regularly and exactly onelie every year, so that they fell out with one another, till atlast my master lost patience with me and, carrying me down to themarket, ordered the brokers to cry, "Who will buy this slave,knowing his blemish and making allowance for it?" He did so andthey asked him, "Pray, what may be his blemish?" and he answered,"He telleth me one single lie every year." Now a man that was amerchant came up and said to the broker, "How much do they allowfor him with his blemish?" "They allow six hundred dirhams," hereplied; and said the other, "Thou shalt have twenty dirhams forthyself." So he arranged between him and the slave dealer whotook the coin from him and the broker carried me to themerchant's house and departed, after receiving his brokerage. Thetrader clothed me with suitable dress, and I stayed in hisservice the rest of my twelvemonth, until the new year beganhappily. It was a blessed season, plenteous in the produce of theearth, and the merchants used to feast every day at the house ofsome one among them, till it was my master's turn to entertainthem in a flower garden without the city. So he and the othermerchants went to the garden, taking with them all that theyrequired of provaunt and else beside, and sat eating andcarousing and drinking till mid day, when my master, having needof some matter from his home, said to me, "O slave, mount the shemule and hie thee to the house and bring from thy mistress suchand such a thing and return quickly." I obeyed his bidding andstarted for the house but, as I drew near it, I began to cry outand shed tears, whereupon all the people of the quartercollected, great and small; and my master's wife and daughters,hearing the noise I was making, opened the door and asked me whatwas the matter. Said I, "My master was sitting with his friendsbeneath an old wall, and it fell on one and all of them; and whenI saw what had happened to them, I mounted the mule and camehither in haste to tell you." When my master's daughters and wifeheard this, they screamed and rent their raiment and beat theirfaces, whilst the neighbours came around them. Then the wife overturned the furniture of the house, one thing upon another, andtore down the shelves and broke the windows and the lattices andsmeared the walls with mud and indigo, saying to me, "Woe tothee, O Kafur! come help me to tear down these cupboards andbreak up these vessels and this china ware,[FN#96] and the restof it." So I went to her and aided her to smash all the shelvesin the house with whatever stood upon them, after which I wentround about the terrace roofs and every part of the place,spoiling all I could and leaving no china in the house unbrokentill I had laid waste the whole, crying out the while "Well away!my master!" Then my mistress fared forth bare faced wearing ahead kerchief and naught else, and her daughters and the childrensallied out with her, and said to me, "O Kafur, go thou before usand show us the place where thy master lieth dead, that we maytake him from under the fallen wall and lay him on a bier andbear him to the house and give him a fine funeral." So I wentforth before them crying out, "Slack, my master!"; and they afterme with faces and heads bare and all shrieking, "Alas! Alas forthe man!" Now there remained none in the quarter, neither man norwoman, nor epicene, nor youth nor maid, nor child nor old trot,but went with us smiting their faces and weeping bitterly, and Iled them leisurely through the whole city. The folk asked themwhat was the matter, whereupon they told them what they had heardfrom me, and all exclaimed, "There is no Majesty and there is noMight save in Allah!" Then said one of them, "He was a personageof consequence; so let us go to the Governor and tell him whathath befallen him." When they told the Governor,--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.             When it was the Fortieth Night,[FN#97]She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theytold the Governor, he rose and mounted and, taking with himlabourers, with spades and baskets, went on my track, with manypeople behind him; and I ran on before them, howling and castingdust on my head and beating my face, followed by my mistress andher children keening for the dead. But I got ahead of them andentered the garden before them, and when my master saw me in thisstate, I smiting my face and saying, "Well away! my mistress!Alas! Alas! Alas! who is left to take pity on me, now that mymistress is gone? Would I had been a sacrifice for her!", hestood aghast and his colour waxed yellow and he said to me, "Whataileth thee O Kafur! What is the matter?" "O my lord," I replied,"when thou sentest me to the house, I found that the saloon wallhad given way and had fallen like a layer upon my mistress andher children!" "And did not thy mistress escape?" "No, by Allah,O my master; not one of them was saved; the first to die was mymistress, thine elder daughter!" "And did not my younger daughterescape?"; "No, she did not!" "And what became of the mare mule Iuse to ride, is she safe?" "No, by Allah, O my master, the housewalls and the stable walls buried every living thing that waswithin doors, even to the sheep and geese and poultry, so thatthey all became a heap of flesh and the dogs and cats are eatingthem and not one of them is left alive." "And hath not thymaster, my elder son, escaped?" "No, by Allah! not one of themwas saved, and now there is naught left of house or household,nor even a sign of them: and, as for the sheep and geese andhens, the cats and dogs have devoured them." When my master heardthis the light became night before his sight; his wits were dazedand he so lost command of his senses that he could not stand firmon his feet: he was as one struck with a sudden palsy and hisback was like to break. Then he rent his raiment and plucked outhis beard and, casting his turband from off his head, buffetedhis face till the blood ran down and he cried aloud, "Alas, mychildren! Alas, my wife! Alas, my calamity! To whom ever befelthat which hath befallen me?" The merchants, his friends, alsocried aloud at his crying and wept for his weeping and tore theirclothes, being moved to pity of his case; and so my master wentout of the garden, smiting his face with such violence that fromexcess of pain he staggered like one drunken with wine. As he andthe merchants came forth from the garden gate, behold, they saw agreat cloud of dust and heard a loud noise of crying andlamentation; so they looked and lo! it was the Governor with hisattendants and the townsfolk, a world of people, who had come outto look on, and my master's family following them, all screamingand crying aloud and weeping exceeding sore weeping. The first toaddress my owner were his wife and children; and when he saw themhe was confounded and laughed[FN#98] and said to them, "How is itwith all of you and what befel you in the house and what hathcome to pass to you?" When they saw him they exclaimed, "Praisebe to Allah for thy preservation!" and threw themselves upon himand his children hung about him crying, "Slack, our father!Thanks to Allah for thy safety, O our father!" And his wife saidto him, "Art thou indeed well! Laud to Allah who hath shown usthy face in safety!" And indeed she was confounded and her reasonfled when she saw him, and she asked, "O, my lord, how didst thouescape, thou and thy friends the merchants?"; and he answeredher, "And how fared it with thee in the house?" Quoth they, "Wewere all well, whole and healthy, nor hath aught of evil befallenus in the house, save that thy slave Kafur came to us, bareheadedwith torn garments and howling, 'Alas, the master! Alas themaster!' So we asked him, 'What tidings, O Kafur?' and heanswered 'A wall of the garden hath fallen on my master and hisfriends the merchants, and they are all crushed and dead!''' "ByAllah," said my master, "he came to me but now howling, 'Alas, mymistress! Alas, the children of the mistress!', and said, 'Mymistress and her children are all dead, every one of them!'" Thenhe looked round and seeing me with my turband rent in rags roundmy neck, howling and weeping with exceeding weeping and throwingdust upon my head, he cried out at me. So I came to him and hesaid, "Woe to thee, O ill omened slave! O whoreson knave! O thoudamned breed! What mischief thou hast wrought? By Allah! I willflog thy skin from thy flesh and cut thy flesh from thy bones!" Irejoined, "By Allah, thou canst do nothing of the kind with me, Omy lord, for thou boughtest me with my blemish; and there arehonest men to bear witness against thee that thou didst soaccepting the condition, and that thou knewest of my fault whichis to tell one lie every year. Now this is only a half lie, butby the end of the year I will tell the other half, then will thelie stand whole and complete." "O dog, son of a dog!", cried mymaster, "O most accursed of slaves, is this all of it but a halflie? Verily if it be a half lie 'tis a whole calamity! Get theefrom me, thou art free in the face of Allah!" "By Allah,"rejoined I, if thou free me, I will not free thee till my year iscompleted and I have told thee the half lie which is left. Whenthis is done, go down with me to the slave market and sell me asthou boughtest me to whoso will buy me with my blemish; but thoushalt not manumit me, for I have no handicraft whereby to gain myliving;[FN#99] and this my demand is a matter of law which thedoctors have laid down in the Chapter of Emancipation."[FN#100]While we were at these words, up came the crowd of people, andthe neighbours of the quarter, men, women and children, togetherwith the Governor and his suite offering condolence. So my masterand the other merchants went up to him and informed him of theadventure, and how this was but a half lie, at which allwondered, deeming it a whole lie and a big one. And they cursedme and reviled me, while I stood laughing and grinning at them,till at last I asked, "How shall my master slay me when he boughtme with this my blemish?" Then my master returned home and foundhis house in ruins, and it was I who had laid waste the greaterpart of it,[FN#101] having broken things which were worth muchmoney, as also had done his wife, who said to him, "'Twas Kafurwho broke the vessels and chinaware." Thereupon his rageredoubled and he struck hand upon hand exclaiming, "By Allah! inmy life never saw I a whoreson like this slave; and he saith thisis but a half lie! How, then, if he had told me a whole lie? Hewould ruin a city, aye or even two." Then in his fury he went tothe Governor, and they gave me a neat thing in the bastinado-lineand made me eat stick till I was lost to the world and a faintingfit came on me; and, whilst I was yet senseless, they brought thebarber who docked me and gelded me[FN#102] and cauterised thewound. When I revived I found myself a clean eunuch with nothingleft, and my master said to me, "Even as thou hast burned myheart for the things I held dearest, so have I burnt thy heartfor that of thy members whereby thou settest most store!" Then hetook me and sold me at a profit, for that I was become an eunuch.And I ceased not bringing trouble upon all, wherever I was sold,and was shifted from lord to lord and from notable to notable,being sold and being bought, till I entered the palace of theCommander of the Faithful. But now my spirit is broken and mytricks are gone from me, so alas! are my ballocks. When the twoslaves heard his history, they laughed at him and chaffed him andsaid, "Truly thou art skite[FN#103] and skite-son! Thou liedestan odious lie." Then quoth they to the third slave, "Tell us thytale." "O sons of my uncle," quoth he, "all that ye have said isidle: I will tell you the cause of my losing my testicles, andindeed I deserved to lose even more, for I futtered both mymistress and my master's eldest son and heir: but my story is along one and this is not the time to tell it; for the dawn, O mycousins, draweth near and if morning come upon us with this cheststill unburied, we shall get into sore disgrace and our liveswill pay for it. So up with you and open the door and, when weget back to the palace, I will tell you my story and the cause ofmy losing my precious stones." Then he swarmed up and droppeddown from the wall inside and opened the door, so they enteredand, setting down the lantern, dug between four tombs a hole aslong as the chest and of the same breadth. Kafur plied the spadeand Sawab removed the earth by baskets full till they reached thedepth of the stature of a man;[FN#104] when they laid the chestin the hole and threw back the earth over it: then they wentforth and shutting the door disappeared from Ghanim's eyes. Whenall was quiet and he felt sure that he was left alone in theplace, his thought was busied about what the chest contained andhe said to himself, "Would that I knew the contents of that box!"However, he waited till day broke, when morning shone and showedher sheen: whereupon he came down from the date tree and scoopedaway the earth with his hands, till the box was laid bare anddisengaged from the ground. Then he took a large stone andhammered at the lock till he broke it and, opening the lid,behold a young lady, a model of beauty and loveliness, clad inthe richest of garments and jewels of gold and such necklaces ofprecious stones that, were the Sultan's country evened with them,it would not pay their price. She had been drugged with Bhang,but her bosom, rising and falling, showed that her breath had notdeparted. When Ghanim saw her, he knew that some one had playedher false and hocussed her; so he pulled her out of the chest andlaid her on the ground with her face upwards. As soon as shesmelt the breeze and the air entered her nostrils, mouth andlungs, she sneezed and choked and coughed; when there fell fromout her throat a pill of Cretan Bhang, had an elephant smelt ithe would have slept from night to night. Then she opened her eyesand glancing around said, in sweet voice and gracious words, "Woeto thee O wind! there is naught in thee to satisfy the thirsty,nor aught to gratify one whose thirst is satisfied! Where is Zharal-Bostan?" But no one answered her, so she turned her and criedout, "Ho Sabihah! Shajarat al-Durr! Nur al-Huda! Najmat al-Subh!be ye awake? Shahwah, Nuzhab, Halwa, Zarifah, out on you,speak![FN#105]'' But no one answered; so she looked all aroundand said, "Woe's me! have they entombed me in the tombs? O Thouwho knowest what man's thought enwombs and who givestcompensation on the Day of Doom, who can have brought me fromamid hanging screens and curtains veiling the Harim rooms and setme down between four tombs?" All this while Ghanim was standingby: then he said to her, "O my lady, here are neither screenedrooms nor palace Harims nor yet tombs; only the slave henceforthdevoted to thy love, Ghanim bin Ayyub, sent to thee by theOmniscient One above, that all thy troubles He may remove and winfor thee every wish that cloth behove!" Then he held his peace.She was reassured by his words and cried, "I testify that thereis no god but the God and I testify that Mohammed is the Apostleof God!"; then she turned to Ghanim and, placing her hands beforeher face, said to him in the sweetest speech, "O blessed youth,who brought me hither? See, I am now come to myself." "O mylady," he replied, "three slave eunuchs came here bearing thischest;" and related to her the whole of what had befallen him,and how evening having closed upon him had proved the cause ofher preservation, otherwise she had died smothered.[FN#106] Thenhe asked her who she was and what was her story, and sheanswered, "O youth, thanks be to Allah who hath cast me into thehands of the like of thee! But now rise and put me back into thebox; then fare forth upon the road and hire the first cameldriver or muleteer thou findest to carry it to thy house. When Iam there, all will be well and I will tell thee my tale andacquaint thee with my adventures, and great shall be thy gain bymeans of me." At this he rejoiced and went outside the tomb. Theday was now dazzling bright and the firmament shone with lightand the folk had begun to circulate; so he hired a man with amule and, bringing him to the tomb, lifted the chest wherein hehad put the damsel and set it on the mule. Her love now engrossedhis heart and he fared homeward with her rejoicing, for that shewas a girl worth ten thousand gold pieces and her raiment andornaments would fetch a mint of money. As soon as he arrived athis house he carried in the chest and opening it,--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.               When it was the Forty-first night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Ghanimson of Ayyub arrived with the chest at his house, he opened itand took out the young lady, who looked about her and, seeingthat the place was handsome, spread with carpets and dight withcheerful colours and other deckings; and noting the stuffs uppiled and packed bales and other else than that, knew that he wasa substantial merchant and a man of much money. There upon sheuncovered her face and looked at him, and lo! he was a fairyouth; so when she saw him she loved him and said, "O my lord,bring us something to eat." "On my head and mine eyes!" repliedhe; and, going down to the bazar, bought a roasted lamb and adish of sweetmeats and with these dry fruits and wax candles,besides wine and whatsoever was required of drinking materials,not forgetting perfumes. With all this gear he returned to thehouse; and when the damsel saw him she laughed and kissed him andclasped his neck. Then she began caressing him, which made hislove wax hotter till it got the mastery of his heart. They ateand drank and each had conceived the fondest affection; forindeed the two were one in age and one in loveliness; and whennight came on Ghanim bin Ayyub, the Distraught, the Thrall o'Love, rose and lit the wax candles and lamps till the placeblazed with light;[FN#107] after which he produced the wineservice and spread the table. Then both sat down again, he andshe, and he kept filling and giving her to drink, and she keptfilling and giving him to drink, and they played and toyed andlaughed and recited verses; whilst their joy increased and theydove in closer love each to each (glory be to the Uniter ofHearts!). They ceased not to carouse after this fashion till nearupon dawn when drowsiness overcame them and they slept where theywere, apart each from other, till the morning.[FN#108] ThenGhanim arose and going to the market, bought all they required ofmeat and vegetables and wine and what not, and brought them tothe house; whereupon both sat down to eat and ate theirsufficiency, when he set on wine. They drank and each played witheach, till their cheeks flushed red and their eyes took a darkerhue and Ghanim's soul longed to kiss the girl and to lie with herand he said, "O my lady, grant me one kiss of that dear mouth:per chance 't will quench the fire of my heart." "O Ghanim,"replied she, "wait till I am drunk and dead to the world; thensteal a kiss of me, secretly and on such wise that I may not knowthou hast kissed me." Then she rose and taking off her upperdress sat; in a thin shift of fine linen and a silken headkerchief.[FN#109] At this passion inflamed Ghanim and he said toher, "O my lady, wilt thou not vouchsafe me what I asked ofthee?" "By Allah," she replied, "that may not be thine, for thereis written upon my trouser string[FN#110] a hard word!" ThereuponGhanim's heart sank and desire grew on him as its object offereddifficulties; and he improvised these verses,"I asked the author of mine ills * To heal the wound with one     sweet kiss:No! No! she cried,[FN#111] for ever no! * But I, soft whispering,     urged yes:Quoth she, Then take it by my leave, * When smiles shall pardon     thine amiss:By force, cried I? Nay, she replied * With love and gladness eke     I wis.Now ask me not what next occurred * Seek grace of God and whist     of this!Deem what thou wilt of us, for love * By calumnies the sweeter isNor after this care I one jot * Whether my foe be known or not."Then his affection increased and love fires rose hotter in hisheart, while she refused herself to him saying, "Thou canst notpossess me." They ceased not to make love and enjoy their wineand wassail, whilst Ghanim was drowned in the sea of love andlonging; but she redoubled in coyness and cruelty till the nightbrought on the darkness and let fall on them the skirts of sleep.Thereupon Ghanim rose and lit the lamps and wax candles andrefreshed the room and removed the table; then he took her feetand kissed them and, finding them like fresh cream, pressed hisface[FN#112] on them and said to her, "O my lady, take pity onone thy love hath ta'en and thine eyes hath slain; for indeed Iwere heart whole but for thy bane!" And he wept somewhat. "O mylord, and light of my eyes," quoth she, "by Allah, I love thee invery sooth and I trust to thy truth, but I know that I may not bethine." "And what is the obstacle?" asked he; when she answered,"Tonight I will tell thee my tale, that thou mayst accept myexcuse." Then she threw herself upon him and winding her armslike a necklace about his neck, kissed him and caressed him andpromised him her favours; and they ceased not playing andlaughing till love get the firmest hold upon both their hearts.And so it continued a whole month, both passing the night on asingle carpet bed, but whenever he would enjoy her, she put himoff; whilst mutual love increased upon them and each could hardlyabstain from other. One night, as he lay by her side, and bothwere warm with wine Ghanim passed his hand over her breasts andstroked them; then he slipped it down to her waist as far as hernavel. She awoke and, sitting up, put her hand to her trousersand finding them fast tied, once more fell asleep. Presently, heagain felt her and sliding his hand down to her trouser string,began pulling at it, whereupon she awoke and sat upright. Ghanimalso sat up by her side and she asked him, "What dost thou want?""I want to lie with thee," he answered, "and that we may dealopenly and frankly with each other." Quoth she, "I must nowdeclare to thee my case, that thou mayst know my quality; thenwill my secret be disclosed to thee and my excuse become manifestto thee." Quoth he, "So be it!" Thereat she opened the skirt ofher shift and taking up her trouser string, said to him, "O mylord, read what is worked on the flat of this string:" so he tookit in hand, and saw these words broidered on it in gold, "I AMTHINE, AND THOU ART MINE, O COUSIN OF THE APOSTLE!''[FN#113] Whenhe read this, he withdrew his hand and said to her, "Tell me whothou art!" "So be it," answered she; "know that I am one of theconcubines of the Commander of the Faithful, and my name is Kutal-Kulub the Food of Hearts. I was brought up in his palace and,when I grew to woman's estate, he looked on me and, noting whatshare of beauty and loveliness the Creator had given me, loved mewith exceeding love, and assigned me a separate apartment, andgave me ten slave girls to wait on me and all these ornamentsthou seest me wearing. On a certain day he set out for one of hisprovinces, and the Lady Zubaydah came to one of the slave girlsin my service and said to her, 'I have something to require ofthee.' 'What is it, O my lady?' asked she and the Caliph's wifeanswered, 'When thy mistress Kut al-Kulub is asleep, put thispiece of Bhang into her nostrils or drop it into her drink, andthou shalt have of me as much money as will satisfy thee.' 'Withlove and gladness;' replied the girl and took the Bhang from her,being a glad woman because of the money and because aforetime shehad been one of Zubaydah's slaves. So she put the Bhang in mydrink, and when it was night drank, and the drug had no soonersettled in my stomach than I fell to the ground, my head touchingmy feet, and knew naught of my life but that I was in anotherworld. When her device succeeded, she bade put me in this chest,and secretly brought in the slaves and the doorkeepers and bribedthem; and, on the night when thou wast perched upon the datetree, she sent the blacks to do with me as thou sawest. So mydelivery was at thy hands, and thou broughtest me to this houseand hast entreated me honourably and with thy kindest. This is mystory, and I wot not what is become of the Caliph during myabsence. Know then my condition and divulge not my case." WhenGhanim heard her words and knew that she was a concubine of theCaliph, he drew back, for awe of the Caliphate beset him, and satapart from her in one of the corners of the place, blaminghimself and brooding over his affair and patiencing his heartbewildered for love of one he could not possess. Then he wept forexcess of longing, and plained him of Fortune and her injuries,and the world and its enmities (and praise be to Him who causethgenerous hearts to be troubled with love and the beloved, and whoendoweth not the minds of the mean and miserly with so much of itas eveneth a grain-weight!). So he began repeating,"The lover's heart for his beloved must meet * Sad pain, and from     her charms bear sore defeat:What is Love's taste? They asked and answered I, * Sweet is the     taste but ah! 'tis bitter sweet."Thereupon Kut al-Kulub arose and took him to her bosom and kissedhim; for the love of him was firm fixed in her heart, so that shedisclosed to him her secret and all the affection she felt; and,throwing her arms round Ghanim's neck like a collar of pearls,kissed him again and yet again. But he held off from her in aweof the Caliph. Then they talked together a long while (and indeedboth were drowned in the sea of their mutual love); and, as theday broke, Ghanim rose and donned his clothes and going to thebazar, as was his wont, took what the occasion required andreturned home. He found her weeping; but when she saw him shechecked herself and, smiling through her tears, said, "Thou hastdesolated me, O beloved of my heart. By Allah, this hour ofabsence hath been to me like a year![FN#114] I have explained tothee my condition in the excess of my eager love for thee; socome now near me, and forget the past and have thy will of me."But he interrupted her crying, "I seek refuge with Allah! Thisthing may never be. How shall the dog sit in the lion's stead?What is the lord's is unlawful to the slave!" So he with-drewfrom her, and sat down on a corner of the mat. Her passion forhim increased with his forbearance; so she seated herself by hisside and caroused and played with him, till the two were flushedwith wine, and she was mad for her own dishonour. Then she sangthese verses,"The lover's heart is like to break in twain: * Till when these     coy denials ah! till when?O thou who fliest me sans fault of mine, * Gazelles are wont at     times prove tame to men:Absence, aversion, distance and disdain, * How shall young lover     all these ills sustain?"Thereupon Ghanim wept and she wept at his weeping, and theyceased not drinking till nightfall, when he rose and spread twobeds, each in its place. "For whom is this second bed?" askedshe, and he answered her, "One is for me and the other is forthee: from this night forth we must not sleep save thus, for thatwhich is the lord's is unlawful to the thrall." "O my master!"cried she, "let us have done with this, for all things come topass by Fate and Fortune." But he refused, and the fire waslighted in her heart and, as her longing waxed fiercer, she clungto him and cried, "By Allah, we will not sleep save side byside!" "Allah forefend!" he replied and prevailed against her andlay apart till the morning, when love and longing redoubled onher and distraction and eager thirst of passion. They abode afterthis fashion three full told months, which were long and longsomeindeed, and every time she made advances to him, he would refusehimself and say, "Whatever belongeth to the master is unlawful tothe man." Now when time waxed tiresome and tedious to her andanguish and distress grew on her, she burst out from heroppressed heart with these verses,"How long, rare beauty! wilt do wrong to me? * Who was it bade     thee not belong to me?With outer charms thou weddest inner grace * Comprising every     point of piquancy:Passion thou hast infused in every heart, * From eyelids driven     sleep by deputy:Erst was (I wet) the spray made thin of leaf. * O Cassia spray!     Unlief thy sin I see:[FN#115]The hart erst hunted I: how is 't I spy * The hunter hunted (fair     my hart!) by thee?Wondrouser still I tell thee aye that I * Am trapped while never     up to trap thou be!Ne'er grant my prayer! For if I grudge thyself * To thee, I     grudge my me more jealouslyAnd cry so long as life belong to me, * Rare beauty how, how long     this wrong to me?"They abode in this state a long time, and fear kept Ghanim alooffrom her. So far concerning these two; but as regards the LadyZubaydah, when, in the Caliph's absence she had done this deed byKut al-Kulub she became perplexed, saying to herself, "What shallI tell my cousin when he comes back and asks for her? Whatpossible answer can I make to him?" Then she called an old woman,who was about her and discovered her secret to her saying, "Howshall I act seeing that Kut al-Kulub died by such untimelydeath?" "O my lady," quoth the old crone, "the time of theCaliph's return is near; so do thou send for a carpenter and bidhim make thee a figure of wood in the form of a corpse. We willdig a grave for it midmost the palace and there bury it: then dothou build an oratory over it and set therein lighted candles andlamps, and order each and every in the palace to be clad inblack.[FN#116] Furthermore command thy handmaids and eunuchs assoon as they know of the Caliph's returning from his journey, tospread straw over the vestibule floors and, when the Commander ofthe Faithful enters and asks what is the matter, let them say:--Kut al-Kulub is dead, and may Allah abundantly compensate theefor the loss of her![FN#117]; and, for the high esteem in whichshe was held of our mistress, she hath buried her in her ownpalace. When he hears this he will weep and it shall be grievousto him; then will he cause perfections of the Koran to be madefor her and he will watch by night at her tomb. Should he say tohimself, 'Verily Zubaydah, the daughter of my uncle, hathcompassed in her jealousy the death of Kut al-Kulub'; or, if lovelonging overcome him and he bid her be taken out of her tomb,fear thou not; for when they dig down and come to the image inhuman shape he will see it shrouded in costly grave clothes; and,if he wish to take off the winding sheet that he may look uponher, do thou forbid him or let some other forbid him, saying,'The sight of her nakedness is unlawful.' The fear of the worldto come will restrain him and he will believe that she is deadand will restore the figure to its place and thank thee for thydoings; and thus thou shalt escape, please Almighty Allah, fromthis slough of despond." When the Lady Zubaydah heard her words,she commended the counsel and gave her a dress of honour and alarge sum of money, ordering her to do all she had said. So theold woman set about the business forthright and bade thecarpenter make her the afore said image; and, as soon as it wasfinished, she brought it to the Lady Zubaydah, who shrouded itand buried it and built a sepulchre over it, wherein they lightedcandles and lamps, and laid down carpets about the tomb. Moreovershe put on black and she spread abroad in the Harim that Kutal-Kulub was dead. After a time the Caliph returned from hisjourney and went up to the palace, thinking only of Kut al-Kulub.He saw all the pages and eunuchs and handmaids habited in black,at which his heart fluttered with extreme fear; and, when he wentin to the Lady Zubaydah, he found her also garbed in black. So heasked the cause of this and they gave him tidings of the death ofKut al-Kulub, whereon he fell a swooning. As soon as he came tohimself, he asked for her tomb, and the Lady Zubaydah said tohim, "Know, O Prince of the Faithful, that for especial honour Ihave buried her in my own palace." Then he repaired in histravelling garb[FN#118] to the tomb that he might wail over her,and found the carpets spread and the candles and lamps lighted.When he saw this, he thanked Zubaydah for her good deed and abodeperplexed, halting between belief and unbelief till at lastsuspicion overcame him and he gave order to open the grave andtake out the body. When he saw the shroud and would have removedit to look upon her, the fear of Allah Almighty restrained him,and the old woman (taking advantage of the delay) said, "Restoreher to her place." Then he sent at once for Fakirs and Koranreaders, and caused perfections to be made over her tomb and satby the side of the grave, weeping till he fainted; and hecontinued to frequent the tomb and sit there for a whole month,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying herpermitted say.              When it was the Forty-second Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliphceased not to frequent the tomb for the period of a whole month,at the end of which time it so happened one day that he enteredthe Serraglio, after dismissing the Emirs and Wazirs, and laydown and slept awhile; and there sat at his head a slave girlfanning him, and at his feet a second rubbing and shampooingthem. Presently he awoke and, opening his eyes, shut them againand heard the handmaid at his head saying to her who was at hisfeet, "A nice business this, O Khayzaran!" and the other answeredher "Well, O Kazib al-Ban?"[FN#119] "Verily" said the first, "ourlord knoweth naught of what hath happened and sitteth waking andwatching by a tomb wherein is only a log of wood carved by thecarpenter's art." "And Kut al-Kulub," quoth the other, "what hathbefallen her?" She replied, "Know that the Lady Zubaydah sent apellet of Bhang by one of the slave women who was bribed to drugher; and when sleep overpowered her she let put her in a chest,and ordered Sawab and Kafur and Bukhayt to throw her amongst thetombs." "What dost thou say, O Kazib al-Ban;" asked Khayzaran,"is not the lady Kut al-Kulub dead?" "Nay, by Allah!" sheanswered "and long may her youth be saved from death! but I haveheard the Lady Zubaydah say that she is in the house of a youngmerchant named Ghanim bin Ayyub of Damascus, highs theDistraught, the Thrall o' Love; and she hath been with him thesefour months, whilst our lord is weeping and watching by night ata tomb wherein is no corpse." They kept on talking this sort oftalk, and the Caliph gave ear to their words; and, by the timethey had ceased speaking, he knew right well that the tomb was afeint and a fraud, and that Kut al-Kulub had been in Ghanim'shouse for four months. Whereupon he was angered with exceedinganger and rising up, he summoned the Emirs of his state; and hisWazir Ja'afar the Barmaki came also and kissed the ground betweenhis hands. The Caliph said to him in fury, "Go down, O Ja'afar,with a party of armed men and ask for the house of Ghanim son ofAyyub: fall upon it and spoil it and bring him to me with myslave girl, Kut al-Kulub, for there is no help but that I punishhim!" "To hear is to obey," said Ja'afar; and setting out withthe Governor and the guards and a world of people, repaired toGhanim's house. Now about that time the youth happened to havebrought back a pot of dressed meat and was about to put forth hishand to eat of it, he and Kut al-Kulub, when the lady, happeningto look out saw calamity surrounding the house on every side; forthe Wazir and the Governor, the night guard and the Mamelukeswith swords drawn had girt it as the white of the eye girdeth theblack. At this she knew that tidings of her had reached theCaliph, her lord; and she made sure of ruin, and her colour paledand her fair features changed and her favour faded. Then sheturned to Ghanim and said to him, "O my love! fly for thy life!""What shall I do," asked he, "and whither shall I go, seeing thatmy money and means of maintenance are all in this house?"; andshe answered, "Delay not lest thou be slain and lose life as wellas wealth." "O my loved one and light of mine eyes!" he cried,"how shall I do to get away when they have surrounded the house?"Quoth she, "Fear not;" and, stripping off his fine clothes,dressed him in ragged old garments, after which she took the potand, putting in it bits of broken bread and a saucer ofmeat,[FN#120] placed the whole in a basket and setting it uponhis head said, "Go out in this guise and fear not for me whowotteth right well what thing is in my hand for theCaliph."[FN#121] So he went out amongst them, bearing the basketwith its contents, and the Protector vouchsafed him Hisprotection and he escaped the snares and perils that beset him,by the blessing of his good conscience and pure conduct.Meanwhile Ja'afar dismounted and entering the house, saw Kutal-Kulub who had dressed and decked herself in splendid raimentsand ornaments and filled a chest with gold and jewellery andprecious stones and rarities and what else was light to bear andof value rare. When she saw Ja'afar come in, she rose and,kissing the ground before him, said, "O my lord, the Reed hathwritten of old the rede which Allah decreed!''[FN#122] "By Allah,O my lady," answered Ja'afar, "he gave me an order to seizeGhanim son of Ayyub;" and she rejoined, "O my lord, he made readyhis goods and set out therewith for Damascus and I know nothingmore of him; but I desire thee take charge of this chest anddeliver it to me in the Harim of the Prince of the Faithful.""Hearing and obedience," said Ja'afar, and bade his men bear itaway to the head quarters of the Caliphate together with Kutal-Kulub, commanding them to entreat her with honour as one inhigh esteem. They did his bidding after they had wrecked andplundered Ghanim's house. Then Ja'afar went in to the Caliph andtold him all that had happened, and he ordered Kut al-Kulub to belodged in a dark chamber and appointed an old women to serve her,feeling convinced that Ghanim had debauched her and slept withher. Then he wrote a mandate to the Emir Mohammed bin Sulaymanal-Zayni, his viceroy in Damascus, to this effect: "The instantthou shalt receive this our letter, seize upon Ghanim bin Ayyuband send him to us." When the missive came to the viceroy, hekissed it and laid it on his head; then he let proclaim in thebazars, "Whoso is desirous to plunder, away with him to the houseof Ghanim son of Ayyub."[FN#123] So they flocked thither, whenthey found that Ghanim's mother and sister had built him atomb[FN#124] in the midst of the house and sat by it weeping forhim; whereupon they seized the two without telling them the causeand, after spoiling the house, carried them before the viceroy.He questioned them concerning Ghanim and both replied, "For ayear or more we have had no news of him." So they restored themto their place. Thus far concerning them; but as regards Ghanim,when he saw his wealth spoiled and his ruin utterest he wept overhimself till his heart well nigh brake. Then he fared on atrandom till the last of the day, and hunger grew hard on him andwalking wearied him. So coming to a village he entered amosque[FN#125] where he sat down upon a mat and propped his backagainst the wall; but presently he sank to the ground in hisextremity of famine and fatigue. There he lay till dawn, hisheart fluttering for want of food; and, owing to his sweating,the lice[FN#126] coursed over his skin; his breath waxed fetidand his whole condition was changed. When the villagers came topray the dawn prayer, they found him prostrate, ailing, hungerlean, yet showing evident signs of former affluence. As soon asprayers were over, they drew near him; and, understanding that hewas starved with hunger and cold, they gave him an old robe withragged sleeves and said to him, "O stranger, whence art thou andwhat sickness is upon thee?" He opened his eyes and wept butreturned no answer; whereupon one of them, who saw that he wasstarving, brought him a saucer of honey and two barley scones. Heate a little and they sat with him till sun rise, when they wentto their work. He abode with them in this state for a month,whilst sickness and weakliness grew upon him; and they wept forhim and, pitying his condition, took counsel with one anotherupon his case and agreed to forward him to the hospital inBaghdad.[FN#127] Meanwhile behold, two beggar women, who werenone other than Ghanim's mother and sister,[FN#128] came into themosque and, when he saw them, he gave them the bread that was athis head; and they slept by his side that night but he knew themnot. Next day the villagers brought a camel and said to thecameleer, "Set this sick man on thy beast and carry him toBaghdad and put him down at the Spital door; so haply he may bemedicined and be healed and thou shalt have thy hire."[FN#129]"To hear is to comply," said the man. So they brought Ghanim, whowas asleep, out of the mosque and set him, mat and all, on thecamel; and his mother and sister came out among the crowd to gazeupon him, but they knew him not. However, after looking at himand considering him carefully they said, "Of a truth he favoursour Ghanim, poor boy!; can this sick man be he?" Presently, hewoke and finding himself bound with ropes on a camel's back, hebegan to weep and complain,[FN#130] and the village people sawhis mother and sister weeping over him, albeit they knew him not.Then they fared forth for Baghdad, but the camel-man forewentthem and, setting Ghanim down at the Spital gate, went away withhis beast. The sick man lay there till dawn and, when the folkbegan to go about the streets, they saw him and stood gazing onhim, for he had become as thin as a toothpick, till the Syndic ofthe bazar came up and drove them away from him, saying, "I willgain Paradise through this poor creature; for if they take himinto the Hospital, they will kill him in a single day."[FN#131]Then he made his young men carry him to his house, where theyspread him a new bed with a new pillow,[FN#132] and he said tohis wife, "Tend him carefully;" and she replied, "Good! on myhead be it!" Thereupon she tucked up her sleeves and warming somewater, washed his hands, feet and body; after which she clothedhim in a robe belonging to one of her slave girls and made himdrink a cup of wine and sprinkled rose wafer over him. So herevived and complained, and the thought of his beloved Kutal-Kulub made his grief redouble. Thus far concerning him; but asregards Kut al-Kulub, when the Caliph was angered against her,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say herpermitted say.               When it was the Forty-third Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theCaliph was angered against Kut al-Kulub, he ordered her to a darkchamber where she abode eighty days, at the end of which theCaliph, happening to pass on a certain day the place where shewas, heard her repeating poetry, and after she ceased recitingher verse, saying, "O my darling, O my Ghanim! how great is thygoodness and how chaste is thy nature! thou didst well by one whodid ill by thee and thou guardedst his honour who garred thinebecome dishonour, and his Harim thou didst protect who to enslavethee and shine did elect! But thou shalt surely stand, thou andthe Commander of the Faithful, before the Just Judge, and thoushalt be justified of him on the Day when the Lord (to whom behonour and glory!) shall be Kazi and the Angels of Heaven shallbe witnesses!" When the Caliph heard her com plaint, he knew thatshe had been wronged and, returning to the palace, sent Masrurthe Eunuch for her. She came before him with bowed head and eyestearful and heart sorrowful; and he said to her, "O Kut al-Kulub,I find thou accuses me of tyranny and oppression, and thouavouches that I have done ill by one who did well by me. Who isthis who hath guarded my honour while I garred his becomedishonour? Who protected my Harim and whose Harim I wrecked?" "Heis Ghanim son of Ayyub," replied she, "for he never approached mein wantonness or with lewd intent, I swear by thy munificence, OCommander of the Faithful!" Then said the Caliph, "There is noMajesty and there is no Might save in Allah! Ask what thou wiltof me, O Kut al-Kulub." "O Prince of the Faithful!", answeredshe, "I require of thee only my beloved Ghanim son of Ayyub." Hedid as she desired, whereupon she said, "O Lord of the Moslems,if I bring him to thy presence, wilt thou bestow me on him?"; andhe replied, "If he come into my presence, I will give thee to himas the gift of the generous who revoketh not his largesse." "OPrince of True Believers," quoth she, "suffer me to go and seekhim; haply Allah may unite me with him:" and quoth he, "Do evenas thou wilt." So she rejoiced and, taking with her a thousanddiners in gold, went out and visited the elders of the variousfaiths and gave alms in Ghanim's name.[FN#133] Next day shewalked to the merchants' bazar and disclosed her object to theSyndic and gave him money, saying, "Bestow this in charity to thestranger!" On the following Friday she fared to the bazar (withother thousand diners) and, entering the goldsmiths' andjewellers' market street, called the Chief and presented to him athousand diners with these words, "Bestow this in charity to thestranger!" The Chief looked at her (and he was the Syndic who hadtaken in Ghanim) and said, "O my lady, wilt thou come to my houseand look upon a youth, a stranger I have there and see how goodlyand graceful he is?" Now the stranger was Ghanim, son of Ayyub,but the Chief had no knowledge of him and thought him to be somewandering pauper, some debtor whose wealth had been taken fromhim, or some lover parted from his beloved. When she heard hiswords her heart fluttered[FN#134] and her vitals yearned, and shesaid to him, "Send with me one who shall guide me to thy house."So he sent a little lad who brought her to the house wherein wasthe head man's stranger guest and she thanked him for this. Whenshe reached the house, she went in and saluted the Syndic's wife,who rose and kissed the ground between her hands, for she knewher. Then quoth Kut al-Kulub, "Where is the sick man who is withthee?" She wept and replied, "Here is he, O my lady; by Allah, heis come of good folk and he beareth the signs of gentle breeding:you see him lying on yonder bed." So she turned and looked athim: and she saw something like him, but he was worn and wastedtill he had become lean as a toothpick, so his identity wasdoubtful to her and she could not be certain that it was he. Yetpity for him possessed her and she wept saying, "Verily thestranger is unhappy, even though he be a prince in his ownland!"; and his case was grievous to her and her heart ached forhim, yet she knew him not to be Ghanim. Then she furnished himwith wine and medicines and she sat awhile by his head, afterwhich she mounted and returned to her palace and continued tovisit every bazar in quest of her lover. Meanwhile Ghanim'smother and sister Fitnah arrived at Baghdad and met the Syndic,who carried them to Kut al-Kulub and said to her, "O Princess ofbeneficent ladies, there came to our city this day a woman andher daughter, who are fair of favour and signs of good breedingand dignity are apparent in them, though they be dressed in haircloth and have each one a wallet hanging to her neck; and theireyes are tearful and their hearts are sorrowful. So I havebrought them to thee that thou mayst give them refuge, and rescuethem from beggary, for they are not of asker folk and, if itplease Allah, we shall enter Paradise through them." "By Allah, Omy master," cried she, "thou makest me long to see them! Whereare they?", adding, "Here with them to me!" So he bade the eunuchbring them in; and, when she looked on them and saw that theywere both of distinguished beauty, she wept for them and said,"By Allah, these are people of condition and show plain signs offormer opulence." "O my lady," said the Syndic's wife, "we lovethe poor and the destitute, more especially as reward in Heavenwill recompense our love; and, as for these persons, haply theoppressor hath dealt hardly with them and hath plundered theirproperty and harried their houses." Then Ghanim's mother andsister wept with sore weeping, remembering their formerprosperity and contrasting it with their present poverty andmiserable condition; and their thoughts dwelt upon son andbrother, whilst Kut al-Kulub wept for their weeping; and theysaid, "We beseech Allah to reunite us with him whom we desire,and he is none other but my son named Ghanim bin Ayyud!" When Kutal-Kulub heard this, she knew them to be the mother and sister ofher lover and wept till a swoon came over her. When she revivedshe turned to them and said, "Have no fear and sorrow not, forthis day is the first of your prosperity and the last of youradversity!"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceasedsaying her permitted say.              When it was the Forty-fourth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kutal-Kulub had consoled them she bade the Syndic lead them to hishouse and let his wife carry them to the Hammam and dress them inhandsome clothes and take care of them and honour them with allhonour; and she gave him a sufficient sum of money. Next day, shemounted and, riding to his house, went in to his wife who rose upand kissed her hands and thanked her for her kindness. There shesaw Ghanim's mother and sister whom the Syndic's wife had takento the Hammam and clothed afresh, so that the traces of theirformer condition became manifest upon them. She sat talking withthem awhile, after which she asked the wife about the sick youthwho was in her house and she replied, "He is in the same state."Then said Kut al-Kulub, "Come, let us go and visit him." So shearose, she and the Chief's wife and Ghanim's mother and sister,and went in to the room where he lay and sat down near him.Presently Ghanim bin Ayyub, the Distraught, the Thrall o' Love,heard them mention the name of Kut al-Kulub; whereupon lifereturned to him, emaciated and withered as he was and he raisedhis head from the pillow and cried aloud, "O Kut al-Kulub!" Shelooked at him and made certain it was he and shrieked rather thansaid, "Yes, O my beloved!" "Draw near to me;" said he, and shereplied, "Surely thou art Ghanim bin Ayyub?"; and he rejoined "Iam indeed!" Hereupon a swoon came upon her; and, as soon asGhanim's mother and his sister Fitnah heard these words, bothcried out "O our joy'" and fainted clean away. When they allrecovered, Kut al-Kulub exclaimed "Praise be to Allah who hathbrought us together again and who hath reunited thee with thymother and thy sister!" And she related to him all that hadbefallen her with the Caliph and said "I have made known thetruth to the Commander of the Faithful, who believed my words andwas pleased with thee; and now he desireth to see thee," adding,"He hath given me to thee." Thereat he rejoiced with extreme joy,when she said, "Quit not this place till I come back" and, risingforthwith, betook herself to her palace. There she opened thechest which she had brought from Ghanim's house and, taking outsome of the diners, gave them to the Syndic saying, "Buy withthis money for each of them four complete suits of the fineststuffs and twenty kerchiefs, and else beside of whatsoever theyrequire;" after which she carried all three to the baths and hadthem washed and bathed and made ready for them consommes, andgalangale-water and cider against their coming out. When theyleft the Hammam, they put on the new clothes, and she abode withthem three days feeding them with chicken meats and bouillis, andmaking them drink sherbert of sugar candy. After three days theirspirits returned; and she carried them again to the baths, andwhen they came out and had changed their raiment, she led themback to the Syndic's house and left them there, whilst shereturned to the palace and craved permission to see the Caliph.When he ordered her to come in, she entered and, kissing theground between his hands, told him the whole story and how herlord, Ghanim bin Ayyub, yclept the Distraught, the Thrall o'Love, and his mother and sister were now in Baghdad. When theCaliph heard this, he turned to the eunuchs and said, "Here withGhanim to me." So Ja'afar went to fetch him; but Kut al-Kulubforewent him and told Ghanim, "The Caliph hath sent to fetch theebefore him," and charged him to show readiness of tongue andfirmness of heart and sweetness of speech. Then she robed him ina sumptuous dress and gave him diners in plenty, saying, "Belavish of largesse to the Caliph's household as thou goest in tohim." Presently Ja'afar, mounted on his Nubian mule, came tofetch him; and Ghanim advanced to welcome the Wazir and, wishinghim long life, kissed the ground before him. Now the star of hisgood fortune had risen and shone brightly; and Ja'afar took him;and they ceased not faring together, he and the Minister, tillthey went in to the Commander of the Faithful. When he stood inthe presence, he looked at the Wazirs and Emirs and Chamberlains,and Viceroys and Grandees and Captains, and then at the Caliph.Hereupon he sweetened his speech and his eloquence and, bowinghis head to the ground, broke out in these extempore couplets,"May that Monarch's life span a mighty span, * Whose lavish of     largesse all Empyrean! lieges scan:None other but he shall be Kaysar highs, * Lord of lordly hall     and of haught Divan:Kings lay their gems on his threshold-dust * As they bow and     salam to the mighty man;And his glances foil them and all recoil, * Bowing beards aground     and with faces wan:Yet they gain the profit of royal grace, * The rank and station     of highEarth's plain is scant for thy world of men, * Camp there in Kay     wan's[FN#135] Empyrean!May the King of Kings ever hold thee dear; * Be counsel shine and     right steadfast planTill thy justice spread o'er the wide spread earth * And the near     and the far be of equal worth."When he ended his improvisation the Caliph was pleased by it andmarvelled at the eloquence of his tongue and the sweetness of hisspeech,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased tosay her permitted say.               When it was the Forty-fifth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph,after marvelling at his eloquence of tongue and sweetness ofspeech, said to him, "Draw near to me." So he drew near and quoththe King, "Tell me thy tale and declare to me thy case." SoGhanim sat down and related to him what had befallen him inBaghdad, of his sleeping in the tomb and of his opening the chestafter the three slaves had departed, and informed him, in short,of everything that had happened to him from commencement toconclusion none of which we will repeat for interest fails intwice told tales. The Caliph was convinced that he was a trueman; so he invested him with a dress of honour, and placed himnear himself in token of favour, and said to him, "Acquit me ofthe responsibility I have incurred.''[FN#136] And Ghanim so did,saying, "O our lord the Sultan, of a truth thy slave and allthings his two hands own are his master's." The Caliph waspleased at this and gave orders to set apart a palace for him andassigned to him pay and allowances, rations and donations, whichamounted to something immense. So he removed thither with sisterand mother; after which the Caliph, hearing that his sisterFitnah was in beauty a very "fitnah,"[FN#137] a mere seduction,demanded her in marriage of Ghanim who replied, "She is thyhandmaid as I am thy slave." The Caliph thanked him and gave himan hundred thousand diners, then summoned the witnesses and theKazi, and on one and the same day they wrote out the twocontracts of marriage between the Caliph and Fitnah and betweenGhanim bin Ayyub and Kut al-Kulub; and the two marriages wereconsummated on one and the same night. When it was morning, theCaliph gave orders to record the history of what had befallenGhanim from first to last and to deposit it in the royal munimentrooms, that those who came after him might read it and marvel atthe dealings of Destiny and put their trust in Him who createdthe night and the day. Yet, O auspicious King, this story towhich thou hast deigned give ear is on no wise more wondrous thanthe     Tale Of King Omar Bin Al-Nu'uman And His Sons Sharrkan                       And Zau Al-Makan, And What Befel Them of Things Seld-Seen and Peregrine.[FN#138]The King asked her, "And what was their story?" and she answered:It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was in the Cityof Safety, Baghdad, before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik binMarwan,[FN#139] a King, Omar bin al-Nu'uman highs, who was of themighty giants and had subjected the Chosroes of Persia and theKaysars of Eastern Rome; for none could warm himself at hisfire;[FN#140] nor could any avail to meet him in the field offoray and fray; and, when he was angered, there came forth fromhis nostrils sparks of flame.  He had made himself King over allquarters, and Allah had subjected to him all His creatures; hisword went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried thefarthest lands.  East and West had come under his command withwhatsoever regions lay interspersed between them, Hind and Sindand Sin,[FN#141] the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz, the rich mountains ofAl-Yaman and the archipelagos of India and China.  Moreover, hereigned supreme over the north country and Diyar Bakr, orMesopotamia, and over Sudan, the Eastern Negro land and theIslands of the Ocean, and all the far famed rivers of the earth,Sayhun and Jayhun,[FN#142] Nile and Euphrates.  He sent envoysand ambassadors to capitals the most remote, to provide him withtrue report; and they would bring back tidings of justice andpeace, with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers inthe pulpits for King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; for he was, O Ruler ofthe Age, a right noble King; and there came to him presents ofrarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing. This mighty monarch had a son yclept Sharrkan,[FN#143] who waslikest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of theprodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing hiscontemporaries to bane and ban.  For this his father loved himwith love so great none could be greater, and made him heir tothe kingdom after himself.  This Prince grew up till he reachedman's estate and was twenty years old, and Allah subjected Hisservants to him, by reason of his great might and prowess inbattle.  Now his father, King Omar, had four wives legallymarried, but Allah had vouchsafed him no son by them, saveSharrkan, whom he had begotten upon one of them, and the restwere barren.  Moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines,after the number of days in the Coptic year, who were of allnations; and he had furnished for each and every a privatechamber within his own palace.  For he had built twelvepavilions, after the number of the months, each containing thirtyprivate chambers, which thus numbered three hundred and threescore, wherein he lodged his handmaids: and he appointedaccording to law for each one her night, when he lay with her andcame not again to her for a full year;[FN#144] and on this wisehe abode for a length of time.  Meanwhile his son Sharrkan wasmaking himself renowned in all quarters of the world and hisfather was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier; sothat he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and tookby storm castles and cities.  Presently, by decree of theDecreer, a handmaid among the handmaids of Omar bin Nu'umanbecame pregnant; and, her pregnancy being announced to the Harim,the King was informed thereof; whereupon he rejoiced withexceeding joy and said, "Haply it will be a son, and so all myoffspring will be males!" Then he documented the date of herconception and entreated her with all manner of kindness.  Butwhen the tidings came to Sharrkan, he was troubled and the matterseemed to him a sore one and a grievous; and he said, "Verily onecometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty:" so quoth he tohimself, "If this concubine bear a male child I will kill it:"but he kept that intention hidden in his heart.  Such was thecase with Sharrkan; but what happened in the matter of the damselwas as follows.  She was a Roumiyah, a Greek girl, by nameSofiyah or Sophia,[FN#145] whom the King of Roum and Lord ofCaesarea had sent to King Omar as a present, together with greatstore of gifts and of rarities: she was the fairest of favour andloveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of herhonour; and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as herpresence was fascinating.  Now she had served the King on thenight of his sleeping with her, saying to him, "O King!  I desireof the God of the Heavens that he bless thee this night with amale child by me, so I may bring him up with the best of rearing,and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence,good manners and prudent bearing"[FN#146]--a speech which muchpleased the King.  During her pregnancy she was instant inprayer, fervently supplicating the Lord to bless her with agoodly male child and make his birth easy to her; and Allah heardher petition so that after her months were accomplished she satsafely upon the birth stool.[FN#147]  Now the King had deputed aeunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth weremale or female; and in like way his son Sharrkan had sent one tobring him tidings of the same.  In due time Sophia was deliveredof a child, which the midwives examined and found to be a girlwith a face sheenier than the moon.  So they announced this toall present in the room, whereupon the King's messenger carriedthe news to him; and Sharrkan's eunuch did the like with hismaster who rejoiced with exceeding joy.  But, after the two haddeparted, quoth Sophia to the midwives, "Wait with me awhile, forI feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb." Then shecried out and the pains of child bed again took her; and Allahmade it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child.  Thewise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon,with forehead flower white, and cheek ruddy bright with rosylight; whereupon the mother rejoiced, as did the eunuchs andattendants and all the company; and Sophia was delivered of theafter birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill ofjoy.[FN#148]  The rest of the concubines heard it and envied herlot; and the tidings reached Omar son of Al- Nu'uman, who wasglad and rejoiced at the excellent news.  Then he rose and wentto her and kissed her head, after which he looked at the boy;and, bending over him, kissed him, whilst the damsels struck thetabors and played on instruments of music; and the King gaveorder that the boy should be named Zau al-Makan and his sisterNuzhat al-Zaman.[FN#149]  They answered "Hearing and obedience,"and did his bidding; so he appointed wet nurses and dry nursesand eunuchs and attendants to serve them; and assigned themrations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside,beyond the power of tongue to rehearse.  Moreover the people ofBaghdad, hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue,decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings withdrum and tom tom; and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitariescame to the palace and wished King Omar bin al-Nu'uman joy of hisson, Zau al-Makan, and of his daughter Nuzhat al-Zaman, whereforehe thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour andfurther favoured them with gifts, and dealt largesse to all,gentle and simple, who were present.  After this fashion he didfor four days full told, and he lavished upon Sophia raiment andornaments and great store of wealth; and, every few days he wouldsend a messenger to ask after her and the new-borns.  And whenfour years had gone by, he provided her with the wherewithal torear the two children carefully and educate them with the best ofinstructions.  All this while his son Sharrkan knew not that amale child had been born to his father, Omar son of Al-Nu'uman,having news only that he had been blessed with the birth ofNuzhat al-Zaman; and they hid the intelligence from him, untildays and years had sped by, whilst he was busied in battling withthe brave and fighting single handed against the knights.  Oneday, as King Omar was sitting in his palace, his Chamberlainscame in to him and, kissing the ground before him, said, "O Kingthere be come Ambassadors from the King of Roum, Lord ofConstantinople the Great, and they desire admission to thee andsubmission to thy decree: if the King commend us to introducethem we will so do; and, if not, there is no disputing hisbehest." He bade them enter and, when they came in, he turned tothem and, courteously receiving them, asked them of their case,and what was the cause of their coming.  They kissed the groundbefore him and said, "O King glorious and strong!  O lord of thearm that is long!  know that he who despatched us to thee is KingAfridun,[FN#150] Lord of Ionia land[FN#151] and of the Nazarenearmies, the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery ofConstantinople, to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce warand fell with a tyrant and a rebel, the Prince of Casarea; andthe cause of this war is as follows.  One of the Kings of theArabs in past time, during certain of his conquests, chanced upona hoard of the time of Alexander,[FN#152] whence he removedwealth past compute; and, amongst other things, three roundjewels, big as ostrich eggs, from a mine of pure white gems whoselike was never seen by man.  Upon each were graven characts inIonian characters, and they have many virtues and properties,amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round theneck of a new-born child, no evil shall befal him and he shallneither wail, nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remainwithout fail.[FN#153] When the Arab King laid hands upon them andlearned their secrets, he sent to King Afridun presents ofcertain rarities and amongst them the three jewels aforementioned; and he equipped for the mission two ships, one bearingthe treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any whomight offer hindrance on the high seas, albeit well assured thatnone would dare waylay his vessels, for that he was King of theArabs, and more by token that their course lay over waterssubject to the King of Constantinople and they were bound to hisport; nor were there on the shores of that sea any save thesubjects of the Great King, Afridun.  The two ships set out andvoyaged till they drew near our city, when there sallied out onthem certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troopsfrom the Prince of Caesarea, who took all the treasures andrarities in the ships, together with the three jewels, and slewthe crews.  When our King heard of this, he sent an army againstthem, but they routed it; then he marched a second and a strongerbut they put this also to flight,--whereupon the King waxed wrothand swore that he would not go forth[FN#154] against them save inhis own person at the head of his whole army; nor would he turnback from them till he had left Caesarea, of Armenia[FN#155] inruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which herPrince held sway.  So he sent us to the Lord of the age and thetime, Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman, King of Baghdad and ofKhorasan, desiring that he aid us with an army, so may honour andglory accrue to him; and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat ofvarious kinds of presents, and of the King's grace he beggeththeir acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance." Then theAmbassadors kissed the ground before him,--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.               When it was the Forty-sixth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, after theAmbassadors and retinue from the Constantinopolitan King hadkissed the ground before Omar and had delivered their embassage,they brought out the presents, which were fifty damsels of thechoicest from Graecia-land, and fifty Mamelukes in tunics ofbrocade, belted with girdles of gold and silver, each wearing inhis ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing athousand ducats every one.  The girls were adorned in likefashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money.  Whenthe King saw them, he rejoiced in them and accepted them; then hebade the Ambassadors be honourably entreated and, summoning hisWazirs, took counsel with them of what he should do.  Herewithrose up among them a Wazir, an ancient man, Dandan[FN#156] highs,who kissed the ground before Omar and said, "O King, there isnothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiantand victorious, and set over it thy son Sharrkan with us as hislieutenants; and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts;first, because the King of Roum hath invoked thine assistance andhath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted; and, secondly,because while no enemy dareth attack our country, thine army maygo forth safely and, should it succour the King of Graecia-landand defeat his foe, the glory will be thine.  Moreover, the newsof it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries andespecially, when the tidings shall reach the Islands of the Oceanand the Kings of Mauritania shall hear it, they will send theeofferings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money." The Kingpleased by the Wazir's words and approving his rede, gave him adress of honour and said to him, "Of the like of thee shouldKings ask counsel, and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conductthe van of our army and our son Sharrkan command the mainbattle." Then he sent for his son who came and kissed groundbefore him and sat down; and he expounded to him the matter,telling him what the Ambassadors and the Wazir Dandan had said,and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for thecampaign, enjoining him not to gainsay Dandan in aught he shoulddo.  Moreover, he ordered him to pick out of his army tenthousand horsemen, armed cap-a-pie and inured to onset and stressof war.  Accordingly, Sharrkan arose on the instant, and choseout a myriad of horsemen, after which he entered his palace andmustered his host and distributed largesse to them, saying, "Yehave delay of three days." They kissed the earth before him inobedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions,and provide provisions for the occasion; whilst Sharrkan repairedto the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required ofarms and armour, and thence to the stable where he chose horsesof choice blood and others.  When the appointed three days wereended, the army drew out to the suburbs of Baghdad city;[FN#157]and King Omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed theground before him and received from the King seven parcels ofmoney.[FN#158] Then he turned to Danden and commended to his carethe army of his son; and the Wazir kissed the ground before himand answered, "I hear and I obey;" and lastly he charged Sharrkanthat he should consult the Wazir on all occasions, which hepromised to do.  After this, the King returned to his city andSharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battlearray.  So they mustered them and their number was ten thousandhorsemen, besides footmen and camp followers.  Then they loadedtheir baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and thetrumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled,whilst Sharrkan mounted horse, with the Wazir Dandan by his side,and the colours fluttering over their heads.  So the host faredforth and stinted not faring, with the ambassadors precedingthem, till day departed and night drew nigh, when they alightedand encamped for the night.  And as soon as Allah caused the morntomorrow, they mounted and tried on, guided by the Ambassadors,for a space of twenty days; and by the night of the twenty firstthey came to a fine and spacious Wady well grown with trees andshrubbery.  Here Sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded athree days' halt, so they dismounted and pitched their tents,spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of theextensive valley, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the Ambassadors ofKing Afridun pitched in the sole of the Wady.[FN#159]  As forSharrkan, he tarried behind them for awhile till all haddismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides; hethen slacked the reins of his steed, being minded to explore theWady and to mount guard in his own person, because of hisfather's charge and owing to the fact that they were on thefrontier of Graecia land and in the enemy's country.  So he rodeout alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard tocamp near the Wazir Dandan, and he fared on along the side of thevalley till a fourth part of the night was passed, when he felttired and drowsiness overcame him, so that he could no longerurge horse with heel.  Now he was accustomed to take rest onhorseback; so when slumber overpowered him, he slept and thesteed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spentand entered one of the thickets[FN#160] which was dense withgrowth; but Sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled overwooded ground.  Then he started from sleep and found himselfamong the trees, and the moon arose and shone brightly over thetwo horizons, Eastern and Western.  He was startled when he foundhimself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yetshamed its sayer, "There is no Majesty and there is no Might savein Allah, the Glorious, the Great!" But as he rode on, in fear ofwild beasts, behold, the moon spread her glad light over a meadowas if it were of the meads of Paradise; and he heard pleasantvoices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating thesenses of men.  So King Sharrkan alighted and, tying his steed toone of the trees, went over a little way till he came upon astream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying, "Now bythe crush of the Messiah, this is not well of you! but whoseutters a word, I will throw her and truss her up with her owngirdle[FN#161]!"  He kept walking in the direction of the soundand when he reached the further side he looked and behold, astream was gushing and flowing, and antelopes at large werefrisking and roving, and wild cattle amid the pasture moving, andbirds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues, andthat place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs,even as a poet described it in these couplets,"Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom, * When lucid waters     course through plain and wood:No work but His th' All great, th' All glorious, * Giver of all     gifts, Giver of all good!"And as Sharrkan considered the place, he saw in it a ChristianMonastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in aircatching the light of the moon.[FN#162] Through the midst of theconvent passed a stream, the water flowing amongst its gardens;and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard, whilebefore her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing varioussorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled thebeholder, high bosomed virgins, as saith of them the poet inthese couplets,"The mead is bright with what is on't * Of merry maidens     debonnair:Double its beauty and its grace * Those trooping damsels slender-    fair:Virgins of graceful swimming gait * Ready with eye and lip to     ensnare;And like the tendril'd vine they loose * The rich profusion of     their hair:Shooting their shafts and arrows from * Beautiful eyes beyond     compare;Overpowering and transpiercing * Every froward adversaire."Sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a ladylike the moon at fullest, with ringleted hair and forehead sheenywhite, and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright, and templelocks like the scorpion's tail; and she was perfect in essenceand attributes, as the poet said of her in these couplets,"She beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance, * And her     straight slender stature enshamed the lance:She burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red, * Where all manner of     beauties have habitance:And the locks on her forehead were lowering as night * Whence     issues a dawn tide of happiest chance."Then Sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids, "Come ye on, that Imay wrestle with you and gravel you, ere the moon set and thedawn break!" So each came up to her in turn and she grounded themforthright, and pinioned them with their girdles, and ceased notwrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all. Then there turned to her an old woman who was before her, and thebeldam said as in wrath, "O strumpet, cost thou glory ingrounding these girls?  Behold I am an old woman, yet have Ithrown them forty times!  So what hast thou to boast of?  But ifthou have the strength to wrestle with me, stand up that I maygrip thee and set thy head between thy heels!" The young ladysmiled at her words, but she was filled with inward wrath, andshe jumped up and asked, "O my lady Zat al-Dawahi,[FN#163] by thetruth of the Messiah, wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed, ordost thou jest with me?"; and she answered, "Yea,"--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Forty-seventh Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theyoung lady asked Zat al-Dawahi, "By the truth of the Messiah,wilt wrestle with me or dost jest?", and she answered, "Yea, Iwill wrestle with thee in very deed" (Sharrkan looking on thewhile), the damsel cried, "Rise up for the fall an thou havespunk so to do." When the old woman heard this, she raged withexceeding rage, and her body hair stood on end like the bristlesof a fretful hedgehog.[FN#164] Then she sprang to her feet,whilst the damsel stood up to her, and said, "Now by the truth ofthe Messiah, I will not wrestle with thee unless I be naked,Mistress whore!"[FN#165] So she loosed her petticoat trousersand, putting her hand under her clothes, tore them off her body;then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape, girt it roundher middle and became as she were a scald head If ritah or aspotted snake.  With this she inclined towards the damsel andsaid, "Do thou as I have done." All this time, Sharrkan wasgazing at the twain, and laughing at the beldam's loathlysemblance.  So the damsel leisurely rose and, taking a sash ofYamani stuff, passed it twice round her waist, then she tucked upher trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying amound of crystal, smooth and rounded, and a stomach which exhaledmusk from its dimples, as it were a bed of Nu'uman's anemones;and breasts like double pomegranates.  Then the old woman leanttowards her, and the two laid hold either of each, while Sharrkanraised his head Heavenwards and prayed Allah that the belle mightbeat the beldam.  Presently the young woman get beneath the oldwoman; and, gripping her waist cloth with the left and circlingher neck with the right hand, hoisted her off the ground withboth; whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and, in sodoing fell on her back arsiversy, with her legs high in air andher hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine;furthermore she let fly two great farts[FN#166] one of which blewup the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to thegate of Heaven.  Sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon theground.  Then he arose and, baring his brand looked right andleft, but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back,and said to himself, "He lied not who named thee Lady ofCalamities!  Verily thou knewest her prowess by her performanceupon the others." So he drew near them to hear what should passbetween them.  Then the young lady went up to the old one and,throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness, helped her todon her clothes and made excuses saying, "O my lady Zat al-Dawahi, I intended only to throw thee and not all this, but thoutriedst to twist out of my hands; so laud to Allah for safety!"She returned her no answer, but rose in her shame and walked awaytill out of sight, leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned,with the fair damsel standing amongst them.  Quoth Sharrkan tohimself, "Every luck hath its cause.  Sleep did not fall upon menor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune; fordoubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty tome." So he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled[FN#167]him on, when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in hishand he still hent his brand bare of sheath, which he brandishedshouting the while his war cry, "Allah is All mighty[FN#168]!"When the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and, taking firmstand on the bank of the stream, whose breadth was six ells, thenormal cubits, made one bound and landed clear on the fartherside,[FN#169] where she turned and cried out with a loud voice,"Who art thou, O thou fellow, that breakest in upon our privacyand pastime, and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host? Whence camest thou and whither art thou going?  Speak sooth, fortruth will stand thee in good stead, and lie not, for lies comeof villein breed Doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thyway, that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were thegreatest of mercies; for thou art now in an open plain and, didwe shout but a single shout, would come to our rescue fourthousand knights.[FN#170] So tell me what thou wantest; and ifthou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road, we will doso." When Sharrkan heard her words he replied, "I am a strangerof the Moslems, who fared forth this night single handed, seekingfor spoil; nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty thanthese ten maidens; so I shall seize them and rejoin my comradeswith them." Quoth she, "I would have thee know that as for thebooty thou hast not come at it; and, as for the handmaids, byAllah, they shall never be thy spoil.  Have I not told thee thatto lie is villein vile?" Quoth he, "The wise man is he who takethwarning by others." Thereupon quoth she, "By the truth of theMessiah, did I not fear that thy death would be on my hands, Iwould shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steedsand with men of might, but I take pity upon the stranger.  So, ifthou seek booty, I require of thee that thou alight from thysteed and swear to me, by thy faith, that thou wilt not advanceagainst me aught like arms in hand, and we will wrestle, I andthou.  If thou throw me, set me on thy steed and take all of usto thy booty; but if I throw thee, thou shalt become under mycommand.  Swear this to me, for I fear thy treachery: indeed ithath become a common saw, 'Where Perfidy is innate there Trust isa weakly mate.' Now an thou wilt swear I will return and drawnear to thee and tackle thee." Answered Sharrkan (and indeed helusted to seize her and said in his soul, "Truly she knoweth notthat I am a champion of champions"); "Swear me by what oath thouwilt and by what thou deemest most binding, and I will notapproach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation andsayest, 'Draw near that I wrestle with thee.' If thou throw me, Ihave money where withal to ransom myself; and if I throw thee,'twill be booty and booty enough for me!" Rejoined the damsel, "Iam content herewith!" and Sharrkan was astounded at her words andsaid, "And by the truth of the Apostle (whom Allah bless andkeep!) I too am content on the other part!" Then said she, "Swearto me by Him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule mankind aright, that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence saveby way of wrestling; else mayst thou die without the pale of Al-Islam." Sharrkan replied, "By Allah!  were a Kazi to swear me,even though he were a Kazi of the Kazis,[FN#171] he would notimpose upon me such an oath as this!" Then he sware to her by allshe named and tied his steed to a tree; but he was drowned in thesea of thought, saying in himself, "Praise be to Him whofashioned her from dirty water!"[FN#172] Then he girt himself andmade ready for wrestling, and said to her, "Cross the stream tome;" but she replied, "It is not for me to come over to thee: ifthou wilt, pass thou over here to me." "I cannot do that," quothhe, and quoth she, "O boy, I will come across to thee." So shetucked up her skirts and, leaping, landed on the other side ofthe stream by his side; whereupon he drew near to her and benthim forwards and clapped palms.[FN#173] But he was confounded byher beauty and loveliness; for he saw a shape which the Hand ofPower had tanned with the dye leaves of the Jann, which had beenfostered by the Hand of Beneficence and fanned by the Zephyrs offair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted. Then she called out to him, "O Moslem, come on and let us wrestleere the break of morning," and tucked up her sleeves from aforearm like fresh curd, which illumined the whole place with itswhiteness; and Sharrkan was dazzled by it.  Then he bent forwardsand clapped his palms by way of challenge, she doing the like,and caught hold of her, and the two grappled and gripped andinterlocked hands and arms.  Presently he shifted his hands toher slender waist, when his finger tips sank into the soft foldsof her middle, breeding languishment, and he fell a tremblinglike the Persian reed in the roaring gale.  So she lifted him upand, throwing him to the ground, sat upon his breast with hipsand hinder cheeks like mounds of sand, for his soul had lostmastery over his senses.  Then she asked him, "O Moslem! theslaying of Nazarenes is lawful to you folk; what then hast thouto say about being slain thyself?"; and he answered, "O my lady,thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful; forour prophet Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!) prohibitedthe slaying of women and children, old men and monks!" "As it wasthus revealed to your Prophet," she replied, "it behoveth us torender the equivalent of his mercy; so rise.  I give thee thylife, for generosity is never lost upon the generous." Then shegot off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust fromhis head against the owners of the curved rib, even women; andshe said to him, "Be not ashamed; but verily one who entereth theland of Roum in quest of booty, and cometh to assist Kingsagainst Kings, how happeneth it that he hath not strength enoughto defend himself from one made out of the curved rib?" "'Twasnot for lack of strength in me," he answered; "nor didst thouthrow me by thy force; it was thy loveliness overthrew me; so ifthou wilt grant me another bout, it will be of thy courtesy." Shelaughed and said, "I grant thee thy request: but these handmaidshave long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary, andit were only right I should loose them, for haply this nextwrestling bout will be long." Then she went to the slave girlsand, unbinding them, said to them in the tongue of Greece, "Getye to some safe place, till I foil this Moslem's lust and longingfor you." So they went away, whilst Sharrkan kept gazing at themand they kept turning to look at the two.  Then each approachedthe adversary and he set his breast against hers, but when hefelt waist touch waist, his strength failed him; and she, waxingware of this, lifted him with her hands swiftlier than theblinding leven-flash, and threw him to the ground.  He fell onhis back,[FN#174] and then she said to him, "Rise: I give theethy life a second time.  I spared thee in the first count becauseof thy Prophet, for that he made unlawful the slaying of women;and I do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and thegreenness of thine years and thy strangerhood; but I charge thee,if there be in the Moslem army sent by Omar bin al-Nu'uman tosuccour the King of Constantinople, a stronger than thou, sendhim hither and tell him of me: for in wrestling there are shiftsand trips, catches and holds, such as the feint or falsing andthe snap or first grip, the hug, the feet-catch, the thighLite,[FN#175] the jostle and the leg-lock." "By Allah, O mylady," quoth Sharrkan (and indeed he was highly incensed againsther), "had I been Master al-Safdi, Master Mohammed Kimal or Ibnal-Saddi,[FN#176] as they were in their prime, I had kept no noteof these shifts thou mentionest; for O my mistress, by Allah,thou hast not grassed me by thy strength, but by theblandishments of thy back parts; for we men of Mesopotamia solove a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me norforesight.  But now, an thou wish, thou shalt try a third fallwith me while my wits are about me, and this last match isallowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best ofthree: moreover I have regained my presence of mind." When sheheard his words she said to him, "Hast thou not had a belly fullof this wrestling, O vanquished one?  However come on, an thouwilt; but know that this must be the last round." Then she bentforward and challenged him and Sharrkan did likewise, setting toit in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw: sothe two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength suchas she had not observed before and said to him, "O Moslem, thouart now on thy mettle." "Yes," he replied, "thou knowest thatthere remaineth to me but this one round, after which each of uswill wend a different way." She laughed and he laughedtoo;[FN#177] then she overreached at his thigh and caught firmhold of it unawares, which made him greet the ground and fallfull on his back.  She laughed at him and said, "Art thou aneater of bran?  Thou are like a Badawi's bonnet which falleth offwith every touch or else the Father of Winds[FN#178] thatdroppeth before a puff of air.  Fie upon thee, O thou poorthing!" adding, "Get thee back to the Moslem army and send usother than thyself, for thou fairest of thews; and proclaim forus, among the Arabs and Persians, the Turks andDaylamites,[FN#179] whoso hath might in him, let him come to us."Then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the streamand said to Sharrkan, laughing, "Parting with thee is rightgrievous to me, O my lord; but get thee to thy mates before dawn,lest the Knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lancepoints.  Thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman, sohow couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might andKnights?" Sharrkan was confounded and called to her (as sheturned from him making towards the convent), "O my lady, wiltthou go away and leave the miserable stranger, the broken heartedslave of love?" So she turned to him laughing and said, "What isthy want?  I will grant thee thy prayer." "Have I set foot in thycountry and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy," replied he,"and shall I return without eating of thy victual and tasting thyhospitality; I who have become one of thy servitors!" "None baulkkindliness save the base," she rejoined, "honour us in Allah'sname, on my head and eyes be it!  Mount thy steed and ride alongthe brink of the stream over against me, for now thou art myguest." At this Sharrkan was glad and, hastening back to hishorse, mounted and walked him abreast of her, and she kept faringon till they came to a drawbridge[FN#180] built of beams of thewhite poplar, hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast withhooks and padlocks.  When Sharrkan looked, he saw awaiting herupon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in thewrestling bouts; and, as she came up to them, she said to one inthe Greek tongue, "Arise and take the reins of his horse andconduct him across into the convent." So she went up to Sharrkanand led him over, much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw,and saying to himself, "O would that the Wazir Dandan were herewith me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours."Then he turned to the young lady and said to her, "O marvel ofloveliness, now I have two claims upon thee; first the claim ofgood fellowship, and secondly for that thou hast carried me tothy home and offered me thy hospitality.  I am now under thycommandance and thy guidance; so do me one last favour byaccompanying me to the lands of Al-Islam; where thou shalt lookupon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who I am."When she heard this she was angered and said to him, "By thetruth of the Messiah, thou hast proved thyself with me a man ofkeen wit; but now I see what mischief there is in thy heart, andhow thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thytraitorous intent.  How should I do as thou sayest, when I wotthat if I came to that King of yours, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, Ishould never get free from him?  For truly he hath not the likeof me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls, Lordof Baghdad and of Khorasan though he be, who hath built forhimself twelve pavilions, in number as the months of the year,and in each a concubine after the number of the days; and if Icome to him he would not prove shy of me, for your folk believe Iam lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ, 'Or thosewomen whom your right hand shall possess as slaves.'[FN#181] Sohow canst thou speak thus to me?  As for thy saying, 'Thou shaltlook upon the braves of the Moslems,' by the truth of theMessiah, thou sayest that which is not true, for I saw your armywhen it reached our land, these two days ago; and I did not seethat your ordinance was the ordinance of Kings, but I beheld onlya rabble of tribesmen gathered together.  And as to thy words,'Thou shalt know who I am,' I did not do thee kindness because ofthy dignity but out of pride in myself; and the like of theeshould not talk thus to the like of me, even wert thou Sharrkan,Omar bin al- Nu'uman's son, the prowess name in these days!""Knowest thou Sharrkan?" asked he; and she answered Yes! and Iknow of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen;also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gainprevalence for the King of Constantinople." "O my lady," saidSharrkan, "I adjure thee by thy religion, tell me the cause ofall this, that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth, and withwhom the fault lies." "Now by the virtue of thy faith," shereplied, "did I not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroadthat I am of the daughters of Roum, I would adventure myself andsally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen andslay their leader, the Wazir Dandan and vanquish their championSharrkan.[FN#182] Nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby,for I have read books and studied the rules of good breeding inthe language of the Arabs.  But I have no need to vaunt my ownprowess to thee, more by token as thou hast proved in thy properperson my skill and strength in wrestling; and thou hast learntmy superiority over other women.  Nor, indeed, had Sharrkanhimself been here this night and it were said to him, 'Clear thisstream,' could he have done it; and I only long and lust that theMessiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent, thatI might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him fromhis saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say herpermitted say.              When it was the Forty-eighth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theNazarene damsel said to Sharrkan (and he listening impatientlyenow), "Verily if Sharrkan fell into my hands, I would go forthto him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seatand make him my captive and lay him in bilboes," pride andpassion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and hedesired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load; buther loveliness restrained him and he began repeating,"An faulty of one fault the Beauty prove, * Her charms a thousand     advocates shall move."So she went up and Sharrkan after her; and, when he saw themaiden's back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other,like rollers in the rolling sea, he extemporised these couplets:--"For her sins is a pleader that brow, * And all hearts its fair     pleading must bow:When I saw it I cried, "To night * The moon at its fullest doth     show;Tho' Balkis' own Ifrit[FN#183] try a bout, * Spite his force she     would deal him a throw."The two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose amarble archway.  This she opened and ushered Sharrkan into a longvestibule, vaulted with ten connected arches, from each of whichhung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire.  Thehandmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles ofgoodly perfume, and wearing on their heads golden fillets crustedwith all manner bezel gems,[FN#184] and went on before her(Sharrkan still following), till they reached the inner convent. There the Moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around, oneopposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered ingold.  The monastery floor was paved with every kind of varicoloured marbles and mosaic work, and in the midst stood a basinthat held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold, whence thewater ran like molten silver; whilst at the upper end stood athrone spread with silks fit only for Kings.  Then said thedamsel, "Ascend, O my lord, this throne." So he went up to it andsat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time. Sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him,"She hath gone to her dormitory; but we will serve thee even asshe ordered." So they set before him viands of rare varieties,and he ate his sufficiency, when they brought him a basin of goldand an ewer of silver, and he washed his hands.  Then histhoughts reverted to his army, knowing not what had befallen itin his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten hisfather's injunctions: so he was troubled about his case,repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the dayappeared; when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in seaof sadness and repeated,"I am not lost to prudence, but indeed * Here I'm bewildered,     what shall be my rede?Would any aid me in mine ails of love, * By my own might and     sleight would I be free'd:But ah! my heart is lost and passion-shent: * To none save Allah     can I trust my need!"When he ended his verse behold, there came up to him a rare showand a fair, more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassingthe young lady, who shone in their midst as the full moon amongthe constellations guarding and girding her.  She was clad inbrocades befitting Kings; her breasts were like twinpomegranates, a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightlyclasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips; and herhinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal[FN#185] supportinga silvern shaft.  When Sharrkan looked at her his wits went nighto fly away from him with delight; and he forgot army and Waziras he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work ofpearls set off by divers sorts of gems.  Handmaids on her rightand handmaids on her left bore her train, as she paced withdainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead.  He sprangto his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness, and cried aloud,"Beware and beware of that zone rarely fair!" and broke out intothese couplets,"With heavy back parts, high breasts delicate, * And lissome form     that sways with swimming gaitShe deftly hides love longing in her breast; * But I may never     hide its ban and bateWhile hosts of followers her steps precede,[FN#186] * Like pearls     now necklaced and now separate."She gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till shewas assured of him, when she came up to him and said, "In verysooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee, O Sharrkan! How sped thy night, O hero, after we went away and left thee?";adding, "Verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful, especiallyin great Kings! and thou art Crown Prince Sharrkan, son and heirof King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; so henceforth make no secret of thyrank and condition, nor let me hear aught from thee but thetruth; for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite.  And as thou artpierced by the shaft of Fate, be resignation thine and abidecontent to wait." When he heard her words he saw that artificeavailed him naught and he acknowledged the truth, saying, "I amSharrkan, bin Omar bin al-Nu'uman, whom fortune hath afflictedand cast into this place; so whatso thou willest, do it in mycase!" She hung her head groundwards a long while, then turned tohim and said, "Be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool andclear;[FN#187] for thou art the guest of my hospitality, andbread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee; whereforethou art in my ward and under my safeguard.  Have no fear for, bythe truth of the Messiah, if all on earth sought to do thee hurtthey should not come at thee, till life had left my body for thysake: indeed thou art now under the charge of the Messiah and ofme." Hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing withhim, till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired toslay him, she would have done so during the past night. Presently she bespoke in the Grecian tongue one of her slavegirls, who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and atray of food; but Sharrkan abstained from eating and said tohimself, "Haply she hath put somewhat in this meat." She knewwhat was in his thought; so she turned to him and said, "By thetruth of the Messiah, the case is not on such wise, nor is thereaught in this meat of what thou suspectest!  Had my mind been seton slaying thee, I had slain thee ere now." Then she walked up tothe tray and ate of every dish a mouthful; where upon Sharrkancame forward and ate too.  She was pleased at this and both atetill they were satisfied.  They washed their hands and after thatshe rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs ofsweet savour, wines of all colours and kinds and a wine-servicewith vessels of gold, silver and crystal.  She filled a firstgoblet and drank it off before offering it to him, even as shehad done with the food: then she crowned a second and handed itto him.  He drank and she said to him, "O Moslem, see how thouart here in all solace and delight of life!" And she ceased notto drink and ply him with drink, till he took leave of his wits,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased saying herpermitted say.               When it was the Forty-ninth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damselceased not to drink and ply Sharrkan with drink till he tookleave of his wits, for the wine and the intoxication of love hebore her.  Presently she said to the slave girl, "OMarjanah[FN#188]!  bring us some instruments of music!" "To hearis to obey," said the hand maid and going out, returned in thetwinkling of an eye with a Damascus lute,[FN#189] a Persian harp,a Tartar pipe, and an Egyptian dulcimer.  The young lady took thelute and, after tuning each several string, began in gentleundersong to sing, softer than zephyr's wing and sweeter thanTasmin[FN#190] spring, with heart safe and secure from everythingthe couplets following,"Allah assain those eyne!  What streams of blood they shed! * How     many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped.I love all lovers who to lovers show them cure; * 'Twere wrong to     rue the love in wrong head born and bred:Haply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens! * Heaven help     the hapless heart by force of thee misled!Thou doomest me to death who art my king, and I * Ransom with     life the deemster who would doom me dead."Thereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking aninstrument, played and recited couplets in the Roumi tongue; thentheir mistress sang also and seeing Sharrkan in ecstasies askedhim, "O Moslem, dost thou understand what I say?"; and heanswered, "Nay, my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy fingersips." She laughed and continued, "If I sing to thee in Arabicwhat wouldst thou do?" "I should no longer," quoth he, "be masterof my senses." Then she took an instrument and, changing themeasure, began singing these verses,"The smack of parting's myrrh to me, * How, then, bear patience'     aloe?I'm girt by ills in trinity          * Severance, distance,     cruelty!My freedom stole that fairest she,   * And parting irks me     bitterly."When she ended her verse, she looked at Sharrkan and found himlost to existence, and he lay for a while stretched at fulllength and prone among the maidens.[FN#191] Then he revived and,remembering the songs, again inclined to mirth and merriment; andthe twain returned to their wine and wassail, and continued theirplaying and toying, their pastime and pleasure till day ceasedilluminating and night drooped her wing.  Then the damsel wentoff to her dormitory and when Sharrkan asked after her theyanswered, "She is gone to her sleeping chamber," whereto herejoined, "Under Allah's ward and His good guard!" As soon as itwas morning, a handmaid came to him and said to him, "My mistressbiddeth thee to her." So he rose and followed her and, as he drewnear her lodging, the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabretsand songs of greeting, and led him through a great door of ivorystudded with pearls and jewels.  Thence they passed with him intoa tall and spacious hall, at the upper end of which was a widedais carpeted with all kinds of silks, and round it open latticescommanding a view of trees and streams.  About the saloon werefigures carved in human form, and fashioned on such wise that theair passed through them and set in motion musical instrumentswithin, so that the beholder would fancy they spoke.[FN#192] Heresat the young lady, looking at the figures; but when she sawSharrkan, she sprang to her feet and, taking him by the hand,made him sit down by her side, and asked him how he had passedthe night.  He blessed her and the two sat talking awhile tillshe asked him, "Knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves oflove?"; and he answered "Yes!  I wot somewhat in verse on thatmatter." "Let me hear it," quoth she, so he began quoting,"Pleasure and health, good cheer, good appetite * To Azzah,     freest with our name and fame!By Allah!  would I near her off she flies * At tangent, granting     less the more I claim:I dote on Azzah, but when clear I off * My rivals, clears me too     that dearest dame;Like wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud * Which, ere     siesta done, thin air became."When she heard this she said, "Verily Al-Kuthayyir[FN#193] wasconspicuous for sweet speech and chaste, and he was superlativein his praise of Azzah when he sang" (and she began to recite),"Did Azzah deal behest to Sun o' noon, * The judge had judged her     beauty's bestest boon;And girls who come to me and carp at her, * God make their rosy     cheeks her sandal-shoon!And indeed," quoth she, "'twas said that Azzah boasted exceedingbeauty and loveliness." Then she asked Sharrkan saying, "OPrince, cost thou know aught of Jamil's[FN#194] verses toButhaynah?  if so repeat to us somewhat of them;" and heanswered, "Yes, I know them better than any;" whereupon he beganrepeating these couplets,"Jamil, in Holy war go fight!" to me they say: * What war save     fight for fair ones would I e'er essay?To me their every word and work are mere delight, * And martyrs     crepe I all they slay in fight and fray:An ask I, 'O Buthaynah!  what's this love, I pray, * Which eats     my heart?' quoth she ' 'Twill stay for ever and aye!'And when I cry, 'Of wits return some small display * For daily     use,' quoth she, 'Far, far 'tis fled away!Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy * While I     no goal espy save thee and thee alway.'""Thou hast spoken right well," said she, "O King's son, and Jamilalso spoke excellently well.  But what would Buthaynah have donewith him that he saith in his hemistich,'Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy?'""O my lady," quoth Sharrkan, "she willed to do him what thouwillest to do with me, and even that will not satisfy thee." Shelaughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing tillDay put out her light and Night came in darkness dight.  Then sherose and went to her dormitory and slept, while Sharrkan slept inhis place till morning dawned.  As soon as he awoke, the handmaids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth andmerriment, as wont; and, kissing the ground between his hands,said to him, "Bismillah!  in Allah's name be so kind as tocome[FN#195]: our mistress biddeth thee to her presence!" So herose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him, playingon tabrets and other instruments of music, till they passed fromthat saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall, decoratedwith pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts, passingall description.  Sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice ofthe place and began reciting,"He plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry, * And her breast-    pearls that bedded in gold mine lie.Pure water on silvern bars is her brow, * And her cheeks show     roses with rubies vie:Meseems in her eyne that the violet's hue * Lies purpling set in     the Ithmid's[FN#196] dye."When the lady saw Sharrkan, she stood up to him in honour and,taking his hand, seated him by her side and asked, "O son of KingOmar bin al-Nu'uman, hast thou any cunning in the game of chess?""Yes," he answered, "but do not thou with me as said the poet,'I speak and longing love upties me and unties me; * Till with     her honey dew of inner lip she plies me:I brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me * With     white and black,[FN#197] but black cum white ne'er satisfies     me:'Twas as if King for Castle I were fain to place me * Till wilful     loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me:And if I seek to read intent in eyes that eye me * Oh man!  that     glance askance with hint of wish defies me.'"Then she brought the chessboard and played with him; butSharrkan, instead of looking at her moves, kept gazing at herfair mouth, and putting knight in place of elephant andelephant[FN#198] instead of knight.  She laughed and said to him,"If thy play be after this fashion, thou knowest naught of thegame." "This is only our first," replied he, "judge not by thisbout." When she beat him he replaced the pieces in position andplayed again with her; but she beat him a second time, a third, afourth and a fifth.  So she turned to him and said, "Thou artbeaten in everything;" and he replied, "O my lady, how should oneplaying with the like of thee avoid being beaten?" Then she badebring food, and they ate and washed their hands; after which thewine was set before them and they drank.  Presently, she took thedulcimer, for her hand was cunning in smiting it, and she beganrepeating to an accompaniment these couplets,"Twixt the close tied and open wide no medium Fortune knoweth, *     Now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness     showeth.Then drink her wine the syne she's thine and smiling thou dost     find her * Anon she'll fall and fare away when all thy good     forth goeth."They ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day waspleasanter even than the first.  When darkness set in, the ladybetook her to her dormitory, leaving him alone with the handmaids; so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn,when the damsels came to him with tambourines and otherinstruments according to custom.  Seeing them he roused himhastily and sat up; and they carried him to their mistress, whocame to meet him and, taking him by the hand, seated him by herside.  Then she asked him how he had passed his night, whereat heprayed that her life be prolonged; and she took the lute and sangto it these verses which she improvised,"Ne'er incline thee to part * Which embitters the heartE'en the sun when he sets   * Shall in pallor depart."While they were solacing themselves after this fashion, behold,there arose a great and sudden clamour, and a confused crowd ofknights and men rushed in, holding drawn swords that glitteredand gleamed in their hands, and cried aloud in the Grecian tongue"Thou hast fallen into our hands, O Sharrkan, so make thee sureof death!" When he heard this, he said to himself, "By Allah, shehath entrapped me and held me in play, till her men should come. These are the Knights with whom she threatened me; but 'tis I whohave thrown myself into this strait." Then he turned towards theyoung lady to reproach her, but saw that she had changed colourand her face was pale; and she sprang to her feet and asked thecrowd, "Who are ye?" "O most gracious Princess and peerless onionpearl," answered the leading Knight, "dost thou weet who is yonman by thy side?" "Not I," she replied, "who may he be?" Quoththe Patrician, "This is of towns the highwayman!  This is he whorideth in the horseman's van!  This is Sharrkan, son of King Omarbin al-Nu'uman!  This is he that forceth fortalice andpenetrateth every impregnable place!  The news of him reachedKing Hardub, thy father, by report of the ancient dame Zat al-Dawahi; and thy sire, our sovereign, hath made sure that thouhast rendered good service to the army of the Greeks by takingcaptive this ominous lion." When she heard this, she looked atthe Knight and asked him, "What be thy name?" and he answered, "Iam Masurah, son of thy slave Mausurah bin Kashardah, Knight ofKnights." "And how?" quoth she, "durst thou enter my presencewithout leave?" Quoth he, "O my lady, when I came to the gate,none forbade me, neither chamberlain nor porter, but all the doorkeepers rose and forewent us as of wont; although, when otherscome, they leave them standing at the gate while they askpermission to admit them.  But this is not a time for longtalking, when the King is expecting our return with this Prince,the scorpion sting[FN#199] of the Islamitic host, that he maykill him and drive back his men whither they came, without thebane of battling with them." "These words be ill words," rejoinedthe Princess, "and Dame Zat al-Dawahi lied, avouching an idlething and a vain, whereof she weeteth not the truth; for by thevirtue of the Messiah, this man who is with me is not Sharrkan,nor is he a captive, but a stranger who came to us seeking ourhospitality, and I made him my guest.  So even were we assuredthat this be Sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is hebeyond a doubt, I say it would ill befit mine honour that Ishould deliver into your hands one who hath entered under myprotection.  So make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgraceamong men; but return to the King, my father, and kiss the groundbefore him, and inform him that the case is contrariwise to thereport of the Lady Zat al-Dawahi." "O Abrizah," replied Masurah,the Knight, "I cannot return to the King's majesty without hisdebtor and enemy." Quoth she (and indeed she had waxed verywroth).  "Out on thee!  Return to him with my answer, and noblame shall befal thee!" Quoth Masurah, "I will not returnwithout him." Thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed,"Exceed not in talk and vain words; for verily this man had notcome in to us, were he not assured that he could of himself andsingle handed make head against an hundred riders; and if I saidto him, 'Thou art Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman,' hewould answer, 'Yes.' But 'tis not of your competence to let orhinder him; for if you do so, he will not turn back from you tillhe hath slain all that are in this place.  Behold, here he is bymy side, and I will bring him before you sword and targe inhand." "Albeit I were safe from thy wrath," answered Masurah theKnight, "I am not safe from that of thy father, and when I seehim, I shall sign to the Knights to take him captive, and we willcarry him to the King bound and in abject sort." When she heardthis, she said, "The matter shall not pass thus, for 'twould beblazoning mere folly.  This man is but one and ye are an hundredKnights: so if you would attack him come out against him, oneafter one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiantamongst you."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceasedto say her permitted say.                When it was the Fiftieth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that PrincessAbrizah said to the Knight, "This man is but one, and ye are anhundred: so if ye would attack him, come out against him, oneafter one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant."Quoth Masurah, the Knight, "By the truth of the Messiah, thousayest sooth, and none but I shall sally out against him first."Quoth she, "Wait till I go to him and acquaint him with the caseand hear what answer he will make.  If he consent, 'tis well; butif he refuse, ye shall on no wise come to him, for I and my handmaids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom." So shewent to Sharrkan and told him the news, whereat he smiled andknew that she had not informed any of the Emirs; but that tidingsof him had been bruited and blazed abroad, till the reportreached the King, against her wish and intent.  So he again beganreproaching himself and said, "How came I to adventure and playwith my life by coming to the country of the Greeks?" But hearingthe young lady's proposal he said to her, "Indeed their onset,one after one, would be overburdensome to them.  Will they notcome out against me, ten by ten?" "That would be villainy," saidshe; "Let one have at one." When he heard this, he sprang to hisfeet and made for them with his sword and battle gear; andMasurah, the Knight, also sprang up and bore down upon him. Sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut[FN#200]which clove him to the middle, and the blade came out gleamingand glittering from his back and bowels.  When the lady beheldthat swashingblow, Sharrkan's might was magnified in her sightand she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it wasnot by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness.  So sheturned to the Knights and said, "Take wreak for your chief!"Thereupon out came the slain man's brother, a fierce and furiousKnight, and rushed upon Sharrkan, who delayed not, but smote himalso with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering fromhis vitals.  Then cried the Princess, "O ye servants of theMessiah, avenge your comrade!" So they ceased not charging downupon him, one after one; and Sharrkan also ceased not playingupon them with the blade, till he had slain fifty Knights, thelady looking on the while.  And Allah cast a panic into thehearts of the survivors, so that they held back and dared notmeet him in the duello, but fell upon him in a body; and he laidon load with heart firmer than a rock, and smote them and trodthem down like straw under the threshing sled,[FN#201] till hehad driven sense and soul out of them.  Then the Princess calledaloud to her damsels, saying, "Who is left in the convent?"; andthey replied, "None but the gate keepers;" whereupon she went upto Sharrkan and took him to her bosom, he doing the same, andthey returned to the palace, after he had made an end of themelee.  Now there remained a few of the Knights hiding from himin the cells of the monastery, and when the Princess saw this sherose from Sharrkan's side and left him for a while, but presentlycame back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding inher hand a fine Indian scymitar.  And she said, "Now by the truthof the Messiah, I will not be a niggard of myself for my guest;nor will I abandon him though for this I abide a reproach and aby word in the land of the Greeks." Then she took reckoning ofthe dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the Knights,and other twenty had taken to flight.[FN#202] When she saw whatwork he had made with them she said to him, "Allah bless thee, OSharrkan!  The Cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee."Then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slainbegan reciting these couplets,"How oft in the mellay I've cleft the array, * And given their     bravest to lions a prey:Ask of me and of them when I proved me prow * O'er creation, on     days of the foray and fray:When I left in the onslaught their lions to lie * On the sands of     the low lands[FN#203] in fieriest day."When he ended his verse, the Princess came up to him with smilesand kissed his hand; then she doffed her hauberk and he said toher, "O lady mine, wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail andbare thy brand?" "To guard thee against these caitiffs,"[FN#204]she replied.  Then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them,"How came ye to admit the King's Knights into my dwelling withoutleave of me?"; and they answered, "O Princess, it is not ourcustom to ask leave of thee for the King's messengers, andespecially for the chief of his Knights." Quoth she, "I think yewere minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest;" and badeSharrkan smite their necks.  He did so and she cried to the restof her servants, "Of a truth, they deserved even more than that!"Then turning to Sharrkan, she said to him, "Now that there hathbecome manifest to thee what was concealed, thou shalt be madeacquainted with my history.  Know, then, that I am the daughterof King Hardub of Roum; my name is Abrizah and the ancient dame,yclept Zat al-Dawahi, is my grandmother by the sword side.  Sheit certainly is who told my father of thee, and as surely shewill compass a sleight to slay me, more by token as thou hastslain my father's chivalry and it is noised abroad that I haveseparated myself from the Nazarenes and have become no betterthan I should be with the Moslems.  Wherefore it were wiser thatI leave this dwelling while Zat al-Dawahi is on my track; but Irequire of thee the like kindness and courtesy I have shown thee,for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thineaccount.  So do not thou neglect to do aught that I shall say tothee, remembering all this betided me not save by reason ofthee." Hearing her words, Sharrkan joyed greatly; his breastbroadened and his wits flew from him for delight, and he said,"By Allah, none shall come at thee, while life is in my bosom! But hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thypeople?" "Even so," she answered; and Sharrkan swore to her andthe two plighted their troth.  Then said she, "Now is my heart atease; but there remaineth one other condition for thee." "What isit?" asked he and she answered, "It is that thou return with thyhost to thine own country." Quoth he, "O lady mine, my father,King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, sent me to wage war upon thy sire, onaccount of the treasure he plundered from the King ofConstantinople, and amongst the rest three great jewels, notedgivers of good fortune." Quoth she, "Cheer thy heart and clearthine eyes: I will tell thee the whole of the tale and the causeof our feud with the King of Constantinople.  Know that we have ayearly festival, highs the Convent Feast, whereat Kings from allquarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate; thitheralso come merchants and traders with their wives and families,and the visitors abide there seven days.  I was wont to be one ofthem; but, when there befel enmity between us, my father forbademe to be present at the festival for the space of seven years. One year, it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great whoresorted to the patron, as was their custom, came a daughter ofthe King of Constantinople, a beautiful girl called Sophia.  Theytarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folkwent their ways;[FN#205] but Sophia said, 'I will not return toConstantinople save by water.' So they equipped for her a ship inwhich she embarked with her suite; and making sail they put outto sea; but as they were voyaging behold, a contrary wind caughtthem and drove the vessel from her course till, as Fate andFortune would have it, she fell in with a Nazarene craft from theCamphor Island[FN#206] carrying a crew of five hundred armedFranks, who had been cruising about a long time.  When theysighted the sails of the ship, wherein Sophia and her women were,they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they cameup with her, then they laid the grappling irons aboard her andcaptured her.  Then taking her in tow they made all sail fortheir own island and were but a little distant from it when thewind veered round and, splitting their sails, drove them on to ashoal which lies off our coast.  Thereupon we sallied forth and,looking on them as spoil driven to us by Fate,[FN#207] boardedand took them; and, slaying the men, made prize of the wreck,wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and fortymaidens, amongst whom was the King's daughter, Sophia.  After thecapture we carried the Princess and her women to my father, notknowing her to be a daughter of King Afridun of Constantinople;and he chose out for himself ten including her; and divided therest among his dependents.  Presently he set apart five damsels,amongst whom was the King s daughter, and sent them to thyfather, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, together with other gifts, suchas broadcloth[FN#208] and woollen stuffs and Grecian silks.  Thyfather accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girlsSophia, daughter of King Afridun; nor did we hear more of hertill the beginning of this year, when her father wrote to myfather in words unfitting for me to repeat, rebuking him withmenaces and saying to him: Two years ago, you plundered a ship ofours which had been seized by a band of Frankish pirates in whichwas my daughter, Sophia, attended by her maidens numbering somethreescore.  Yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger orotherwise; nor could I make the matter public, lest reproachbefal me amongst the Kings, by reason of my daughter's honour. So I concealed my case till this year, when I wrote to certainFrankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the Kingsof the Isles.  They replied, 'By Allah we carried her not forthof thy realm; but we have heard that King Hardub rescued her fromcertain pirates.  And they told me the whole tale.' Then he addedin the writing which he writ to my father: 'Except you wish to beat feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour mydaughter, you will, the instant my letter reacheth you, send mydaughter back to me.  But if you slight my letter and disobey mycommandment, I will assuredly make you full return for your fouldealing and the baseness of your practices.'[FN#209] When myfather read this letter and understood the contents,[FN#210] itvexed him and he regretted not having known that Sophia, KingAfridun's daughter, was among the captured damsels, that he mighthave sent her back to her sire; and he was perplexed about thecase because, after so long a time, he could not send to KingOmar bin al-Nu'uman and demand her back from him, especially ashe had lately heard that Heaven had granted him boon of babe bythis Sophia.  So when we pondered that truth, we knew that thisletter was none other than a grievous calamity; and my fatherfound nothing for it but to write an answer to King Afridun,making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that heknew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the shipand setting forth how he had sent her to King Omar bin alNu'uman, who had gotten the blessing of issue by her.  When myfather's reply reached King Afridun he rose up and satdown,[FN#211] and roared and foamed at the mouth crying:--'What!shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girlsand pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift toKings, and they lie with her without marriage contract?  By theMessiah and the true Faith,' said he, 'I will not desist till Ihave taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out myshame; and indeed I will do a deed which the chroniclers shallchronicle after me!' So he bided his time till he devised adevice and laid notable toils and snares, when he sent an embassyto thy father, King Omar, to tell him that which thou hast heard:accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee andsent thee to King Afridun, whose object is to seize thee andthine army to boot.  As for the three jewels whereof he told thyfather when asking his aid, there was not one soothfast word inthat matter, for they were with Sophia, his daughter; and myfather took them from her, when he got possession of her and ofher maidens, and gave them to me in free gift, and they are nowwith me.  So go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they beled deep into, and shut in by, the land of the bevy of damsels inthe ship and setting forth the Franks and the country of theGreeks; for as soon as you have come far enough into theirinterior, they will stop the roads upon you and there will be noescape for you till the Day of retribution and retaliation.  Iknow that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them,because thou didst order a three days' rest; withal they havemissed thee all this time and they wot not what to do." WhenSharrkan heard her words, he was absent awhile in thought; thenhe kissed Princess Abrizah's hand and said, "Praise be to Allahwho hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the causeof my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me!  But 'tisgrievous to me to part from thee and I know not what will becomeof thee after my departure." "Go now to thine army," she replied,"and turn them back, while ye are yet near your own country.  Ifthe envoys be still with them, lay hands on them and keep them,that the case may be made manifest to you; and, after three days,I will be with you all and we will enter Baghdad together." As heturned to depart she said, "Forget not the compact which isbetween me and thee," then she rose to bid[FN#212] him farewelland embrace him and quench the fire of desire, so she took leaveof him and, throwing her arms round his neck, wept with exceedingweeping, and repeated these verses,"I bade adieu, my right hand wiped my tears away, * The while my     left hand held her in a close embrace:'Fearest thou naught,' quoth she, 'of shame?'  I answered 'Nay, *     The lover's parting day is lover's worst disgrace.'"Then Sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent.  Theybrought his steed, so he mounted and rode down stream to thedrawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodlandpaths and passed into the open meadow.  As soon as he was clearof the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on thealert, and he bared his brand and rode cautiously, but as theydrew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them andbehold, it was the Wazir Dandan and two of his Emirs.  When theysaw him and knew him, they dismounted and saluting him, asked thereason of his absence; whereupon he told them all that had passedbetween him and Princess Abrizah from first to last.  The Wazirreturned thanks to Almighty Allah for his safety andsaid,[FN#213] "Let us at once leave these lands; for the envoyswho came with us are gone to inform the King of our approach, andhaply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners." SoSharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount, which they didand, setting out at once, they stinted not faring till theyreached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay.  TheAmbassadors meanwhile had reported Sharrkan's approach to theirKing, who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and thosewith him.  But Sharrkan, escorted by the Wazir Dandan and the twoEmirs, had no sooner sighted the army, than he raised the cry"March!  March!" They took horse on the instant and fared throughthe first day and second and third day, nor did they cease faringfor five days; at the end of which time they alighted in a wellwooded valley, where they rested awhile.  Then they again set outand stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed themon the frontiers of their own country.  Here, deeming themselvessafe, they halted to rest; and the country people came out tothem with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage forthe beasts.  They tarried there two days after which, as allwould be making for their homes, Sharrkan put the Wazir Dandan incommand, bidding him lead the host back to Baghdad.  But hehimself remained behind with an hundred riders, till the rest ofthe army had made one day's march: then he called "To horse!" andmounted with his hundred men.  They rode on twoparasangs'[FN#214] space till they arrived at a gorge between twomountains and lo!  there arose before them a dark cloud of sandand dust.  So they checked their steeds awhile till the dustopened and lifted, discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers,lion faced and in mail coats cased.  As soon as they drew withinearshot of Sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them, saying,"By the virtue of John and Mary, we have won to our wish!  Wehave been following you by forced marches, night and day, till weforewent you to this place.  So dismount and lay down your armsand yield yourselves, that we may grant you your lives." WhenSharrkan heard this, his eyes stood out from his head and hischeeks flushed red and he said 'How is it, O.  Nazarene dogs, yedare enter our country and overmatch our land?  And doth not thissuffice you, but ye must adventure yourselves and address us insuch unseemly speech?  Do you think to escape out of our handsand return to your country?" Then he shouted to his hundredhorsemen, "Up and at these hounds, for they even you in number!"So saying, he bared his sabre and bore down on them, he and his,but the Franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks, and wightdashed against wight, and knight dashed upon knight, and hotwaxed the fight, and sore was the affright, and nor parley norcries of quarter helped their plight; and they stinted not tocharge and to smite, right hand meeting right, nor to hack andhew with blades bright white, till day turned to night and gloomoppressed the sight.  Then they drew apart and Sharrkan musteredhis men and found none wounded save four only, who showed hurtsbut not death hurts.  Said he to them, "By Allah, my life longhave I waded in the clashing sea of fight and I have met many agallant sprite, but none so unfrightened of the sword that smitesand the shock of men that affrights like these valiant Knights!""Know, O King," said they, that there is among them a Frankishcavalier who is their leader and, indeed, he is a man of valourand fatal is his spear thrust: but, by Allah, he spares us greatand small; for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go andforbears to slay him.  By Allah, had he willed he had killed usall." Sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the Knight haddone and such high report of him, so he said, "When the mornshall morrow, we will draw out and defy them, for we are anhundred to their hundred; and we will seek aid against them fromthe Lord of the Heavens." So they rested that night in suchintent; whilst the Franks gathered round their Captain and said,"Verily this day we did not win our will of these;" and hereplied, "At early dawn when the morrow shall morn, we will drawout and challenge them, one after one." They also rested in thatmind, and both camps kept guard until Almighty Allah sent thelight of day dawn.  Thereupon King Sharrkan and his hundredriders took horse and rode forth to the plain, where they foundthe Franks ranged in line of battle; and Sharrkan said to hisfollowers, "Our foes have determined like ourselves to do theirdevoir; so up and at them and lay on load." Then came forth anHerald of the Franks and cried out, saying, "Let there be nogeneral engagement betwixt us this day, save by the duello, achampion of yours against a champion of ours." Whereupon one ofSharrkan's riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between thetwo lines crying, "Ho!  who is for smiting?  Let no dastardengage me this day nor niderling!" Hardly had he made an end ofhis vaunt, when there sallied forth to him a Frankish cavalier,armed cap-a-pie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff, riding on agrey white steed,[FN#215] and he had no hair on his cheeks.  Heurged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the twofell to derring do of cut and thrust, but it was not long beforethe Frank foined the Moslem with the lance point; and, topplinghim from his steed, took him prisoner and led him offcrestfallen.  His folk rejoiced in their comrade and, forbiddinghim to go out again to the field, sent forth another, to whomsallied out another Moslem, brother to the captive, and offeredhim battle.  The two fell to, either against other, and foughtfor a little while, till the Frank bore down upon the Moslem and,falsing him with a feint, tumbled him by a thrust of the lanceheel from his destrier and took him prisoner.  After this fashionthe Moslems ceased not dashing forwards, one after one, and theFranks to unhorse them and take them captive, till day departedand the night with darkness upstarted.  Now they had captured ofthe Moslems twenty cavaliers, and when Sharrken saw this, it wasgrievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them, "Whatis this thing that hath befallen us?  To- morrow, I myself willgo forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chiefand learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn himagainst doing battle with our band.  If he persist, we willpunish him with death, and if he prove peaceable we will makepeace with him." They righted on this wise till Allah Almightycaused the morn to dawn, when mounted the twain and drew up forbattle fain; and Sharrkan was going forth to the plain, butbehold, more than one half of the Franks dismounted and remainedon foot before one of them who was mounted, till they reached themidst of the battle plain.  Sharrken looked at that horseman andlo!  he was their chief.  He was clad in a surcoat of blue satinand a close ringed mail shirt; his face was as the moon when itrises and no hair was upon his cheeks.  He hent in hand an Indianscymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow,like a dirham; and he smote the horse with heel till he stoodalmost in the midst of the field when, signing to the Moslems, hecried out in fluent Arab speech "Ho, Sharrkan!  Ho, son of Omarbin al- Nu'uman!  Ho, thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowestcities and countries!  up and out to battle bout, and bladesingle handed wield with one who halves with thee the field! Thou art Prince of thy people and I am Prince of mine; and whosoovercometh his adversary, him let the other's men obey and comeunder his sway." Hardly had he ended his speech, when out cameSharrkan with a heart full of fury, and urging his steed into themidst of the field, closed like a raging lion with the Frank whoencountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him withthe meeting of warriors.  Then they fell to foining and hewing,and they stinted not of onset and offset, and give and take, asthey were two mountains clashing together or two seas togetherdashing; nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and nightstarkened.  Then they drew apart and each returned to his ownparty; but as soon as Sharrkan foregathered with his comrades, hesaid, "Never looked I on the like of this cavalier: he hath onequality I have not yet seen in any and this it is that, when hisfoemen uncovereth a place for the death blow, he reverseth hisweapon and smiteth with the lance-heel!  In very deed I know notwhat will be the issue 'twixt him and me; but 'tis my wish thatwe had in our host his like and the like of his men." Then hewent to his rest for the night and, when morning dawned, theFrank came forth and rode down to the mid field, where Sharrkanmet him; and they fell to fighting and to wheeling, left andright; and necks were stretched out to see the sight, nor didthey stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance withmain and might, till the day turned to night and darknessoverwhelmed the light.  Then the twain drew asunder and returnedeach to his own camp, where both related to their comrades whathad befallen them in the duello; and at last the Frank said tohis men, "Tomorrow shall decide the matter!" So they both passedthat night restfully till dawn; and, as soon as it was day, theymounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight tillhalf the day was done.  Then the Frank bethought him of a ruse;first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with therein, so that he stumbled and fell with his rider; thereuponSharrkan threw himself on the foe, and would have smitten himwith the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged, when theFrank cried out to him, "O Sharrkan, champions are not wont to dothus!  This is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by awoman."[FN#216] When Sharrkan heard this, he raised his eyes tothe Frank's face and gazing steadfastly at him, recognized in himPrincess Abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallenhim in the convent; whereupon he cast brand from hand and,kissing the earth before her, asked her, "What moved thee to adeed like this?"; and she answered, "I desired to prove thyprowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting. These that are with me are my handmaids, and they are all cleanmaids; yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press andstress of plain; and had not my steed stumbled with me, thoushouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat." Sharrkansmiled at her speech and said, "Praise be to Allah for safety andfor my reunion with thee, O Queen of the age!" Then she cried outto her damsels to loose the twenty captives of Sharrkan's troopand dismount.  They did as she bade and came and kissed the earthbefore her and Sharrkan who said to them, "It is the like of youthat Kings keep in store for the need hour." Then he signed tohis comrades to salute the Princess; so all alighted and kissedthe earth before her, for they knew the story.  After this, thewhole two hundred took horse, and fared on night and day for sixdays' space, till they drew near to Baghdad, when they halted andSharrkan bade Abrizah and her handmaids doff the Frankish garbthat was on them,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased saying her permitted say.               When it was the Fifty-first Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkanbade Princess Abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was onthem and don the garments of daughters of Greece; and thus didthey.  Then he despatched a company of his companions to Baghdadto acquaint his father Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with his arrival andreport that he was accompanied by Princess Abrizah, daughter ofKing Hardub, Lord of Graecia-land.  They halted forthright in theplace they had reached, and Sharrkan also halted and all rightedthere; and when Almighty Allah made morning dawn, Sharrkan andhis company and Abrizah and her company took horse and fared ontowards the city; when lo!  on the way they met the Wazir Dandan,who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour Abrizah andSharrkan, by especial commandment of King Omar Son of Al-Nu'uman.  When the two drew near, they turned towards them andkissed ground before them; then they mounted again and escortedthem into the city and went up with them to the palace.  Sharrkanwalked in to his father, who rose and embraced him and questionedhim of his case.  So he told him all that Abrizah had told him,and what had passed between them and said, "She hath parted fromher sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take partwith us and make her abode with us; and indeed," he said to hisfather, "the King of Constantinople hath plotted to do us amischief, because of his daughter Sophia, for that the King ofGreece had made known to him her story and the cause of her beinggiven to thee; and he (the Grecian King) not knowing her to bedaughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople; and, had heknown that, he would not have bestowed her upon thee, but hewould have restored her to her parent.  And of a verity," hecontinued, "we were saved from these perils only by the LadyAbrizah, and never saw we a more valiant than she." And he wenton to tell his father all that had passed from first to last ofthe wrestling and the single fighting.  When King Omar heard thestory of Sharrkan, Abrizah was exalted in his eyes, and he longedto see her and question her.  Thereupon Sharrkan went out to herand said, "The King calleth for thee;" she replied, "I hear and Iobey;" and he took her and brought her in to his father, who wasseated on his throne and who, having dismissed his high officers,was attended only by his eunuchs.  The Princess entered andkissing the ground between his hands, saluted him in choiceterms.  He was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her forher dealing with his son Sharrkan and bade her be seated.  So shesat down and unveiled her face;[FN#217] and, when the King sawher beauty, his reason fled his head and he made her draw nearand showed her favour, appointing her an especial palace forherself and her damsels, and assigning them solde and allowances. Then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid, and sheanswered, "Here be they with me, O King of the age!" So saying,she rose and going to her lodging, unpacked her baggage and fromit brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold.  Sheopened the casket and taking out those three jewels, kissed themand gave them to the King.  Then she went away bearing his heartwith her.  After her going the King sent for his son Sharrkan andgave him one jewel of the three, and when he enquired of theother two replied, "O my son!  I mean to give one to thy brotherZau al-Makan, and the other to thy sister Nuzhat al- Zaman." Butwhen Sharrkan heard that he had a brother (for to that time heknew only of his sister) he turned to his sire and said to him,"O King, hast thou a son other than myself?" He answered, "Yes,and he is now six years old;" adding that his name was Zau al-Makan and that he and Nuzhat al-Zaman were twins, born at abirth.  This news was grievous to Sharrkan, but he kept hissecret and said, "The bless- ing of Allah Most High be uponthem!", and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dustoff his clothes.  Quoth the King, "How do I see thee change thymanner when hearing of this, considering that after me thoubecomes" heir of the kingdom.  Of a truth the troops have swornto thee and the Emirs and Grandees have taken the oath ofsuccession to thee; and this one of the three jewels is thine."Sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandywords with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away,knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath, and stayed notwalking till he had entered Abrizah's palace.  As he approachedshe stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done andprayed for blessings on him and his sire.  Then she sat down andseated him by her side; but when he had taken his place she sawrage in his face and questioned him, whereupon he told her thatAllah had blessed his father with two children by Sophia, a boyand a girl, and that he had named the boy Zau al-Makan and thegirl Nuzhat al-Zaman; adding, "He hath kept the other two jewelsfor them and hath given me one of thine, so I left it behind; Iknew naught of Zau al-Makan's birth till this day, and the twainare now six years old.  So when I learnt this, wrath possessedme; and I tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing fromthee.  But now I fear lest my father take thee to wife, for heloveth thee and I saw in him signs of desire for thee: so whatwilt thou say, if he wish this?" Quoth she, "Know, O Sharrkan,that thy father hath no dominion over me, nor can he have mewithout my consent; and if he prevail over me by force, I willtake my own life.  As for the three jewels, it was not my intentthat he should give any of them to either of his children and Ihad no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury withhis things of price; but now I desire of thy favour that thoumake me a present of the jewel which he gave thee, if thou haveaccepted it." "Hearkening and obedience," replied Sharrkan, andgave it to her.  Then said she, "Fear nothing," and talked withhim awhile and continued, "I fear lest my father hear that I amwith you and sit not patiently under my loss, but do hisendeavours to find me; and to that end he may ally himself withKing Afridun, on account of his daughter Sophia, and both come onthee with armies and so there befal great turmoil." When Sharrkenheard these words, he said to her, "O my lady, if it please theeto sojourn with us, take no thought of them; though there gathertogether against us all that be on land and on sea." " 'Tiswell," rejoined she; "if ye entreat me fair, I will tarry withyou, and if ye deal evilly by me, I will depart from you." Thenshe bade her slave maidens bring food; so they set the tables,and Sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house,disturbed and perturbed.  Such was his case; but regarding theaffairs of his father, Omar bin al-Nu'uman, after dismissing hisson Sharrkan he arose and, taking the other two jewels, betookhimself to the Lady Sophia, who stood up when she saw him andremained standing till he was seated.  Presently, his twochildren, Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman, came to him and hekissed them and hung a jewel round each one's neck, at which theyrejoiced and kissed his hands.  Then went they to their mother,who joyed in their joy and wished the King long life; so he askedher, "Why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou artthe daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, that Imight have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignityand raised thy rank?" "O King," answered Sophia, "and what couldI desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee,overwhelmed as I am with thy favours and thy benefits?  And,furthermore, Allah hath blessed me with two children by thee, ason and a daughter." Her reply pleased the King and after leavingher, he set apart for her and her children a wondrous finepalace.  Moreover, he appointed for them eunuchs and attendantsand doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers andphysicians and surgeons to do them service; and in every way heredoubled his favour and entreated them with the best oftreatment.  And presently he returned to the palace of hisdominion and to his Court where he distributed justice among thelieges.  So far concerning him and Sophia and her children; butin the matter of Abrizah the King was greatly occupied with loveof her and burnt with desire of her night and day; and everynight, he would go in to her and converse with her and pay hiscourt to her, but she gave him no answer, only saying, "O King ofthe age!  I have no desire for men at this present." When he sawher withdraw from him, his passion waxed hotter and his longingand pining increased until, when weary of this, he summoned hisWazir Dandan and, opening his very heart to him, told him of hislove for Princess Abrizah, daughter of Hardub, and informed himhow she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her wasdoing him to die, for that he could get no grace of her.  TheWazir, hearing these words, said to the King, "As soon as it isdark night, take thou a piece of Bhang the measure of a miskal,about an ounce, and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine withher.  When the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near, fillher a last cup and dropping therein the Bhang, give it to her todrink, and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drugtake effect on her.  Then do thou go in to her and take thy willof her; and such is my advice."[FN#218] "Thy rede is aright,"quoth the King, and seeking his treasury, he took thence a pieceof concentrated Bhang, if an elephant smelt it he would sleepfrom year to year.  This he put in his bosom pocket and waitedtill some little of the night went by, when he betook himself tothe palace of Princess Abrizah, who seeing him stood up toreceive him; but he bade her sit down.  So she sat down, and hesat by her, and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail,whereupon she furnished the carousing table[FN#219] and placed itbefore him.  Then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted thecandles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and allthat pertaineth to drinking.  So they fell to tippling and theKing ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into herhead; and seeing this he took out the bit of Bhang from hispocket and, holding it between his fingers, filled a cup with hisown hand and drank it off.  Then filling a second he said, "Tothy companionship!"; and dropped the drug into her cup, sheknowing naught of it.  She took it and drank it off; then sherose and went to her sleeping chamber.  He waited for less thanan hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on herand had robbed her of her senses, when he went in to her andfound her thrown on her back: and she had doffed her petticoattrousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discoveredwhat was between her thighs.  When the King saw the state ofthings and found a lighted candle at her head and another at herfeet, shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of hisfive senses for lust and Satan seduced him and he could notmaster himself, but put off his trousers and fell upon her andabated her maiden head.  Then he rose off her and went to one ofher women, by name Marjanah, and said, "Go in to thy lady andspeak with her." So she went in to her mistress and found herlying on her back insensible, with the blood running down to thecalves of her legs, whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped awaythe blood and lay by her that night.  As soon as Almighty Allahbrought the dawn, the handmaid Marjanah washed her mistress'shands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face andmouth with it, where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up fromher inside that bit of Bhang like a bolus.[FN#220] Then sherevived and washed her hands and mouth and said to Marjanah,"Tell me what hath befallen me." So she told her what had passedand how she had found her, lying on her back, with the bloodrunning down, wherefore she knew that King Omar bin al-Nu'umanhad lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her. At this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired intoprivacy, saying to her damsels, "Deny me to whoso would come into me and say to him that I am ill, till I see what Allah will dowith me." Presently the news of her sickness came to the King; sohe sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries.  Some months she thuspassed in solitude, during which time the King's flame cooled andhis desire for her was quenched, so that he abstained from her. Now she had conceived by him, and when the months of childbreeding had gone by, her pregnancy appeared and her bellyswelled, and the world was straitened upon her, so she said toher handmaid Marjanah, "Know that it is not the folk who havewronged me, but I who sinned against my own self[FN#221] in thatI left my father and mother and country.  Indeed, I abhor life,for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is leftme.  I used, when I mounted my steed, to have the mastery of him,but now I am unable to ride.  If I be brought to bed among them Ishall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in thepalace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way ofshame; and if I return to my father, with what face shall I meethim or with what face shall I have recourse to him?  How wellquoth the poet,'Say, what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead *     Nor cup companion, nor a cup, nor place to house his head?'"Marjanah answered her, "It is thine to command; I will obey;" andAbrizah said, "I desire at once to leave this place secretly, sothat none shall know of me but thou; and return to my father andmy mother, for when flesh stinketh, there is naught for it butits own folk and Allah shall do with me e'en as He will." "OPrincess," Marjanah replied, "what thou wouldest do is well."Then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited forsome days till the King went out to chase and hunt, and his sonSharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojournthere awhile.  Then said she to Marjanah, "I wish to set out thisnight, but how shall I do against my destiny?  For already I feelthe pangs of labour and child birth, and if I abide other four orfive days, I shall be brought to bed here, and I shall be unableto travel to my country.  But this is what was written on myforehead." Then she considered awhile, and said to Marjanah,"Look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way,for I have no strength to bear arms." "By Allah, O my lady,"replied Marjanah, "I know none but a black slave called Al-Ghazban,[FN#222] who is one of the slaves of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; he is a valiant wight, and he keepeth guard at ourpalace gate.  The King appointed him to attend us, and indeed wehave overwhelmed him with our favours; so, lookye, I will go outand speak with him of this matter, and promise him some moniesand tell him that, if he have a mind to tarry with us, I willmarry him to whom he will.  He told me before to day that he hadbeen a highwayman; so if he consent to us we shall win our wishand reach to our own land." She rejoined, "Call him that I maytalk with him;" whereupon Marjanah fared forth and said to theslave, 'O Ghazban, Allah prosper thee, so thou fall in with whatmy lady saith to thee!" Then she took him by the hand and broughthim to the Princess, whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him,her heart took fright at him.  "How ever," she said to herself,"of a truth, Need giveth the law;" and she approached to speakwith him, yet her heart started away from him.  Presently shesaid, "O Ghazban, say me, wilt thou help me against the perfidiesof Fortune and conceal my secret if I discover it to thee?" Whenthe slave saw her, his heart was taken by storm and he fell inlove with her forthright and could not but reply; "O my mistress,whatsoever thou biddest me do, I will not depart therefrom."Quoth she, "I would have thee take me at this hour and take thismy handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the King's horsesand set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat ofprovaunt, and go with us to our own country; where, if thoudesire to abide with us, I will marry thee to her thou shaltchoose of my handmaidens, or, if thou prefer return to thine ownland, we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires" afterthou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee." When AlGhazban, heard this, he rejoiced with great joy and replied, "Omy lady, I will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go atonce and saddle the horses." Then he went away gladsome andsaying to himself, "I shall get my will of them and if they willnot yield to me, I will kill them both and take their riches."But he kept this his intent to himself, and presently returnedwith two camels and three head of horses, one of which he rode,and Princess Abrizah made Marjanah mount the second she mountingthe third, albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not hersoul for anguish.  And the slave ceased not travelling with themnight and day through the passes of the mountains, till thereremained but musingly march between them and their own country;when the travail pangs came upon Abrizah and she could no longerresist; so she said to Al-Ghazban, "Set me down, for the pains oflabour are upon me;" and cried to Marjanah, "Do thou alight andsit by me and deliver me." Then Marjanah dismounted from herhorse, and Al-Ghazban did in like sort, and they made fast thebridles and helped the Princess to dismount, for she was aswoonfrom excess of anguish.  When Al-Ghazban saw her on the ground,Satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishingit in her face, said "O my lady, vouchsafe me thy favours."Hearing these words she turned to him and said, "It remaineth forme only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refusedKings and Braves!"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the Fifty-second Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that PrincessAbrizah said to the black slave Al Ghazban, "It remaineth for meonly that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kingsand Braves!" And she was wroth with him and cried, "Woe to thee! what words are these thou sayest?  Out on thee, and talk not thusin my presence and know that I will never consent to what thousayest, though I drink the cup of death.  Wait till I have castmy burden and am delivered of the after birth, and then, if thoube able thereto, do with me as thou wilt; but, an thou leave notlewd talk at this time assuredly I will slay myself with my ownhand and quit the world and be at peace from all this." And shebegan reciting extempore,[FN#223]"O spare me, thou Ghazban, indeed enow for me * Are heavy strokes     of time, mischance and misery!Whoredom my Lord forfends to all humanity; * Quoth He, 'Who     breaks my bidding Hell for home shall see!'And if thou leave not suing me to whoredom's way * Against th'     Almighty's choicest gift, my chastity,Upon my tribesmen I with might and main will call * And gather     all, however far or near they be;And with Yamani blade were I in pieces hewn, * Ne'er shall he     sight my face who makes for villeiny,The face of free born come of noble folk and brave; * What then     can be to me the seed of whoreson slave?"When Ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly; his eyesreddened with blood and his face became a dusty grey[FN#224]; hisnostrils swelled, his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of hisaspect redoubled.  And he repeated these couplets,"Ho thou, Abrizah, mercy! leave me not for I * Of thy love and     Yamani[FN#225] glance the victim lieMy heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty, * My body wasted and my     patience done to die:From glances ravishing all hearts with witchery * Reason far     flies, the while desire to thee draws nigh;Though at thy call should armies fill the face of earth * E'en     now I'd win my wish and worlds in arms defy!"When Abrizah heard these words, she wept with sore weeping andsaid to him, "Woe to thee, O Ghazban!  How dareth the like ofthee to address me such demand, O base born and obscene bred? Dost thou deem all folk are alike?" When the vile slave heardthis from her, he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder: andhe came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neckwounded her to the death.  Then he drove her horse before himwith the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains. Such was the case with Al-Ghazban; but as regards Abrizah, shegave birth to a son, like the moon, and Marjanah took the babeand did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother'sside; and lo and behold!  the child fastened to its mother'sbreast and she dying.[FN#226]  When Marjanah saw this, she criedout with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on herhead and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed, saying, "Alas, mymistress!  Alas, the pity of it!  Thou art dead by the hand of aworthless black slave, after all thy knightly prowess!" And sheceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose andwalled the horizon;[FN#227] but, after awhile, it lifted anddiscovered a numerous conquering host.  Now this was the army ofKing Hardub, Princess Abrizah's father, and the cause of hiscoming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaidshaving fled to Baghdad, and that they were with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, he had come forth, leading those with him, to seektidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with theKing.  When he had gone a single day's march from his capital, heespied three horse men afar off and made towards them, intendingto ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter.  Now thesethree whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and Marjanahand the slave Al- Ghazban; and he made for them to push inquiry. Seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself; so hekilled Abrizah and fled for his life.  When they came up, KingHardub saw his daughter lying dead and Marjanah weeping over her,and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to theground.  All the riders of his company, the Emirs and Waxirs,took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain andset up for the King a great pavilion, domed and circular, withoutwhich stood the grandees of the realm.  When Marjanah saw hermaster, she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled; and,when he came to himself, he questioned her and she told him allthat had passed and said, "Of a truth he that hath slain thydaughter is a black slave belonging to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman,and she informed him how Sharrkan's father had dealt with thePrincess.  When King Hardub heard this, the world grew black inhis sight and he wept with sore weeping.  Then he called for alitter and, therein laying his dead daughter, returned toCaesarea and carried her into the palace, where he went in to hismother, Zat al-Dawahi, and said to that Lady of Calamities,"Shall the Moslems deal thus with my girl?  Verily King Omar binal-Nu'uman despoiled her of her honour by force, and after this,one of his black slaves slew her.  By the truth of the Messiah, Iwill assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear awayfrom mine honour the stain of shame; else will I kill myself withmine own hand!" And he wept passing sore.  Quoth his mother,"None other than Marjanah killed thy daughter, for she hated herin secret;" and she continued to her son, "Fret not for takingthe blood wit of thy daughter, for, by the truth of the Messiah,I will not turn back from King Omar bin al-Nu'uman till I haveslain him and his sons; and of a very truth I will do with him adeed, passing the power of Sage and Knight, whereof thechroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in everyplace: but needs must thou do my bidding in all I shall direct,for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surelycompass his desire." "By the virtue of the Messiah," replied he,"I will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say." Then quoth she,"Bring me a number of hand maids, high bosomed virgins, andsummon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophyand the rules of behaviour before Kings, and the art ofconversation and making verses; and let them talk with them ofall manner science and edifying knowledge.  And the sages must beMoslems, that they may teach them the language and traditions ofthe Arabs, together with the history of the Caliphs and theancient annals of the Kings of Al-Islam; and if we persevere inthis for four years' space, we shall gain our case.  So possessthy soul in patience and wait; for one of the Arabs saith, 'If wetake man bote after years forty the time were short to ye.' Whenwe have taught the girls these things, we shall be able to workour will with our foe, for he doteth on women and he hath threehundred and sixty concubines, whereto are now added an hundred ofthe flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter, shethat hath found mercy.[FN#228] As soon as I have made an end oftheir education, as described to thee, I will take them and setout with them in person." When King Hardub heard his mother'swords, he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head; and at oncedespatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifoldto fetch him Moslem sages.  They obeyed his commands and fared tofar countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors hesought.  When these came into presence, he honoured them withnotable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed tothem stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenasthey should have taught the damsels.  Then he committed thehandmaidens to their hands--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn ofday and ceased saying her permitted say.               When it was the Fifty-third Night.She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when thesages and the doctors stood in presence of King Hardub, hehonoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidensto their hands, enjoining that these be instructed in all mannerof knowledge, philosophy and polite accomplishments; and they setthemselves to do his bidding.  Such was the case with KingHardub; but as for King Omar bin al Nu'uman, when he returnedfrom coursing and hunting and entered his palace, he soughtPrincess Abrizah but found her not, nor any one knew of her norcould any give him news of her.  This was grievous to him and hesaid, "How could the lady leave the palace unknown of any?  Hadmy kingdom been at stake in this case, it were in perilouscondition there being none to govern it!  I will never again goto sport and hunt till I have stationed at the gates those whoshall keep good guard over them!"  And he was sore vexed and hisbreast was straitened for the loss of Princess Abrizah.  Hereuponbehold, his son Sharrkan returned from his journey; and thefather told him what had happened, and informed him how the ladyhad fled, whilst he was chasing and hunting, whereat he grievedwith exceeding grief.  Then King Omar took to visiting hischildren every day and making much of them and brought themlearned men and doctors to teach them, appointing for themstipends.  When Sharrkan saw this, he raged with exceeding rageand envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs ofchagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish byreason of this matter: so one day his father said to him, "Why doI see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face?" "O my father,"replied Sharrkan, "every time I see thee fondle my brother andsister and make much of them, jealousy seizeth on me, and I fearlest it grow on me till I slay them and thou slay me in return. And this is the reason of my weakness of body and change ofcomplexion.  But now I crave of thy favour that thou give me oneof thy castles outlying the rest, that I may abide there theremnant of my life, for as the sayer of bywords saith, 'Absencefrom my friend is better and fitter for me'; and, 'Whatso eyedoth not perceive, that garreth not heart to grieve.'" And hebowed his head towards the ground.  When King Omar bin al-Nu'umanheard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of hisbeing broken down, he soothed his heart and said to him, "O myson, I grant thee this and I have not in my reign a greater thanthe Castle of Damascus, and the government of it is thine fromthis time." Thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries ofstate and bade them write Sharrkan's patent of investiture to theviceroyalty of Damascus of Syria.  And when they had written it,he equipped him and sent with him the Wazir Dandan, and investedhim with the rule and government and gave him instructions as topolicy and regulations; and took leave of him, and the grandeesand officers of state did likewise, and he set out with his host. When he arrived at Damascus, the townspeople beat the drums andblew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet himin great state; whilst all the notables and grandees paced inprocession, and those who stood to the right of the throne walkedon his right flank, and the others to the left.  Thus farconcerning Sharrkan; but as regards his father, Omar bin al-Nu'uman, soon after the departure of his son, the children'stutors and governors presented themselves before him and said tohim, "O our lord, thy children have now learnt knowledge and theyare completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquetteof ceremony." The King rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy andconferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men, seeing Zau al-Makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship.  ThePrince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himselfwith piety and prayers, loving the poor, the Olema and the Koranstudents, so that all the people of Baghdad loved him, men andwomen.  One day, the procession of the Mahmil[FN#229] of Irakpassed round Baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage toMeccah and visitation of the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allahbless and preserve!).  When Zau al-Makan the Mahmil procession hewas seized with longing desire to become a pilgrim,[FN#230] so hewent in to his sire and said, "I come to ask thy leave to makethe pilgrimage." But his father forbade him saying, "Wait tillnext year and I will go and thou too." When the Prince saw thatthe matter was postponed, he betook himself to his sister Nuzhatal-Zaman, whom he found standing at prayer.  As soon as she hadended her devotions he said to her, "I am dying with desire ofpilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah at Meccah and to visit thetomb of the Prophet, upon whom be peace!  I asked my father'sleave, but he forbade me that, so I mean to take privily somewhatof money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge.""Allah upon thee," exclaimed she, "take me with thee and depriveme not of visitation to the tomb of the Prophet, whom Allah blessand keep!" And he answered, "As soon as it is dark night, do thoucome forth from this place, without telling any."Accordingly,When it was the middle of the night she arose andtook somewhat of money and donned a man's habit; and she ceasednot walking to the palace gate, where she found Zau al-Makan withcamels ready for marching.  So he mounted and mounted her; andthe two fared on till they were in the midst of the Iraki[FN#231]pilgrim-party, and they ceased not marching and Allah wrotesafety for them, till they entered Meccah the Holy and stood uponArafat and performed the pilgrimage rites.  Then they made avisitation to the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless andassain!) and thought to return with the pilgrims to their nativeland.  But Zau al-Makan said to his sister, "O my sister, it isin my mind to visit the Holy House,[FN#232] Jerusalem, andAbraham the Friend of Allah[FN#233] (on whom be peace!)." "I alsodesire so to do," replied she.  So they agreed upon this and hefared forth and took passage for himself and her and they madeready and set out in the ship with a company of Jerusalempalmers.  That very night the sister fell sick of an aguishchill, and was grievously ill but presently recovered, afterwhich the brother also sickened.  She tended him during hismalady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived atJerusalem, but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker andweaker.  They alighted at a Khan and there hired a lodging; butZau al- Makan's sickness ceased not to increase on him, till hewas wasted with leanness and became delirious.  At this, hissister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed, "There is no Majestyand there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the decree of Allah!" They sojourned in that placeawhile, his weakness ever increasing and she attending him andbuying necessaries for him and for herself, till all the moneyshe had was expended and she became so poor that she had not somuch as a dirham left.  Then she sent a servant of the Khan tothe bazar with some of her clothes, and he sold them and shespent the price upon her brother; then sold she something moreand she ceased not selling all she had, piece by piece, tillnothing was left but an old rug.  Whereupon she wept andexclaimed, "Verily is Allah the Orderer of the past and thefuture!" Presently her brother said to her, "O my sister, I feelrecovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roastmeat." "By Allah!  O my brother," replied she, "I have no face tobeg; but tomorrow I will enter some rich man's house and servehim and earn somewhat for our living." Then she bethought herselfawhile and said, "Of a truth 'tis hard for me to leave thee andthou in this state, but I must despite myself!" He rejoined,"Allah forbid!  Thou wilt be put to shame; but there is noMajesty and there is no Might save in Allah!" And he wept and shewept too.  Then she said, "O my brother, we are strangers whohave dwelt here a full year, but none hath yet knocked at ourdoor.  Shall we then die of hunger?  I know no resource but thatI go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive, tillthou recover from thy sickness, when we will travel back to ournative land." She sat weeping awhile and he wept too, proppedupon his elbow.  Then Nuzhat al-Zaman arose and, veiling her headwith a bit of camlet,[FN#234] which had been of the cameleer'sclothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them; shekissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forthfrom him, weeping and knowing not whither she should wend.  Andshe stinted not going and her brother Zau al-Makan awaiting herreturn till the supper time; but she came not, and he watched forher till the morning morrowed but still she returned not; andthis endured till two days went by.  He was greatly troubledthereat and his heart fluttered for her, and hunger was sore uponhim.  At last he left the chamber and, calling the servant of thecaravanserai, said, "I wish thee to bear me to the bazar." So hecarried him to the market street and laid him down there; and thepeople of Jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tearsseeing his condition.  He signed to them begging for somewhat toeat; so they brought him some money from certain of the merchantswho were in the bazar, and bought food and fed him therewith;after which they carried him to a shop, where they spread him amat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head.  Whennight fell, all the folk went away, sore concerned for him and,in the middle of the night, he called to mind his sister and hissickness redoubled on him, so that he abstained from eating anddrinking and became insensible to the world around him.  Then thebazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirtyseven dirhams, and hiring a camel, said to the driver, "Carrythis sick man to Damascus and leave him in the hospital; haply hemay be cured and recover health." "On my head be it!" replied thecamel man; but he said to himself, "How shall I take this sickman to Damascus, and he nigh upon death?" So he carried him awayto a place and hid with him till the night, when he threw himdown on the ash heap near the fire hole of a Hammam and went hisway.  When morning dawned the Stoker[FN#235] of the bath came tohis work and, finding Zau al-Makan cast on his back, exclaimed,"Why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here?" Sosaying, he gave him a kick and he moved; whereupon quoth theFireman, "Some one of you who hath eaten a bit of Hashish andhath thrown himself down in whatso place it be!" Then he lookedat his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace andcomeliness; so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick anda stranger in the land.  And he cried, "There is no Majesty andthere is no Might save in Allah!  verily, I have sinned againstthis youth, for indeed the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!)enjoineth honour to the stranger, more especially when thestranger is sick." Then he carried him home and went in with himto his wife and bade her tend him.  So she spread him a sleepingrug and set a cushion under his head, then warmed water for himand washed therewith his hands and feet and face.  Meanwhile, theStoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar,and sprinkled Zau al-Makan's face with the water and gave him todrink of the sherbet.  Then he fetched a clean shirt and put iton him.  With this, Zau al-Makan sniffed the zephyr of health andrecovery returned to him; and he sat up and leant against thepillow.  Hereat the Fireman rejoiced and exclaimed, "Praise be toAllah for the welfare of this youth!  O Allah, I beseech Thee byThy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make the salvation ofthis youth to be at my hands!"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawnof day and ceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the Fifty-fourth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Firemanexclaimed, "O Allah, I beseech Thee of Thy knowledge of hiddenthings, that Thou make this young man's life the work of myhands!" And he ceased not to nurse him for three days, giving himto drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rosewater; and doing him all manner of service and kindness, tillhealth began to return to his body and Zau al-Makan opened hiseyes.  Presently came in the Fireman and, seeing him sitting upand showing signs of amendment, said to him, "What is now thystate, O my son?" "Praise be to Allah," replied Zau al-Makan, "Iam well and like to recover, if such be the will of AllahAlmighty at this time." The Stoker praised the Lord of All forthis and, wending fast to the market, bought ten chickens, whichhe carried to his wife and said, "Kill two of these for him everyday, one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day." So sherose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled, and fedhim with the flesh and made him drink its broth.  When he haddone eating, she fetched hot water and he washed his hands andlay back upon the pillow, whereupon she covered him up with thecoverlet, and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer. Then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it; after whichshe cut it up and, bringing it to Zau al-Makan, said, "Eat, O myson!" While he was eating; behold, her husband entered and seeingher feeding him, sat down at his head and said to him, "How is itwith thee now, O my son?" "Thanks be to Allah for recovery!" hereplied: "may the Almighty requite thee thy kindness to me." Atthis the Fireman rejoiced and going out, bought sherbet ofviolets and rose water and made him drink it.  Now the Stokerused to work at the Hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams,whereof he spent every day, for Zau al-Makan, one dirham uponsugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower water,[FN#236]and another dirham for fowls; and he ceased not to entreat himthus kindly during a whole month, till the traces of illnessceased from him and he was once more sound and whole.  Thereuponthe Fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him, "O my son, wiltthou go with me to the bath?"; whereto he answered, "Yes!" So theStoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy, and he mountedZau al-Makan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till theycame to the bath.  Then he made him sit down and seated thedonkey boy in the furnace-room and went forth to the market andbought Iote leaves and lupin-flour,[FN#237] with which hereturned to the bath and said to Zau al-Makan, "O my master, inAllah's name, walk in and I will wash thy body." So they enteredthe inner room of the bath, and the Fireman took to rubbing Zaual-Makan's legs and began to wash his body with the leaves andmeal, when there came to them a bathman, whom the bath keeper hadsent to Zau al-Makan; and he, seeing the Stoker washing andrubbing him, said, "This is doing injury to the keeper's rights."Replied the Fireman, "The master overwhelmeth us with hisfavours!" Then the bathman proceeded to shave Zau al-Makan'shead, after which he and the Stoker washed themselves andreturned to the house, where he clad Zau al-Makan in a shirt offine stuff and a robe of his own; and gave him a handsome turbandand girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck. Meanwhile the Fireman's wife had killed and cooked two chickens;so, as soon as Zau al-Makan entered and seated himself on thecarpet, the husband arose and, dissolving sugar in willow flowerwater, made him drink of it.  Then he brought the food tray and,cutting up the chickens, fed him with the flesh and gave him thebroth to drink till he was satisfied; when he washed his handsand praised Allah for recovery, and said to the Fireman, "Thouart he whom the Almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause ofmy cure!" "Leave this talk," replied the other, "and tell us thecause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art.  Thy faceshoweth signs of gentle breeding." "Tell me first how thou camestto fall in with me," said Zau al-Makan; "and after I will tellthee my story." Rejoined the Fireman, "As for that, I found theelying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house, as Iwent to my work near the morning, and knew not who had thrownthee there.  So I carried thee home with me; and this is all mytale." Quoth Zau al-Makan, "Glory to Him who quickeneth thebones, though they be rotten!  Indeed, O my brother, thou hastnot done good save to one worthy of it, and thou shalt presentlygather its fruitage." And he added, "But where am I now?" "Thouart in the city of Jerusalem," replied the Stoker; where upon Zaual-Makan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered hisseparation from his sister and wept.  Then he discovered hissecret to the Fireman and told him his story and began repeating,"In love they bore me further than my force would go, * And for     them made me suffer resurrection throe:Oh, have compassion, cruel!  on this soul of mine * Which, since     ye fared, is pitied by each envious foe;Nor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance * My case to     lighten, easing this excess of woe:Quoth I 'Heart, bear this loss in patience!' Patience cried *     'Take heed! no patience in such plight I'm wont to show.' "Then he redoubled his weeping, and the Fireman said to him, "Weepnot, but rather praise Allah for safety and recovery." Asked Zaual-Makan, "How far is it hence to Damascus?" Answered the other,"Six days' journey." Then quoth Zau al-Makan, "Wilt thou send methither?" "O my lord," quoth the Stoker, "how can I allow thee togo alone, and thou a youth and a stranger to boot?  If thou wouldjourney to Damascus, I am one who will go with thee; and if mywife will listen to and obey me and accompany me, I will take upmy abode there; for it is no light matter to part with thee."Then said he to his wife, "Wilt thou travel with me to Damascusof Syria or wilt thou abide here, whilst I lead this my lordthither and return to thee?  For he is bent upon going toDamascus of Syria and, by Allah, it is hard to me to part withhim, and I fear for him from highway men." Replied she, "I willgo with you both;" and he rejoined, "Praised be Allah for accord,and we have said the last word!" Then he rose and selling all hisown goods and his wife's gear,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawnof day and ceased saying her permitted say,               When it was the Fifty-fifth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fireman and his wife agreed with Zau al-Makan to travel with himDamascus wards.  Then the Stoker sold his goods and his wife'sgear and bought a camel and hired an ass for Zau al-Makan; andthey set out, and ceased not wayfaring for six days till theyreached Damascus.  And they arrived there towards eventide; whenthe Fireman went forth and, as was his wont, bought some meat anddrink.  They had dwelt but five days in Damascus, when his wifesickened and, after a short illness, was translated to the mercyof Almighty Allah.  Her death was a heavy matter to Zau al-Makan,for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously;and the Fireman grieved for her with excessive grief.  Presentlythe Prince turned to the Stoker and finding him mourning, said tohim, "Grieve not, for at this gate we must all go in." Repliedhe, "Allah make weal thy lot, O my son!  Surely He willcompensate us with His favours and cause our mourning to cease. What sayst thou, O my son, about our walking abroad to viewDamascus and cheer thy spirits?" Replied Zau al-Makan, "Thy willis mine." So the Fireman arose and placed his hand in that of Zaual- Makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables ofthe Viceroy of Damascus, where they found camels laden withchests and carpets and brocaded stuffs, and horses ready saddledand Bactrian dromedaries, while Mamelukes and negro slaves andfolk in a hubbub were running to and fro.  Quoth Zau al-Makan, "Iwonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs!"So he asked one of the eunuchs, "Whither this dispatching?'' andhe answered, "These are presents sent by the Emir of Damascus toKing Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with the tribute of Syria." Now whenZau al-Makan heard his father's name his eyes brimmed over withtears, and he began repeating,"Oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne, * Ye whose sight     in my spirit shall ever dwell!Your charms are gone, but this heart of me * Hath no sweet, and     no pleasures its sour dispel;If Allah's grace make us meet again, * In long drawn love-tale my     love I'll tell."And when he had ended his verse, he wept and the Fireman said tohim, "O my son, we hardly believed that thy health hadreturned;[FN#238] so take heart and do not weep, for I fear arelapse for thee." And he ceased not comforting and cheering him,whilst Zau al-Makan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood andseparation from his sister and his family; and tears streamedfrom his eyes and he recited these couplets,"Get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way, *     And know how surely Death descends thy life lot to waylay:All thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine; * All     thy worldly life is vexing, of thy soul in vain display:Say is not worldly wone like a wanderer's place of rest, * Where     at night he 'nakhs'[FN#239] his camels and moves off at dawn     of day?"And he continued to weep and wail over his separation; whilst theFireman also bewept the loss of his wife, yet ceased not tocomfort Zau al-Makan till morning dawned.  When the sun rose, hesaid to him, "Meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land?""Yes," replied Zau al-Makan, "and I can no longer tarry here; soI will commend thee to Allah's care and set out with these folkand journey with them, little by little, till I come to my motherland." Said the Stoker, "And I with thee; for of a truth I cannotbear to part with thee.  I have done thee kindly service and Imean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel." At this, Zaual-Makan rejoiced and said, "Allah abundantly requite thee forme!" and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together. The Fireman at once went forth and bought another ass, sellingthe camel; and laid in his provaunt and said to Zau al-Makan,"This is for thee to ride by the way; and, when thou art weary ofriding, thou canst dismount and walk." Said Zau al-Makan, "MayAllah bless thee and aid me to requite thee!  for verily thouhast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother." Thenhe waited till it was dark night, when he laid the provisions andbaggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey.  This muchbefel Zau al-Makan and the Fireman; but as regards what happenedto his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, when she left her brother in theKhan where they abode and, wrapped in the old camlet, went out toseek service with some one, that she might earn wherewithal tobuy him the roast meat he longed for, she fared on, weeping andknowing not whither to go, whilst her mind was occupied withthoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land. So she implored Allah Almighty to do away with these calamitiesfrom them and began versifying,"Dark falls the night and Passion comes sore pains to gar me     dree, * And pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my     tormentry,And cease not separation flames my vitals to consume, * And     drives me on destruction way this sorrow's ecstacyAnd longing breeds me restlessness; desire for ever fires, * And     tears to all proclaim what I would keep in secrecyNo cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure, * That I may     quit this sickly state, may cure my malady:The love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel, * The     lover from its hell of fire must bear Hell's agony![FN#240]O thou who blamest me for all befel me, 'tis enough, * Patient I     bear what ever wrote the Reed of Doom for me:By Love I swear I'll never be consoled, no, never more; * I swear     the oath of Love's own slaves who know no perjury:O Night, to chroniclers of Love the news of me declare; * That     sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear!"Then she walked on, weeping and turning right and left as shewent, when behold, there espied her an old Badawi[FN#241] who hadcome into the town from the desert with wild Arabs other five. The old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely, but shehad nothing on her head save a piece of camlet, and, marvellingat her beauty, he said to himself, "This charmer dazzleth men'swits but she is in squalid condition, and whether she be of thepeople of this city or she be a stranger, I needs must have her."So he followed her, little by little, till he met her face toface and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane, and calledout to her, asking her case, and said, "Tell me, O my littledaughter!  art thou a free woman or a slave?" When she heardthis, she said to him, "By thy life, do not add to my sorrows!"Quoth he, "Allah hath blessed me with six daughters, of whom fivedied and only one is left me, the youngest of all; and I came toask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger; thatI might take thee and carry thee to her, to bear her company soas to divert her from pining for her sisters.  If thou have nokith and kin, I will make thee as one of them and thou and sheshall be as my two children." Nuzhat al-Zaman bowed her head inbashfulness when she heard what he said and communed withherself, "Haply I may trust myself to this old man." Then shesaid to him, "O nuncle, I am a maiden of the Arabs and a strangerand I have a sick brother; but I will go with thee to thydaughter on one condition, which is, that I may spend only theday with her and at night may return to my brother.  If thoustrike this bargain I will fare with thee, for I am a strangerand I was high in honour among my tribe, and I awoke one morningto find myself vile and abject.  I came with my brother from theland of Al-Hijaz and I fearless he know not where I am." When theBadawi heard this, he said to himself, "By Allah, I have got mydesire!" Then he turned to her and replied, "There shall none bedearer to me than thou; I wish thee only to bear my daughtercompany by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliestnightfall.  Or, if thou wilt, bring him over to dwell with us."And the Badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her, tillshe trusted in him and agreed to serve him.  Then he walked onbefore her and, when she followed him, he winked to his men to goin advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with theirpacks and place upon them water and provisions, ready for settingout as soon as he should come up with the camels.  Now thisBadawi was a base born churl, a highway thief and a traitor tothe friend he held most fief, a rogue in grain, past master ofplots and chicane.  He had no daughter and no son and was onlypassing through the town when, by the decree of the Decreer, hefell in with this unhappy one.  And he ceased not to hold her inconverse on the highway till they came without the city ofJerusalem and, when outside, he joined his companions and foundthey had made ready the dromedaries.  So the Badawi mounted acamel, having seated Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him and they rode onall night.  Then she knew that the Badawi's proposal was a snareand that he had tricked her; and she continued weeping and cryingout the whole night long, while they journeyed on making for themountains, in fear any should see them.  Now when it was neardawn, they dismounted from their dromedaries and the Badawi cameup to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said to her, "O city strumpet, what isthis weeping?  By Allah, an thou hold not thy peace, I will beatthee to death, O thou town filth!" When she heard this sheloathed life and longed for death; so she turned to him and said,"O accursed old man, O gray beard of hell, how have I trustedthee and thou hast played me false, and now thou wouldst tortureme?" When he heard her reply he cried out, "O lazy baggage, dostthou dare to bandy words with me?" And he stood up to her andbeat her with a whip, saying, "An thou hold not thy peace, I willkill thee!" So she was silent awhile, then she called to mind herbrother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tearssecretly.  Next day, she turned to the Badawi and said to him,"How couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these baldand stony mountains, and what is thy design with me?" When heheard her words he hardened his heart and said to her, "O lazybaggage of ill omen and insolent!  wilt thou bandy words withme?" and he took the whip and came down with it on her back tillshe felt faint.  Then she bowed down over his feet andkissed[FN#242] them; and he left beating her and began revilingher and said, "By the rights of my bonnet,[FN#243] if I see orhear thee weeping, I will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thycoynte, O thou city filth!" So she was silent and made him noreply, for the beating pained her; but sat down with her armsround her knees and, bowing her head upon her collar, began tolook into her case and her abasement after her lot of highhonour; and the beating she had endured; and she called to mindher brother and his sickness and forlorn condition, and how theywere both strangers in a far country, which crave her tears downher cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating,"Time hath for his wont to upraise and debase, * Nor is lasting     condition for human race:In this world each thing hath appointed turn; * Nor may man     transgress his determined place:How long these perils and woes?  Ah woe * For a life, all woeful     in parlous case!Allah bless not the days which have laid me low * I' the world,     with disgrace after so much grace!My wish is baffled, my hopes cast down, * And distance forbids me     to greet his face:O thou who passeth that dear one's door, * Say for me, these     tears shall flow evermore!"When she had finished her verses, the Badawi came up to her and,taking compassion on her, bespoke her kindly and wiped away hertears.  Then he gave her a barley scone and said, "I love not onewho answereth at times when I am in wrath: so henceforth give meno more of these impertinent words and I will sell thee to a goodman like myself, who will do well with thee, even as I havedone." "Yes; whatso thou doest is right," answered she; and whenthe night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her, she atevery little of that barley bread.  In the middle of the night theBadawi gave orders for departure,--And Shahrazad perceived thedawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.               When it was the Fifty-sixth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theBadawi gave the barley scone to Nuzhat al-Zaman and promised hewould sell her to a good man like himself, she replied, "Whatsothou doest is right!" and, about midnight when hunger burnedher,[FN#244] she ate a very little of that barley bread and theBadawi ordered his party to set out; so they loaded their loadsand he mounted a camel setting Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him.  Thenthey journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days, tillthey entered the city of Damascus and alighted at the Sultan'sKhan, hard by the Viceroy's Gate.  Now she had lost her colour bygrief and the fatigue of such travelling, and she ceased not toweep over her misfortunes.  So the Badawi came up to her andsaid, "O thou city filth, by the right of my bonnet, if thouleave not this weeping, I will sell thee to none but a Jew!" Thenhe arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber,and walked off to the bazar, and he went round to, the merchantswho dealt in slave girls, and began to parley with them, saying,"I have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill, and I senthim to my people about Jerusalem, that they might tend him tillhe is cured.  As for her I want to sell her, but after the dogher brother fell sick, the separation from him was grievous toher, and since then she doth nothing but weep, and now I wishthat whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her andsay, 'Thy brother is with me in Jerusalem ill'; and I will beeasy with him about her price." Then one of the merchants came upto him and asked, "How old is she?" He answered "She is a virgin,just come to marriageable age, and she is endowed with sense andbreeding and wit and beauty and loveliness.  But from the day Isent her brother to Jerusalem, her heart hath been yearning forhim, so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened."Now when the merchant heard this, he set forth with the Badawiand said, "O Shaykh[FN#245] of the Arabs, I will go with thee andbuy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit andmanners and beauty and loveliness; and I will pay thee her pricebut it must be upon conditions which if thou accept, I will givethee ready money, and if thou accept not I will return her tothee." Quoth the Badawi, "An thou wilt, take her up to the SultanSharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman lord of Baghdad and of theland of Khorasan, and condition me any conditions thou likest,for when thou hast brought her before King Sharrkan, haply shewill please him, and he will pay thee her price and a good profitfor thyself to boot." Rejoined the merchant, "It happens that Ihave just now something to ask from him, and it is this that hewrite me an order upon the office, exempting me from custom duesand also that he write me a letter of recommendation to hisfather, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman.  So if he take the girl, I willweigh[FN#246] thee out her price at once." "I agree with thee tothis condition," answered the Badawi.  So they returned togetherto the place where Nuzhat al-Zaman was and the wild Arab stood atthe chamber door and called out, saying, "O Najiyah[FN#247]!"which was the name wherewith he had named her.  When she heardhim, she wept and made no answer.  Then he turned to the merchantand said to him, "There she sitteth; go to her and look at herand speak to her kindly as I enjoined thee." So the trader wentup to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrousbeautiful and loveable, especially as she knew the Arabic tongue;and he said to the Badawi, "If she be even as thou saddest, Ishall get of the Sultan what I will for her." Then he bespakeher, "Peace be on thee, my little maid!  How art thou?" Sheturned to him and replied, "This also was registered in the Bookof Destiny." Then she looked at him and, seeing him to be a manof respectable semblance with a handsome face, she said toherself, "I believe this one cometh to buy me;" and shecontinued, "If I hold aloof from him, I shall abide with mytyrant and he will do me to death with beating.  In any case,this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for bettertreatment from him than from my brute of a Badawi.  May be hecometh only to hear me talk; so I will give him a fair answer."All this while her eyes were fixed on the ground; then she raisedthem to him and said in a sweet voice, "And upon thee be peace, Omy lord, and Allah's mercy and His benediction![FN#248] This iswhat is commanded of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and preserve! As for thine enquiry how I am, if thou wouldst know my case, itis such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe." And she heldher peace.  When the merchant heard what she said, his fancy tookwings for delight in her and, turning to the Badawi, he askedhim, "What is her price, for indeed she is noble?" Thereupon theBadawi waxed angry and answered, "Thou wilt turn me the girl'shead with this talk!  Why dost thou say that she isnoble,[FN#249] while she is of the scum of slave girls and of therefuse of folk?  I will not sell her to thee!" When the merchantheard this, he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him,"Calm thyself, for I will buy her of thee with these blemishesthou mentionest." "And how much wilt thou give me for her?"enquired the Badawi.  Replied the merchant, "Name thy price forher: none should name the son save his sire." Rejoined theBadawi, "None shall name it but thou thyself." Quoth the merchantto himself, "This wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head.  ByAllah, I cannot tell her price, for she hath won my heart withher fair speech and good looks; and, if she can read and write,it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser.  Butthis Badawi does not know her worth." Then he turned and said tohim, "O Shaykh of the Arabs, I will give thee in ready money,clear of the tax and the Sultan's dues, two hundred gold pieces."Now when the Badawi heard this, he flew into a violent rage andcried at the merchant, saying, "Get up and go thy ways!  ByAllah, wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit ofcamlet she weareth, I would not sell it to thee.  And now I willnot sell her, but will keep her by me, to pasture the camels andgrind my grist." And he cried out to her, saying, "Come here,thou stinkard!  I will not sell thee." Then he turned to themerchant and said to him, "I used to think thee a man ofjudgment; but, by the right of my bonnet, if thou begone not fromme, I will let thee hear what shall not please thee!" Quoth themerchant to himself, "Of a truth this Badawi is mad and knowethnot her value, and I will say no more to him about her price atthe present time; for by Allah, were he a man of sense, he wouldnot say, 'By the rights of my bonnet!' By the Almighty, she isworth the kingdom of the Chosroes and I have not her price by me,but if he ask even more, I will give him what he will, though itbe all my goods." Then he turned and said to him, "O Shaykh ofthe Arabs, take patience and calm thyself and tell me whatclothes she hath with thee?" Cried the Badawi, "And what hath thebaggage to do with clothes?  By Allah, this camlet in which sheis wrapped is ample for her." "With thy leave," said themerchant, "I will unveil her face and examine her even as folkexamine slave girls whom they think of buying."[FN#250]  Repliedthe other, "Up and do what thou wilt and Allah keep thy youth! Examine her outside and inside and, if thou wilt, strip off herclothes and look at her when she is naked." Quoth the trader,"Allah forfend!  I will look at naught save her face."[FN#251] Then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty andloveliness,--And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceasedto say her permitted say.              When it was the Fifty-seventh Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that themerchant went up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and was put to shame by herbeauty and loveliness, so he sat by her side and asked her, "O mymistress, what is thy name?" She answered, "Doss thou ask what ismy name this day or what it was before this day?" Thereupon themerchant enquired, "Hast thou then two names: to day's andyesterday's?" "Yes," replied she, "my name in the past was Nuzhatal-Zaman, the Delight of the Age; but my name at this present isGhussat[FN#252] al-Zaman, the Despight of the Age." When themerchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth heto her, "Hast thou not a sick brother?" "Ay by Allah, O my lord,I have," quoth she, "but fortune hath parted me and him and helieth sick in Jerusalem." The merchant's head was confounded atthe sweetness of her speech and he said to himself, "Verily, theBadawi spake the truth of her." Then she called to mind herbrother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separationfrom him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what hadbefallen him; and she thought of all that had happened to herwith the Badawi and of her severance from her mother and fatherand native land; and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fastas they started they dropped; and she began reciting,"Allah, where'er thou be, His aid impart * To thee, who distant     dwellest in my heart!Allah be near thee how so far thou fare; * Ward off all shifts of     Time, all dangers thwart!Mine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight, * And start my     tears-ah me, how fast they start!Would Heaven I kenned what quarter or what land * Homes thee, and     in what house and tribe thou artAn fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose, * While drink I     tear drops for my sole desert?An thou 'joy slumber in those hours, when I * Peel 'twixt my side     and couch coals' burning smart?All things were easy save to part from thee, * For my sad heart     this grief is hard to dree."When the merchant heard her verses, he wept and put out his handto wipe away the tears from her cheeks; but she let down her veilover her face, saying, "Heaven forbid, O my lord!''[FN#253]  Thenthe Badawi, who was sitting at a little distance watching them,saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe thetears from her cheeks; and he concluded that she would havehindered him from handling her: so he rose and running to her,dealt her, with a camel's halter he had in his hand, such a blowon the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face.  Hereyebrow struck a stone which cut it open, and the blood streameddown her cheeks; whereupon she screamed a loud scream and feltfaint and wept bitterly.  The merchant was moved to tears for herand said in himself, "There is no help for it but that I buy thisdamsel, though at her weight in gold, and free her from thistyrant." And he began to revile the Badawi whilst Nazhat al-Zaman lay in sensible.  When she came to herself, she wiped awaythe tears and blood from her face; and she bound up her head:then, raising her glance to heaven, she besought her Lord with asorrowful heart and began repeating,"And pity one who erst in honour throve, * And now is fallen into     sore disgrace.She weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears, * And asks     'What cure can meet this fatal case?'"When she had ended her verse, she turned to the merchant and saidin an undertone, "By the Almighty, do not leave me with a tyrantwho knoweth not Allah the Most High!  If I pass this night in hisplace, I shall kill myself with my own hand: save me from him, soAllah save thee from Gehenna-fire." Then quoth the merchant tothe Badawi, "O Shaykh of the Arabs, this slave is none of thineaffair; so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt." "Takeher," quoth the Badawi, "and pay me down her price, or I willcarry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camelsand gather their dung."[FN#254]  Said the merchant, "I will givethee fifty thousand diners for her." "Allah will open!"[FN#255]replied the Badawi.  "Seventy thousand," said the merchant. "Allah will open!" repeated the Badawi: "this is not the capitalspent upon her, for she hath eaten with me barley bread to thevalue of ninety thousand gold pieces." The merchant rejoined,"Thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your liveshave not eaten a thousand ducats' worth of barley; but I will saythee one word, wherewith if thou be not satisfied, I will set theViceroy of Damascus on thee and he will take her from thee byforce." The Badawi continued, "Say on!" "An hundred thousand,"quoth the merchant.  "I have sold her to thee at that price,"answered the Badawi; "I shall be able to buy salt with her." Themerchant laughed and, going to his lodgings, brought the moneyand put it into the hand of the Badawi, who took it and made off,saying to himself, "Needs must I go to Jerusalem where, haply, Ishall happen on her brother, and I will bring him here and sellhim also." So he mounted and journeyed till he arrived atJerusalem, where he went to the Khan and asked for Zau al-Makan,but could not find him.  Such was the case with him; but for whatregards the merchant and Nazhat al-Zaman, when he took her hethrew some of his clothes over her and carried her to hislodgings,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceasedsaying her permitted say.              When it was the Fifty-eighth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when thetrader saved Nuzhat al-Zaman from the Badawi and bore her to hislodgings and robed her in the richest raiment, he went down withher to the bazar, where he bought her what ornaments she choseand put them in a satin bag, which he set before her, saying,"All is for thee and I ask nothing of thee in return but that,when I lead thee to the Sultan, Viceroy of Damascus, thouacquaint him with the price I paid for thee, albeit it was littlecompared with thy value: and, if seeing thee he buy thee of me,thou tell him how I have dealt with thee and ask of him for me aroyal patent, and a written recommendation wherewith I can repairto his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad, to theintent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goodsin which I traffic." When she heard his words, she wept andsobbed, and the merchant said to her, "O my lady, I observe that,every time I mention Baghdad, thine eyes are tearful: is thereany one there whom thou lovest?  If it be a trader or the like,tell me; for I know all the merchants and so forth there and, ifthou wouldst send him a message, I will bear it for thee."Replied she, "By Allah, I have no acquaintance among merchantfolk and the like!  I know none there but King Omar bin Nu'uman,Lord of Baghdad." When the merchant heard her words, he laughedand rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself, "By Allah, Ihave won my wish!" Then he said to her, "Hast thou been shown tohim in time past?" She answered, "No, but I was brought up withhis daughter and he holdeth me dear and I have high honour withhim; so if thou wouldst have the King grant thee thy desire, giveme ink case and paper and I will write thee a letter; and whenthou reachest the city of Baghdad, do thou deliver it into thehand of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and say to him, 'Thy handmaid,Nuzhat al-Zaman, would have thee to know that the chances andchanges of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer,and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place toplace, and she sendeth thee her salams.' And, if he ask furtherof her, say that I am now with the Viceroy at Damascus." Themerchant wondered at her eloquence, and his affection for herincreased and he said to her I cannot but think that men haveplayed upon thine understanding and sold thee for money.  Tellme, dost thou know the Koran by heart?" "Yes," answered she; "andI am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and theprolegomena of science and the commentaries of Galen, thephysician, on the canons of Hippocrates; and I have commented himand I have read the Tazkirah and have commented the Burhan; and Ihave studied the Simples of Ibn Baytar, and I have something tosay of the canon of Meccah, by Avicenna.  I can ree riddles andcan solve ambiguities, and discourse upon geometry and am skilledin anatomy I have read the books of the Shafi'i[FN#256] schooland the Traditions of the Prophet and syntax; and I can arguewith the Olema and discourse of all manner learning.  Moreover Iam skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making oftalismans and almanacs, and I know thoroughly the SpiritualSciences[FN#257] and the times appointed for religious duties andI understand all these branches of knowledge."  Then quoth she tothe merchant, "Bring me ink case and paper, that I write thee aletter which shall aid thee on thy journey to Baghdad and enablethee to do without passports." Now when the merchant heard this,he cried out "Brava!  Brava![FN#258] Then O happy he in whosepalace thou shalt!  Thereupon he brought her paper and ink caseand a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do herhonour.  She took a sheet and handled the reed and wrotetherewith these verses,"I see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown; * Say, did     thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone?What makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart?  * Hath     every lover strength such memories to own?How sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day; *     'Tis gone and ere I taste its sweets afar 'tis flown:I pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news * From thee,     to lover wightwi' love so woe begoneComplains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn, * For parting     pangs can break not only heart but stone."And when she had ended writing the verses she continued, "Thesewords are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her andthat watching wasteth her; in the murk of whose night is found nolight and darkness and day are the same in her sight.  Shetosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackenedwith the pencils of sleeplessness; she watcheth the stars ariseand into the gloom she strains her eyes: verily, sadness andleanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of hercase would run to length.  No helper hath she but tears and shereciteth these verses,'No ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light, * But     shakes my very frame with sorrow's killing might:No lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart * To meet his     mate, but breeds in me redoubled blightI bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me, * Ah me, how Love     can part man's mortal frame and sprite!' "Then her eyes welled over with tears, and she wrote also thesetwo couplets,"Love smote my frame so sore on parting day, * That severance     severed sleep and eyes for aye.I waxt so lean that I am still a man, * But for my speaking, thou     wouldst never say."Then she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet, "Thiscometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land, thesorrowful hearted woman Nuzhat al-Zaman." In fine, she folded thesheet and gave it to the merchant, who took it and kissed it andunderstood its contents and exclaimed, "Glory to Him whofashioned thee!"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased saying her permitted say.               When it was the Fifty-ninth Night,She said, It reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zamanwrote the letter and gave it to the merchant; and he took it andread it and understood the contents and exclaimed, "Glory to Himwho fashioned thee!"  Then he redoubled his kindness and madehimself pleasant to her all that day, and when night came hesallied out to the bazar and bought some food, wherewith he fedher; after which he carried her to the Hammam and said to thebath woman, "As soon as thou hast made an end of washing herhead, dress her and send and let me know of it." And she replied"Hearing is obeying." Meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and waxcandles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath;and when the tire woman had done washing her, she dressed her andled her out of the bath and seated her on the bench.  Then shesent to tell the merchant, and Nuzhat al-Zaman went forth to theouter room, where she found the tray spread with food and fruit. So she ate and the tire woman with her, and gave the rest to thepeople and keeper of the bath.  Then she slept till the morning,and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her.  Whenhe aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her,presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchiefworth a thousand diners, a suit of Turkish embroidery and walkingboots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems. Moreover, he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with afine pearl therein, worth a thousand diners, and threw round herneck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amberbeads that hung down between her breasts over her navel.  Now tothis chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents, and eachcrescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby, and each ball a bezelof balass: the value of the chain was three thousand diners andeach of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams, so thatthe dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money.  Whenshe had put these on, the merchant bade her adorn herself, andshe adorned herself to the utmost beauty; then she let fall herfillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchantpreceding her.  But when folk saw her, all wondered at her beautyand exclaimed, "Blessed be Allah, the most excellent Creator!  Olucky the man in whose house the hall be!" And the trader ceasednot walking (and she behind him) till they entered the palace ofSultan Sharrkan; when he sought an audience and, kissing theearth between his hands, said, "O auspicious King, I have broughtthee a rare gift, unmatched in this time and richly gifted withbeauty and with good qualities." Quoth the King, "Let me see it."So the merchant went out and brought her, she following him tillhe made her stand before King Sharrkan.  When he beheld her,blood yearned to blood, though she had been parted from him inchildhood and though he had never seen her, having only heard along time after her birth that he had a sister called Nuzhat al-Zaman and a brother Zau al-Makan, he having been jealous of them,because of the succession.  And such was the cause of his knowinglittle about them.  Then, having placed her before the presence,the merchant said, "O King of the age, besides being peerless inher time and beauty and loveliness, she is also versed in alllearning, sacred and profane, including the art of government andthe abstract sciences." Quoth the King to the trader, "Take herprice, according as thou boughtest her, and go thy ways." "I hearand I obey," replied the merchant; "but first write me a patent,exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise." Saidthe King, "I will do this, but first tell me what price thoupaidest for her." Said the merchant, "I bought her for an hundredthousand diners, and her clothes cost me another hundredthousand." When the Sultan heard these words, he declared, "Iwill give thee a higher price than this for her;" and, callinghis treasurer, said to him, "Pay this merchant three hundred andtwenty thousand ducats; so will he have an hundred and twentythousand diners profit." Thereupon the Sultan summoned the fourKazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said,"I call you to witness that I free this my slave girl and purposeto marry her." So the Kazis wrote out the deed of emancipationand the contract of marriage, when the Sultan scattered much goldon the heads of those present; and the pages and the eunuchspicked up this largesse.  Then, after paying him his monies,Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent,exempting him from toll, tax or tithe upon his merchandise andforbidding each and every in all his government to molest him,and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honour.--AndShahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying herpermitted say.                When it was the Sixtieth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that KingSharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate, after payinghim his monies; and they wrote a perpetual patent, exempting himfrom the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in hisgovernment to molest him; and lastly bestowed upon him a splendiddress of honour.  Then all about him retired, and none remainedsave the Kazis and the merchant, whereupon said he to the judges,"I wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may proveher knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by thistrader, that we ascertain the truth of his assertions." Theyanswered, "There is no evil in that!"; and he commanded thecurtain to be let down between him and those with him and themaiden and those with her; and the women about the damsel behindthe curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet,when they learned that she was become the King's wife.  Then theycame round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weightof her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness. Presently the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs heard that KingSharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty andlearning and philosophy and account keeping, and versed in allbranches of knowledge, that he had paid for her three hundred andtwenty thousand dinars, and that he had set her free and hadwritten a marriage contract with her and had summoned the fourKazis to make trial of her, how she would answer all theirquestions and hold disputetion with them.  So they asked leave oftheir husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was Nuzhat al-Zaman.  When they came in to her, they found the eunuchs standingbefore her; and, as soon as she saw the wives of the Emirs andWazirs and Grandees of the realm coming to call upon her, shearose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy, herhandmaidens standing behind her, and she received them saying,"Ye be welcome!" The while she smiled in their faces so as to wintheir hearts; and she promised them all manner of good and seatedthem in their proper stations, as if she had been brought up withthem; so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said toone another, "This damsel is none other than a Queen, thedaughter of a King." Then they sat down, magnifying her worth andsaid to her, "O our lady, this our city is illumined by thee, andour country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured bythy presence.  The kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palaceis thy palace, and we all are thy handmaids; so, by Allah, do notshut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty." Andshe thanked them for this.  All this while the curtains were letdown between Nuzhat al-Zaman and the women with her, on the oneside, and King Sharrkan and the four Kazis and the merchantseated by him on the other.  Presently King Sharrkan called toher and said, "O Queen, the glory of thine age, this merchanthath described thee as being learned and accomplished; and heclaimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge, evento astrology: so let us hear something of all this he hathmentioned, and favour us with a short discourse on suchsubjects." She replied, saying: "O King, to hear is toobey.[FN#259] The first subjects whereof I will treat are the artof government and the duties of Kings and what behoveth governorsof command meets according to religious law, and what isincumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners. Know then, O King, that all men's works tend either to religiousor to laical life, for none attaineth to religion save throughthis world, because it is the best road to futurity.  Now theworks of this world are not ordered save by the doings of itspeople, and men's doings are divided into four divisions,government, commerce, husbandry and craftsmanship.  Nowgovernment requireth perfect administration with just and truejudgment; for government is the pivot of the edifice of theworld, which world is the road to futurity; since Allah Almightyhath made the world for His servants as viaticum to the travellerfor the attainment of his goal; and it befitteth each man that hereceive of it such measure as shall bring him to Allah, and thathe follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust.  Iffolk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity, allcause of contention would be cut off; but they take thereof withviolence ant after their own desires, and their persistencetherein giveth rise to contentions; so they have need of theSultan, that he do justice between them and order their affairs;and, if the King restrain not his folk from one another, thestrong will drive the weak to the wall.  Hence Ardeshir[FN#260]saith, 'Religion and Kingship be twins'; religion is a hiddentreasure and the King is its keeper; and the Divine Ordinancesand men's intelligence point out that it behoveth the people toadopt a Sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and dothe weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence ofthe proud and the rebels against rule.  For know, O King, thataccording to the measure of the Sultan's good morals, even sowill be the time; as saith the Apostle of Allah (on whom be peaceand salvation!), 'There be two classes who, if they be good, thepeople will be good; and if they be bad, the people will be bad,even the Olema and the Emirs.' And it is said by a certain sage,'There be three kinds of Kings, the King of the Faith, the Kingwho protecteth things to which reverence is due, and the King ofhis own lusts.' The King of the Faith obligeth his subjects tofollow their faith, and it behoveth he be the mostfaithful,[FN#261] for it is by him that they take pattern in thethings of the Faith; and it becometh the folk to obey him inwhatso he commandeth according to Divine Ordinance; but he shallhold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented,because of submission to the decrees of Destiny.  As for the Kingwho protecteth things to be reverenced, he upholdeth the thingsof the Faith and of the World and compelleth his folk to followthe Divine Law and to preserve the rights of humanity; and itfitteth him to unite Pen and Sword; for whoso declineth from whatPen hath written his feet slip and the King shall rectify hiserror with the sharp Sword and dispread his justice over allmankind.  As for the King of his own lusts, he hath no religionbut the following his desire and, as he feareth not the wrath ofhis Lord who set him on the throne, so his Kingdom inclineth todeposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition. And sages say, 'The King hath need of many people, but the peoplehave need of but one King' wherefore it beseemeth that he be wellacquainted with their natures, that he reduce their discord toconcord, that with his justice be encompass them all and with hisbounties overwhelm them all.  And know, O King, that Ardeshir,styled Jamr Shadid, or the Live Coal, third of the Kings ofPersia, conquered the whole world and divided it into fourdivisions and, for this purpose, get for himself four seal rings,one for each division.  The first seal was that of the sea andthe police of prohibition and on it was written, Alterna lives. The second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies,and on it was written, Building up.  The third was the seal ofthe provisioning department and on it was written, Plenty.  Thefourth was the seal of the oppressed, and on it was written,Justice.  And these usages remained valid in Persia until therevelation of Al-Islam.  Chosroes also wrote his son, who waswith the army, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, orthey will be too rich to need thee.'--And Shahrazad perceived thedawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.               When it was the Sixty-first night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Chosroeswrote his son, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, orthey will be too rich to need thee; nor be thou niggardly withthem, or they will murmur against thee.  Give thy givingdeliberately and confer thy favours advisedly; open thy hand tothem in time of success and stint them not in time of distress.'There is a legend that a desert Arab came once to the Caliph Al-Mansur[FN#262] and said, 'Starve thy dog and he shall followthee.' When the Caliph heard his words, he was enraged with theArab, but Abu 'l-Abbas of Tus said to him, 'I fear that if someother than thou should show him a scone, the dog would follow himand leave thee alone.' Thereupon the Caliph Al-Mansur's wrathsubsided and he knew that the wild Arab had intended no offenceand ordered him a present.  And know, O King, that Abd al-Malikbin Marwan wrote to his brother Abd al-Aziz, when he despatchedhim to Egypt, as follows, 'Pay heed to thy Secretaries and thyChamberlains, for the Secretaries will acquaint thee with estatefished matters and the Chamberlains with matters of officialceremony, whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known tothee.' Omar bin Al-Khattab[FN#263] (whom Allah accept!) whenengaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with fourconditions; the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts,the second that he should not wear fine clothes, the third thathe should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should notput off praying till after the proper period.  It is said thatthere is no wealth more profitable than understanding, and thereis no understanding like common sense and prudence, and there isno prudence like piety; that there is no means of drawing near toGod like good morals, no measure like good breeding, no trafficlike good works and no profit like earning the Divine favour;that there is no temperance like standing within the limits ofthe law, no science like that of meditation, no worship likeobeying the Divine commends, no faith like modesty, nocalculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge.  Soguard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what itcompriseth; and think of death and doom ere it ariseth.  SaithAli (whose face Allah honour!), 'Beware of the wickedness ofwomen and be on thy guard against them: consult them not inaught;[FN#264] but grudge not complaisance to them, lest theygreed for intrigue.' And eke quoth he, 'Whoso leaveth the path ofmoderation his wits become perplexed'; and there be rules forthis which we will mention, if it be Allah's will.  And Omar(whom Allah accept!) saith, 'There are three kinds of women,firstly the true believing, Heaven fearing, love full and fruitfull, who helpeth her mate against fate, not helping fate againsther mate; secondly, she who loveth her children but no more and,lastly, she who is a shackle Allah setteth on the neck of whom Hewill.' Men be also three: the wise when he exerciseth his ownjudgement; the wiser who, when befalleth somewhat whereof heknoweth not the issue, seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth bytheir advice; and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right waynor heeding those who would guide him straight.  Justice isindispensable in all things; even slave girls have need ofjustice; and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live byviolenting mankind, for did they not deal equitably amongthemselves and observe justice in dividing their booty, theirorder would fall to pieces.[FN#265] In short, for the rest, thePrince of noble qualities is Beneficence cum Benevolence; and howexcellent is the saying of the poet,By open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe's command; * Go     and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee.'And quoth another,'In ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect, * And     Truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul:Whoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world's good     word, * On glory's course must ever be the first to gain the     goal.'"And Nazhat al-Zaman discoursed upon the policy of Kings till thebystanders said, "Never have we seen one reason of rule andgovernment like this damsel!  Haply she will let us hear somediscourse upon subject other than this." When she heard theirwords and understood them she said, "As for the chapter of goodbreeding, it is wide of comprehension, being a compend of thingsperfect.  Now it so happened that one day there came to theCaliph Mu'awiyah[FN#266] one of his companions, who mentioned thepeople of Irak and the goodness of their wit; and the Caliph'swife Maysun, mother of Yezid, heard his words.  So, when he wasgone, she said to the Caliph, 'O Prince of the Faithful, I wouldthou let some of the people of Irak come in and talk to thee,that I may hear their discourse.' Therewith Mu'awiyah said to hisattendants, 'See who is at the door?' And they answered, 'TheBanu Tamim.' 'Let them come in,' said he.  So they came in andwith them Al-Ahnaf son of Kays.[FN#267]  Then quoth Mu'awiyah,'Enter, O Abu Bahr,' and drew a curtain between himself andMaysun, that she might hear what they said without being seenherself; then he said to Al-Ahnaf, 'O Son of the Sea, draw nearand tell me what counsel thou hast for me.' Quoth Al-Ahnaf, 'Partthy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluckthine armpits and shave thy pubes[FN#268] and ever use thetoothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues, and makethe Ghusl or complete ablution on Friday, as an expiation for allbetween the Fridays.'--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of dayand ceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Sixty-second Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ahnaf binKays replied to Al-Mu'awiyah's[FN#269] question, 'And ever usethe toothstick, because therein be two end seventy virtues andmake the complete Friday ablution as an expiation for all betweenthe two Fridays.' Quoth Mu'awiyah, 'What is thy counsel tothyself?' 'To set my feet firmly on the ground, to move themdeliberately and watch over them with mine eyes!' 'How dost thouorder thyself when thou goest in to one not of the nobles of thytribe?' 'I lower mine eyes modestly and I salute first; I avoidwhat concerneth me not and I spare my words!' 'And how when thougoest in to thine equals?' 'I give ear to them when they speakand I do not assail them when they err!'  'When thou goest in tothy chiefs?' 'I salute without making any sign and await thereply: if they bid me draw near, I draw near, and if they drawoff from me I withdraw!' 'How dost thou with thy wife?' QuothAhnaf, 'Excuse me from answering this, O Commander of theFaithful!'; but Mu'awiyah cried, 'I conjure thee inform me.' Hesaid, 'I entreat her kindly and show her familiarity and am largein expenditure, for woman was created of a crooked rib.'[FN#270] 'And how dost thou when thou hast a mind to lie with her?' 'I bidher perfume herself and kiss her till she is moved to desire;then, should it be as thou knowest,[FN#271] I throw her on herback.  If the seed abide in her womb I say, 'O Allah make itblessed and let it not be a wastrel, but fashion it into the bestof fashions!'[FN#272]  Then I rise from her to ablution and firstI pour water over my hands and then over my body and lastly, Ipraise Allah for the joy He hath given me.' Said Mu'awiyah, 'Thouhast answered right well and now tell me what be thyrequirements?' Said Ahnaf, 'I would have thee rule thy subjectsin the fear of Allah and do even handed justice between them.'Thereupon Ahnaf rose to his feet and left the Caliph's presence,and when he had gone Maysun said, 'Were there but this man inIrak, he would suffice to it.' Then continued Nuzhat al-Zaman,"And all this is a section of the chapter of good breeding, andknow O King, that Muaykib was intendant of the public treasuryduring the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattab,"--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.               When it was the Sixty-third Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman continued, "Know, O King, that Mu'aykib was intendant ofthe public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattab;and it so befel him that he saw Omar's son and gave him a dirhamout of the treasury.  Thereupon, quoth Mu'aykib, 'I returned tomy own house, and while I was sitting there behold, a messengercame to me from Omar and I was afraid and went to him, and when Icame into his presence, in his hand was the dirham I had givenhis son.  He said to me, 'Woe to thee Mu'aykib!  I have foundsomewhat concerning thy soul.' I asked 'And what is that?'; andhe answered, 'It is that thou hast shown thyself a foe to thefollowers of Mohammed (on whom be peace and salvation!) in thematter of this dirham, and thou wilt have to account for it onResurrection Day.'[FN#273] And Omar also wrote a letter to AbuMusa al-Ashari[FN#274] as follows, 'When these presents reachthee, give the people what is theirs and remit to me the rest.'And he did so.  Now when Othman succeeded to the Caliphate, hewrote a like letter to Abu Musa, who did his bidding and sent himthe tribute accordingly, and with it came Ziyad.[FN#275]  Andwhen Ziyad laid the tribute before Othman, the Caliph's son camein and took a dirham, whereupon Ziyad shed tears.  Othman asked'Why weepest thou?'; and Ziyad answered, 'I once brought Omar binal-Khattab the like of this and his son took a dirham, where uponOmar bade snatch it from his hand.  Now thy son hath taken of thetribute, yet I have seen none say aught to him or snatch themoney from him.' Then Othman[FN#276] cried, 'And where wilt thoufind the like of Omar?' Again Zayd bin Aslam relates of hisfather that he said, 'I went out one night with Omar till weapproached a blazing fire.  Quoth Omar, 'O Aslam, I think thesemust be travellers who are suffering from the cold.  Come, let usjoin them.' So we walked on till we came to them and behold!  wefound a woman who had lighted a fire under a cauldron and by herside were two children, both a wailing.  Said Omar, 'Peace bewith you, O folk of light (for it was repugnant to him to say'folk of fire'),[FN#277] what aileth you?' Said she, 'The coldand the night trouble us.' He asked, 'What aileth these littlepeople that they weep?'; and she answered, 'They are hungry.' Heenquired, 'And what is in this cauldron?'; and she replied, 'Itis what I quiet them withal, and Allah will question Omar bin al-Khattab of them, on the Day of Doom.' He said, 'And what shouldOmar know of their case?' 'Why then,' rejoined she, 'should hemanage people's affairs and yet be unmindful of them?' ThereuponOmar turned to me (continned Aslam) and cried, 'Come with us!' Sowe set off running till we reached the pay department of histreasury, where he took out a sack containing flour and a potholding fat and said to me, 'Load these on my back!' Quoth I, 'OCommander of the Faithful, I will carry them for thee.' Herejoined, 'Wilt thou bear my load for me on the Day ofResurrection?' So I put the things on his back, and we set off,running, till we threw down the sack hard by her.  Then he tookout some of the flour and put it in the cauldron; and, saying tothe woman, 'Leave it to me,' he began blowing the fire under thecauldron.  Now he was a long bearded man[FN#278] and I saw thesmoke issuing from between the hairs of his beard till the flourwas cooked, when he took some of the fat and threw it in and saidto the woman, 'Bed them while I cool it for them.' So they fellto eating till they had eaten their fill, and he left the restwith her.  Then he turned to me and said, 'O Aslam, I see it wasindeed hunger made them weep; and I am glad I did not go away ereI found out the cause of the light I saw.'--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the Sixty-fourth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman continued, "It is related that Omar passed by a flock ofsheep, kept by a Mameluke, and asked him to sell him a sheep.  Heanswered, 'They are not mine.' 'Thou art the man I sought,' saidOmar, and bought him and freed him; whereupon the slaveexclaimed, 'O Allah, as thou hast bestowed on me the lesseremancipation; so vouchsafe me the greater!'[FN#279] It is alsosaid that Omar bin al- Khattab was wont to give his servantssweet milk and himself eat coarse fare, and to clothe them softlyand himself wear rough garments.  He rendered unto all men theirdue, and exceeded in his giving to them.  He once gave a man fourthousand dirhams and added thereto a thousand, wherefore it wassaid to him, 'Why dost thou not increase to thy son as thouincreasest to this man?' He answered, 'This man's father stoodfirm at the battle day of Ohod.'[FN#280] Al-Hasan relates thatOmar once came back from foray with much money, and thatHafsah[FN#281] approached him and said, 'O Commander of theFaithful, the due of kinship!' 'O Hafsah!' replied he, 'verilyAllah hath enjoined us to satisfy the dues of kinship, but notwith the monies of the True Believers.  Indeed, thou pleasest"thy family, but thou angerest thy father.' And she went awaytrailing her skirts.[FN#282]  The son of Omar said, 'I imploredthe Lord to show me my father one year after his death, till atlast I saw him wiping the sweat from his brow and asked him, 'Howis it with thee, O my father?' He answered, 'But for my Lord'smercy thy father surely had perished.' Then said Nuzhat al-Zaman,"Hear, O auspicious King, the second division of the firstchapter of the instances of the followers of the Apostle andother holy men.  Saith Al Hasan al-Basri,[FN#283] Not a soul ofthe sons of Adam goeth forth of the world without regrettingthree things,- failure to enjoy what he hath amassed, failure tocompass what he hoped, failure to provide himself with sufficientviaticum for that hereto he goeth.[FN#284] It was said ofSufyan,[FN#285] 'Can a man be a religious and yet possesswealth?' He replied, 'Yes, so he be patient when grieved and bethankful when he hath received.' Abdullah bin Shaddad, beingabout to die, sent for his son Mohammed and admonished him,saying, 'O my son, I see the Summoner of Death summoning me, andso I charge thee to fear Allah both in public and private, topraise Allah and to be soothfastin thy speech, for such praisebringeth increase of prosperity, and piety in itself is the bestof provision for the next world; even as saith one of the poets,'I see not happiness lies in gathering gold; * The man most pious     is man happiest:In truth the fear of God is best of stores, * And God shall make     the pious choicely blest.'Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, "Let the King also give ear to thesenotes from the second section of the first chapter." He asked her'What be they?'; and she answered, "When Omar bin Abd al-Aziz[FN#286] succeeded to the Caliphate, he went to his household andlaying hands on all that was in their hold, put it into thepublic treasury.  So the Banu Umayyah flew for aid to hisfather's sister, Fatimah, daughter of Marwan, and she sent to himsaying, 'I must needs speak to thee.' So she came to him by nightand, when he had made her alight from her beast and sit down, hesaid to her, 'O aunt, it is for thee to speak first, since thouhast some thing to ask: tell me then what thou wouldst with me.'Replied she, 'O Commander of the Faithful, it is thine to speakfirst, for thy judgment perceiveth that which is hidden from theintelligence of others.' Then said Omar, 'Of a verity AllahAlmighty sent Mohammed as a blessing to some and a bane toothers; and He elected for him those with him, and commissionedhim as His Apostle and took him to Himself,'--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.               When it was the Sixty-fifth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman continued thus, "Said Omar, 'Verily Allah commissioned asHis Apostle Mohammed (upon whom be the benediction of Allah andHis salvation!), for a blessing to some and a bane to others; andHe elected for him those with him and took him to Himself,leaving the people a stream whereof they might drink.  After himAbu Bakr[FN#287] the Truth teller became Caliph and he left theriver as it was, doing what was pleasing to Allah.  Then aroseOmar and worked a work and strove in holy war and strife where ofnone might do the like.  But when Othman arose to power hediverted a streamlet from the stream, and Mu'awiyah in his turndiverted from it several streamlets; and without ceasing in likemanner, Yezid and the Banu Marwan such as Abd al-Malik and Walidand Sulayman[FN#288] drew away water from the stream, and themain course dried up, till rule devolved upon me, and now I amminded to restore the stream to its normal condition.' WhenFatimah heard this, she said, 'I came wishing only to speak andconfer with thee, but if this be thy word, I have nothing to sayto thee.' Then she returned to the Ommiades and said to them,'Now take ye the consequences of your act when ye alliedyourselves by marriage with Omar bin al-Khattab.'[FN#289]  And itis also said that when Omar was about to die, he gathered hischildren round him, and Maslamah[FN#290] bin Abd al-Malik said tohim, 'O Prince of the Faithful, how wilt thou leave thy childrenpaupers and thou their protector?  None can hinder thee in thylifetime from giving them what will suffice them out of thetreasury; and this indeed were better than leaving the good workto him who shall rule after thee.' Omar looked at him with a lookof wrath and wonder and presently replied, 'O Maslamah, I havedefended them from this sin all the days of my life, and shall Imake them miserable after my death?  Of a truth my sons are likeother men, either obedient to Almighty Allah who will prosperthem, or disobedient and I will not help them in theirdisobedience.  Know, O Maslamah, that I was present, even asthou, when such an one of the sons of Marwanwas buried, and Ifell asleep by him and saw him in a dream given over to one ofthe punishments of Allah, to whom belong Honour and Glory!  Thisterrified me and made me tremble, and I vowed to Allah, that ifever I came to power, I would not do such deeds as the dead manhad done.  I have striven to fulfil this vow all the length of mylife and I hope to die in the mercy of my Lord.' Quoth Maslamah,'A certain man died and I was present at his burial, and when allwas over I fell asleep and I saw him as a sleeper seeth a dream,walking in a garden of flowing waters clad in white clothes.  Hecame up to me and said: 'O Maslamah, it is for the like of thisthat rulers should rule.' Many are the instances of this kind,and quoth one of the men of authority, 'I used to milk the ewesin the Caliphate of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz, and one day I met ashepherd, among whose sheep I saw a wolf or wolves.  I thoughtthem to be dogs, for I had never before seen wolves; so I asked,'What dost thou with these dogs?' 'They are not dogs, butwolves,' answered the shepherd.  Quoth I, 'Can wolves be withsheep and not hurt them?' Quoth he, 'When the head is whole, thebody is whole.'[FN#291] Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once preached from apulpit of clay and, after praising and glorifying Allah Almighty,said three words as follows, 'O folk, make clean your inmosthearts, that your outward lives may be dean to your brethren, andabstain ye from the things of the world.  Know that between usand Adam there is no one man alive among the dead.  Dead are Abdal- Malik and those who forewent him, and Omar also shall die andthose who forewent him.' Asked Maslamah, 'O Commander of theFaithful, an we set a pillow behind thee, wilt thou lean on it alittle while?' But Omar answered, 'I fear lest it be a faultabout my neck on Resurrection Day.' Then he gasped with the deathrattle and fell back in a faint; whereupon Fatimah cried out,saying, 'Ho, Maryam!  Ho, Muzahim![FN#292] Ho, such an one!  Lookto this man!' And she began to pour water on him weeping, till herevived from his swoon; and, seeing her in tears said to her,'What causeth thee to weep, O Fatimah?' She replied, 'O Commanderof the Faithful, I saw thee lying prostrate before us and thoughtof thy prostration in death before Almighty Allah, of thydeparture from the world and of thy separation from us.  This iswhat made me weep.' Answered he, 'Enough, O Fatimah, for indeedthou exceedest.' Then he would have risen, but fell down andFatimah strained him to her and said, 'Thou art to me as myfather and my mother, O Commander of the Faithful!  We cannotspeak to thee, all of us.' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman to herbrother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, "Here endeth the secondsection of the first chapter."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawnof day and ceased to say her permitted say.               When it was the Sixty-sixth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman said to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, "Hereendeth the second section of the first chapter.  And it sohappened that Omar bin Abd al-Aziz wrote to the people of thefestival at Meccah as follows, 'I call Allah to witness, in theHoly Month, in the Holy City and on the day of the GreaterPilgrimage,[FN#293] that I am innocent of your oppression and ofhis wrongs that doth wrong you, in that I have neither commandedthis nor purposed it, neither hath any report of aught thereofhitherto reached me, nor have I compassed any knowledge thereof;and I trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that nonehath authority from me to oppress any man, for I shall assuredlybe questioned concerning every one oppress.  And if any of myofficers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the HolyBook and the Traditions of the Apostle do authorise, obey him notso that he may return to the way of righteousness.' He said also(Allah accept of him!), 'I do not wish to be relieved from death,because it is the supreme thing for which the True Believer isrewarded.' Quoth one of authority, 'I went to the Prince of theFaithful, Omarbin Abd al-Aziz, who was then Caliph, and sawbefore him twelve dirhams, which he ordered for deposit in thepublic treasury.  So I said to him, 'O Commander of the Faithful,thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggaryhaving nothing whereon to live.  An thou wouldst appoint somewhatby will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thyhouse, it were well.' 'Draw near to me,' answered he: so I drewnear to him and he said, 'Now as for thy saying, 'Thou beggarestthy children; provide for them and for the poor of thyhousehold,' it is without reason; for Allah of a truth willreplace me to my children and to the poor of my house, and Hewill be their guardian.  Verily, they are like other men; he whofeareth Allah, right soon will Allah provide for him a happyissue, and he that is addicted to sins, I will not up hold him inhis sin against Allah.' Then he summoned his sons who numberedtwelve, and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears andpresently he said to them, 'Your Father is between two things;either ye will be well to do, and your parent will enter thefire, or ye will be poor and your parent will enter Paradise; andyour father's entry into Paradise is liefer to him than that yeshould be well to do.[FN#294] So arise and go, Allah be yourhelper, for to Him I commit your affairs!' Khalid binSafwan[FN#295] said, 'Yusuf bin Omar[FN#296] accompanied me toHisham bin Abd al-Malik,[FN#297] and as I met him he was comingforth with his kinsmen and attendants.  He alighted and a tentwas pitched for him.  When the people had taken their seats, Icame up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining andlooked at him; and, waiting till my eyes met his eyes, bespokehim thus, 'May Allah fulfil His bounty to thee, O Commander ofthe Faithful, I have an admonition for thee, which hath come downto us from the history of the Kings preceding thee!'  At this, hesat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me, 'Bring whatthou hast, O son of Safwan!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of theFaithful, one of the Kings before thee went forth in a timebefore this thy time, to this very country and said to hiscompanions, 'Saw ye ever any state like mine and say me, hathsuch case been given to any man even as it hath been given untome?' Now there was with him a man of those who survive to beartestimony to Truth; upholders of the Right and wayfarers in itshighway, and he said to him, 'O King, thou askest of a gravematter.  Wilt thou give me leave to answer?' 'Yes,' replied theKing, and the other said, 'Dost thou judge thy present state tobe short lasting or ever lasting?' 'It is temporary,' replied theKing.  'How then,' rejoined the man, 'do I see thee exulting inthat which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thouwilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering anaccount whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned?' Quoththe King, 'Whither shall I flee and what must I seek for me?''That thou abide in thy kingship,' replied the other, 'or elserobe thee in rags[FN#298] and apply thyself to obey AlmightyAllah thy Lord until thine appointed hour.  I will come to theeagain at daybreak.' Khalid bin Safwan further relates that theman knocked at the door at dawn and behold, the King had put offhis crown and resolved to become an anchorite, for the stress ofhis exhortation.  When Hisham bin Abd al-Malik heard this, hewept till his beard was wet, and, bidding his rich apparel be putoff, shut himself up in his palace.  Then the grandees anddependents came to Khalid and said, 'What is this thou hast donewith the Commander of the Faithful?  Thou hast troubled hispleasure and disturbed his life!' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman,addressing herself to Sharrkan, "How many instances of admonitionare there not in this chapter!  Of a truth I cannot report allappertaining to this head in a single sitting,"--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the Sixty-seventh Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman continued, speaking to Sharrkan, "Know, O King, that inthis chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth Icannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sittingbut, with length of days, O King of the age, all will be well."There said the Kazis, "O King, of a truth this damsel is thewonder of the world, and of our age the unique pearl!  Neverheard we her like in the length of time or in the length of ourlives." And they called down blessings on the King and went away. Then Sharrkan turned to his attendants and said, "Begin ye toprepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds."So they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands, and hecommanded the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees departnot until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling ofthe bride.  Hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when thetables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye candelight in of roast meats and geese and fowls; and the subjectsate till they were satisfied.  Moreover, Sharrkan had sent forall the singing women of Damascus and they were present, togetherwith every slave girl of the King and of the notables who knewhow to sing.  And they went up to the palace in one body.  Whenthe evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles,right and left, from the gate of the citadel to that of thepalace; and the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees marched past beforeKing Sharrkan, whilst the singers and the tire women took thedamsel to dress and adorn her, but found she needed no adornment. Meantime King Sharrkan went to the Hammam and coming out, satdown on his seat of estate, whilst they paraded the bride beforehim in seven different dresses: after which they eased her of theweight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions asare enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights.  Then Sharrkanwent in unto her and took her maidenhead;[FN#299] and she at onceconceived by him and, when she announced it, he rejoiced withexceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of herconception.  On the morrow he went forth and seated himself onhis throne, and the high officers came in to him and gave himjoy.  Then he called his private secretary and bade him write aletter to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, saying that hehad bought him a damsel, who excels in learning and good breedingand who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge.  Moreover hewrote, "There is no help but that I send her to Baghdad to visitmy brother Zau al-Makan and my sister Nuzhat al-Zaman.  I haveset her free and married her and she hath conceived by me." Andhe went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sistertogether with the Wazir Dandan and all the Emirs.  Then he sealedthe letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier whowas absent a whole month, after which time he returned with theanswer and presented it in the presence.  Sharrkan took it andread as follows, "After the usual Bismillah, this is from theafflicted distracted man, from him who hath lost his children andhome by bane and ban, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, to his sonSharrkan.  Know that, since thy departure from me, the place isbecome contracted upon me, so that no longer I have power ofpatience nor can I keep my secret: and the cause thereof is asfollows.  It chanced that when I went forth to hunt and courseZau al-Makan sought my leave to fare Hijaz wards, but I, fearingfor him the shifts of fortune, forbade him therefrom until thenext year or the year after.  My absence while sporting andhunting endured for a whole month"--And Shahrazad perceived thedawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Sixty-eighth night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omarbin al-Nu'uman wrote in his letter, "My absence while sportingand hunting endured for a whole month, and when I returned Ifound that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money andhad set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth. When I knew this, the wide world narrowed on me, O my son!  but Iawaited the return of the caravan, hoping that haply they wouldcome back with it.  Accordingly, when the palmers appeared Iasked concerning the twain, but they could give me no news ofthem; so I donned mourning for them, being heavy at heart, and insleep I have no part and I am drowned in the tears of my eyes."Then he wrote in verse,"That pair in image quits me not one single hour, * Whom in my     heart's most honourable place I keep:Sans hope of their return I would not live one hour, * Without my     dreams of them I ne'er would stretch me in sleep."The letter went on, "And after the usual salutations to thee andthine, I command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of themfor indeed this is a shame to us." When Sharrkan read the letterhe felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brotherand sister.  Then he took the missive and went in with it toNuzhat al-Zaman who knew not that he was her brother, nor he thatshe was his sister, albeit he often visited her both by night andby day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on thestool of delivery.  Allah made the child birth easy to her andshe bare a daughter, whereupon she sent for Sharrkan and seeinghim she said to him, "This is thy daughter: name her as thouwilt." Quoth he, "It is usual to name children on the seventh dayafter birth.[FN#300]" Then he bent over the child to kiss it andhe saw, hung about its neck, a jewel, which he knew at once forone of those which Princess Abrizah had brought from the land ofthe Greeks.  Now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe'sneck he recognised it right well, his senses fled and wrathseized on him; his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at Nuzhatal- Zaman and said to her, "Whence hadst thou this jewel, O slavegirl?" When she heard this from Sharrkan she replied, "I am thylady, and the lady of all in thy palace!  Art thou not ashamed tosay to me Slave girl?  I am a Queen, daughter of King Omar binal-Nu'uman." Hearing this, he was seized with trembling and hunghis head earthwards,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased to say her permitted say.               When it was the Sixty-ninth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that whenSharrkan heard these words, his heart fluttered and his colourwaxed yellow and he was seized with trembling and he hung hishead earthwards, for he knew that she was his sister by the samefather.  Then he lost his senses; and, when he revived, he abodein amazement, but did not discover his identity to her and asked,O my lady, say, art thou in sooth the daughter of King Omar binal- Nu'uman?" "Yes," answered she; and he continued, "Tell me thecause of thy leaving thy sire and of thy being sold for a slave."So she related to him all that had befallen her from beginning toend, how she had left her brother sick in the Sanctified City,Jerusalem, and how the Badawi had kidnapped her and had sold herto the trader.  When Sharrkan heard this, he was certified of herbeing his sister on the sword side and said to himself, "How canI have my sister to wife?  By Allah, needs must I marry her toone of my chamberlains; and, if the thing get wind, I willdeclare that I divorced her before consummation and married herto my Chief Chamberlain." Then he raised his head and sighingsaid, "O Nuzhat al-Zaman, thou art my very sister and I cry: 'Itake refuge with Allah from this sin whereinto we have fallen,'for I am Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman." She looked at himand knew he spoke the truth; and, becoming as one demented, shewept and buffeted her face, exclaiming, "There is no Majesty andthere is no Might save in Allah!  Verily have we fallen intomortal sin![FN#301] What shall I do and what shall I say to myfather and my mother when they ask me, Whence hadst thou thydaughter?" Quoth Sharrkan, "It were meetest that I marry thee tomy Chamberlain and let thee bring up my daughter in his house,that none may know thou be my sister.  This hath befallen us fromAlmighty Allah for a purpose of his own, and nothing shall coverus but thy marriage with this Chamberlain, ere any know." Then hefell to comforting her and kissing her head and she asked him,"What wilt thou call the girl?" "Call her Kuzia Fakan,"[FN#302]answered he.  Then he gave the mother in marriage to the ChiefChamberlain, and transferred her to his house with the child,which they reared on the laps of the slave girls, and fed withmilk and dosed with powders.  Now all this occurred whilst thebrother, Zau al-Makan, still tarried with the Fireman atDamascus.  One day there came to King Sharrkan a courier from hisfather, with a letter which he took and read and found therein,"After the Bismillah know, O beloved King, that I am afflictedwith sore affliction for the loss of my children: sleep everfaileth me and wakefulness ever assaileth me.  I send thee thisletter that, as soon as thou receivest it, thou make ready themonies and the tribute, and send them to us, together with thedamsel whom thou hast bought and taken to wife; for I long to seeher and hear her discourse; more especially because there hathcome to us from Roumland an old woman of saintly bearing and withher be five damsels high bosomed virgins, endowed with knowledgeand good breeding and all arts and sciences befitting mortals toknow; and indeed tongue faileth me to describe this old woman andthese who with her wend; for of a truth they are compendiums ofperfections in learning and accomplishments.  As soon as I sawthem I loved them, and I wished to have them in my palace and inthe compass of my hand; for none of the Kings owneth the like ofthem; so I asked the old woman their price and she answered, 'Iwill not sell them but for the tribute of Damascus.' And I, byAllah, did not hold this price exorbitant, indeed it is butlittle, for each one of them is worth the whole valuation.  So Iagreed to that and took them into my palace, and they remain inmy possession.  Wherefore do thou forward the tribute to us thatthe woman may return to her own country; and send to us thedamsel to the end that she may dispute with them before thedoctors; and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to theeaccompanied by the tribute of Baghdad."--And Shahrazad perceivedthe dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.               When it was the Seventieth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omarson of Al-Nu'uman said in his letter, "And send to us the damselto the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and,if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompaniedwith the tribute of Baghdad." As soon as Sharrkan knew thecontents, he went in to his brother in law and said to him,"Bring the damsel to whom I married thee;" and when she came heshowed her the letter and said, "O my sister!  what answerwouldst thou advise me make to this letter?" Replied she, "Seekadvice from thyself!" and presently added (for she yearned afterher people and her native land), "Send me together with myhusband the Chamberlain, to Baghdad, that I may tell my father mytale and let him know whatso befel me with the Badawi who sold meto the merchant, and that I also inform him how thou boughtest meof the trader and gavest me in marriage to the Chamberlain, aftersetting me free." "Be it so," replied Sharrkan.  Then Sharrkantook his daughter, Kuzia Fakan, and committed her to the chargeof the wet nurses and the eunuchs, and he made ready the tributein haste, bidding the Chamberlain travel with the Princess andthe treasure to Baghdad.  He also furnished him two travellinglitters one for himself and the other for his wife.  And theChamberlain replied, "To hear is to obey." Moreover Sharrkancollected camels and mules and wrote a letter to his father andcommitted it to the Chamberlain; then he bade farewell to hissister, after he had taken the jewel from her and hung it roundhis daughter's neck by a chain of pure gold; and she and herhusband set out for Baghdad the same night.  Now it so happenedthat Zau al-Makan and his friend the Fireman had come forth fromthe hut in which they were, to see the spectacle, and they beheldcamels and Bukhti[FN#303] dromedaries and bat-mules and torchesand lanterns alight; and Zau al-Makan enquired about the loadsand their owner and was told that it was the tribute of Damascusgoing to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of the City of Baghdad. He then asked, "Who be the leader of the caravan?" and theyanswered, "The Head Chamberlain who hath married the damsel sofamous for learning and science." Thereupon Zau al-Makan weptwith bitter weeping and was minded of his mother and his fatherand his sister and his native land, and he said to the Stoker, "Iwill join this caravan and, little by little, will journeyhomewards." Quoth the Fireman, "I would not suffer thee to travelsingle handed from the Holy City to Damascus, then how shall I besure of thy safety when thou farest for Baghdad?  But I will gowith thee and care for thee till thou effectest thine object.""With joy and good will," answered Zau al-Makan.  Then theFireman get him ready for the journey and hired an ass and threwsaddle bags over it and put therein something of provaunt; and,when all was prepared, he awaited the passage of the caravan. And presently the Chamberlain came by on a dromedary and hisfootmen about him.  Then Zau al-Ma ken mounted the ass and saidto his companion, "Do thou mount with me." But he replied, "Notso: I will be thy servant." Quoth Zau al-Makan, "There is no helpfor it but thou ride awhile." "'Tis well," quoth the Stoker; "Iwill ride when I grow tired." Then said Zau al-Makan, "O mybrother, soon shalt thou see how I will deal with thee, when Icome to my own folk." So they fared on till the sun rose and,Whenit was the hour of the noonday sleep[FN#304] the Chamberlaincalled a halt and they alighted and reposed and watered theircamels.  Then he gave the signal for departure and, after fivedays, they came to the city of Hamah,[FN#305] where they set downand made a three days' halt;--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn ofday and ceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Seventy-first Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they haltedin the city of Hamah three days; they then fared forwards andceased not travelling till they reached another city.  Here alsothey halted three days and thence they travelled till theyentered the province Diyar Bakr.  Here blew on them the breezesof Baghdad, and Zau al-Makan bethought him of his father andmother and native land, and how he was returning to his sirewithout his sister: so he wept and sighed and complained, and hisregrets grew on him, and he began improvising these couplets,"Sweetheart!  How long must I await by so long suffering teed? *     Nor cometh messenger to tell me where thou dost abide:Ah me!  in very sooth our meeting time was short enow: * Would     Heaven shorter prove to me the present parting-tide!Now trend my hand and open my robe and thou within shall sight *     How wasted are the limbs of me and yet the waste I hide:When say they 'Comfort take for loss of love' I but reply * 'By     Allah, till the Day of Doom no comfort shall betide!' "Thereupon said to him the Fireman, "Leave this weeping andwailing, for we are near the Chamberlain's tent." Quoth Zau al-Makan, "Needs must I recite somewhat of verse; haply it mayquench the fire of my heart." "Allah upon thee," cried the other,"cease this lamentation till thou come to shine own country; thendo what thou wilt, and I will be with thee wherever thou art."Replied Zau al-Makan, "By Allah!  I cannot forbear from this!"Then he turned his face towards Baghdad and the moon was shiningbrightly and shedding her light on the place, and Nuzhat al-Zamancould not sleep that night, but was restless and called to mindher brother and wept.  And while she was in tears, he heard Zaual-Makan weeping and improvising the following distichs,'Al-Yaman's[FN#306] leven-gleam I see, * And sore despair     despaireth meFor friend who erst abode wi' me * Crowning my cup with gladdest     gree:It minds me o' one who jilted me * To mourn my bitter liberty.Say sooth, thou fair sheet lightning!  shall * We meet once more     in joy and glee?O blamer!  spare to me thy blame * My Lord hath sent this dule to     dree,Of friend who left me, fain to flee; * Of Time that breeds     calamity:All bliss hath fled the heart of me * Since Fortune proved mine     enemy.He[FN#307] brimmed a bowl of merest pine, * And made me drain the     dregs, did he:I see me, sweetheart, dead and gone * Ere I again shall gaze on     thee.Time!  prithee bring our childhood back, * Restore our happy     infancy,When joy and safety 'joyed we * From shafts that now they shoot     at me!Who aids the hapless stranger wight, * That nights in fright and     misery,That wastes his days in lonely grief, * For 'Time's     Delight'[FN#308] no more must be?Doomed us despite our will to bear * The hands of base bores cark     and care."When he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a faintingfit.  This is how it fared with him; but as regards Nuzhat al-Zaman, when she heard that voice in the night, her heart was atrest and she rose and in her joy she called the Chief Eunuch, whosaid to her, "What is thy will?" Quoth she, "Arise and bring mehim who recited verses but now." Replied he, "Of a truth I didnot hear him"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceasedto say her permitted say.             When it was the Seventy-second Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when NuzhatAl-Zaman heard her brother reciting, she called the Chief Eunuchand said to him, "Go, fetch me the man who is repeating thispoetry!" Replied he, "Of a truth I heard him not and I wot himnot and folks are all sleeping." But she said, "Whomsoever thouseest awake, he is the reciter." So he went, yet found none onwake save the Stoker; for Zau al-Makan was still insensible, andwhen his companion saw the Eunuch standing by his head he wasafraid of him.  Then said the Eunuch, "Art thou he who repeatedpoetry but now and my lady heard him?" The Stoker fancied thatthe dame was wroth with the reciter; and, being afraid, hereplied, "By Allah, 'twas not I!" Rejoined the Eunuch, "Who thenwas the reciter?: point him out to me.  Thou must know who itwas, seeing that thou art awake." The Fireman feared for Zau al-Makan and said in himself, "Haply the Eunuch will do him somehurt"; so he answered, "By Allah, I know not who it was." Saidthe Eunuch, "By Allah, thou liest, for there is none on wake herebut thou!  So needs must thou know him." "By Allah," replied theFireman, "I tell thee the truth!: some passer by, some wayfarermust have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake;Allah requite him!" Quoth the Eunuch, "If thou happen upon him,point him out to me and I will lay hands on him and bring him tothe door of our lady's litter[FN#309] or do thou take him withthine own hand." Said the Fireman, "Go thou back and I will bringhim to thee." So the Eunuch left him and went his ways; and,going in to his mistress, told her all this and said to her,"None knoweth who it was; it must have been some passer by, somewayfarer." And she was silent.  Meanwhile, Zau al-Makan came tohimself and saw that the moon had reached the middle Heavens; thebreath of the dawn breeze[FN#310] breathed upon him and his heartwas moved to longing and sadness; so he cleared his throat andwas about to recite verses, when the Fire man asked him, "Whatwilt thou do?" Answered Zau al-Makan, "I have a mind to repeatsomewhat of poetry, that I may quench therewith the fire of myheart." Quoth the other, "Thou knowest not what befel me whilstthou wast a faint, and how I escaped death only by beguiling theEunuch." "Tell me what happened," quoth Zau al-Makan.  Repliedthe Stoker, "Whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but nowan Eunuch, with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand, whotook to looking in all the people's faces, as they lay asleep,and asked me who it was recited the verses, finding none awakebut myself.  I told him in reply it was some passerby, somewayfarer; so he went away and Allah delivered me from him; elsehad he killed me.  But first he said to me, 'If thou hear himagain, bring him to us.'" When Zau al-Makan heard this he weptand said, "Who is it would forbid me to recite?  I will surelyrecite, befal me what may; for I am near mine own land and carefor none." Rejoined the Fireman, "Thy design is naught save tolose thy life;" and Zau al-Makan retorted, "Needs must I reciteverses." "Verily," said the Stoker, "needs must there be aparting between me and thee in this place, albeit;I had intendednot to leave thee, till I had brought thee to thy native city andreunited thee with thy mother and father.  Thou hast now tarriedwith me a year and a half and I have never harmed thee in aught. What ails thee, then, that thou must needs recite verses, seeingthat we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folkare asleep, for they require sleep to rest them of theirfatigue?" But Zau al-Makan answered, "I will not be turned awayfrom my purpose."[FN#311]  Then grief moved him and he threw offconcealment and began repeating these couplets,"Stand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead;     * Cry thou for an answer, belike reply to thee shall be     sped:If the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch * Wi'     repine; and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greed:If the snake of the sand dunes hiss, I shall marvel not at all!      * Let him bite so I bite those beauteous lips of the     luscious red:O Eden, my soul hath fled in despite of the maid I love: * Had I     lost hope of Heaven my heart in despair were dead."And he also improvised the two following distichs,"We were and were the days enthralled to all our wills, *     Dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest site:Who shall restore the home of the beloved, where showed * Light     of the Place for aye conjoined with Time's     Delight?''[FN#312]And as he ceased his verses, he shrieked three shrieks and fellsenseless to the ground and the Fireman rose and covered him. When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard the first improvisation, she called tomind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilomehome; then she wept and cried at the Eunuch and said to him, "Woeto thee!  He who recited the first time hath recited a secondtime and I heard him hard by.  By Allah, an thou fetch him not tome, I will assuredly rouse the Chamberlain on thee, and he shallbeat thee and cast thee out.  But take these hundred diners andgive them to the singer and bring him to me gently, and do him nohurt.  If he refuse, hand to him this purse of a thousand diners,then leave him and return to me and tell me, after thou hastinformed thyself of his place and his calling and what countrymanhe is.  Return quickly and linger not."--And Shahrazad perceivedthe dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Seventy-third Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman sent the Eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer andsaid, "Beware how thou come back to me and report, I could notfind him." So the Eunuch went out and laid about the people andtrod in their tents, but found none awake, all being asleep forweariness, till he came to the Stoker and saw him sitting up,with his head uncovered.  So he drew near and seizing him by thehand, said to him, "It was thou didst recite the verses!" TheFireman was afeard for his life and replied, "No, by Allah, Ochief of the people, it was not I!" But the Eunuch said, "I willnot leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited theverses, for I dread returning to my lady without him." Now whenthe Fireman heard these words he feared for Zau al-Makan and weptwith exceeding weeping and said to the Eunuch, "By Allah, it wasnot I, and I know him not.  I only heard some passer by, somewayfarer, recite verses: so do not thou commit sin on me, for Iam a stranger and come from the Holy City of Jerusalem; andAbraham, the friend of Allah, be with you all." "Rise up and farewith me," rejoined the Eunuch, "and tell my lady this with thineown mouth, for I have seen none awake save thyself." Quoth theStoker, "Hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the placewhere I now am, and dost thou not know my station?  Thou wottestnone can stir from his place, except the watchman seize him.  Sogo thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after thishour reciting aught of poetry, whether he be near or far, it willbe I or some one I know, and thou shalt not learn of him but byme." Then he kissed the Eunuch's head and spake him fair till hewent away; but the Castrato fetched a round and, returningsecretly, came and stood behind the Fireman, fearing to go backto his mistress without tidings.  As soon as he was gone, theStoker arose and aroused Zau al-Makan and said to him, "Come, situp, that I may tell thee what hath happened." So Zau al-Makan satup, and his companion told him what had passed, and he answered,"Let me alone; I will take no heed of this and I care for none,for I am mine own country."[FN#313] Quoth the Stoker, "Why wiltthou obey thy flesh and the devil?  If thou fear no one, I fearfor thee and for my life, so Allah upon thee!  recite nothingmore of verses till thou come to thine own land.  Indeed, I hadnot deemed thee so ill conditioned.  Dost thou not know that thislady is the wife; of the Chamberlain and is minded to chastisethee for disturbing her?  Belike, she is ill or restless forfatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from herhome, and this is the second time she hath sent the Eunuch tolook for thee." However Zau al-Makan paid no heed to theFireman's words but cried out a third time and began versifyingwith these couplets,"I fly the carper's injury,* Whose carping sorely vexeth me:He chides and taunts me, wotting not * He burns me but more     grievously.The blamer cries 'He is consoled!' * I say, 'My own dear     land[FN#314] to see:'They ask, 'Why be that land so dear?' * I say, 'It taught me in     love to be:'They ask, 'What raised its dignity?' * I say, 'What made my     ignomy:'Whate'er the bitter cup I drain, * Far be fro' me that land to     flee:Nor will I bow to those who blame, * And for such love would deal     me shame.Hardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion,when the Eunuch (who had heard him from his hiding place at hishead) came up to him; whereupon the Fireman flea end stood afaroff to see what passed between them.  Then said the Eunuch to Zaual-Makan, "Peace be with thee, O my lord!" "And on thee bepeace," replied Zau al-Makan, "and the mercy of Allah and Hisblessings!" "O my lord," continued the Eunuch---And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,             When it was the Seventy-fourth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Eunuchsaid to Zau al-Makan, "O my lord, I have sought thee theseseveral times this night, for my mistress biddeth thee to her."Quoth Zau al- Makan, "And who be this bitch that seeketh for me? Allah curse her and curse her husband with her!"[FN#315] And hebegan to revile the Eunuch, who could make him no answer, becausehis mistress had charged him to do Zau al-Makan no hurt, norbring him save of his own especial free will; and, if he wouldnot accompany him, to give him the thousand diners.  So theCastrato began to speak him fair and say to him, "O my lord, takethis purse and go with me.  We will do thee no upright, O my son,nor wrong thee in aught; but our object is that thou bend thygracious steps with me to my mistress, to receive her answer andreturn in weal and safety: and thou shalt have a handsome presentas one who bringeth good news." When Zau al- Makan heard this, hearose and went with the Eunuch and walked among the sleepingfolk, stepping over them; whilst the Fireman followed after themfrom afar, and kept his eye upon him and said to himself, "Alasthe pity of his youth!  Tomorrow they will hang him." And heceased not following them till he approached theirstation,[FN#316] without any observing him.  Then he stood stilland said, "How base it will be of him, if he say it was I whobade him recite the verses!" This was the case of the Stoker; butas regards what befel Zau al-Makan, he ceased not walking withthe Eunuch till he reached his station and the Castrato went into Nuzhat al-Zaman and said, "O my lady, I have brought thee himwhom thou soughtest, and he is a youth, fair of face and bearingthe marks of wealth and gentle breeding." When she heard this,her heart fluttered and she cried, "Let him recite some verses,that I may hear him near hand, and after ask him his name and hiscondition and his native land." Then the Eunuch went out to Zaual-Makan and said to him, "Recite what verses thou knowest, formy lady is here hard by, listening to thee, and after I will askthee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition."Replied he, "With love and gladness but, an thou ask my name, itis erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste.  I have astory, the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of itbe shown, and behold, I am even as one who hath exceeded in winedrinking and who hath not spared himself; one who is afflictedwith distempers and who wandereth from his right mind, beingperplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought." WhenNuzhat al-Zaman heard this, she broke out into excessive weepingand sobbing, and said to the Eunuch, "Ask him if he have partedfrom one he loveth even as his mother or father." The Castratoasked as she bade him, and Zau al-Makan replied, "Yes, I haveparted from every one I loved: but the dearest of all to me wasmy sister, from whom Fate hath separated me." When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard this, she exclaimed, "Allah Almighty reunite him withwhat he loveth!"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Seventy-fifth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhatal-Zaman heard his words she said, "Allah reunite him with whathe loveth!" Then quoth she to the Eunuch, "Tell him to let mehear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and hiscountry." The Eunuch did so, and Zau al-Makan sighed heavily andbegan repeating these couplets,[FN#317]"Is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest?  * The house     that hometh Hinda be forever blest'Her love all levels; man can reck of naught beside; * Naught or     before or after can for man have zest'Tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris * That day     when Hinda's footstep on its face is prest:Hail to the beauty of our camp, the pride of folk, * The dearling     who en' Slaves all hearts by her behest:Allah on 'Time's Delight' send large dropped clouds that teem *     With genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast."And also these,"I vow to Allah if at home I sight * My sister Nuzhat al-Zamani     highsI'll pass the days in joyance and delight * Mid bashful minions,     maidens soft and white:To sound of harps in various modes they smite * Draining the     bowl, while eyes rain lively light'Neath half closed lids, a sipping lips red bright * By stream     bank flowing through my garden site."When he had finished his verse, Nuzhat al-Zaman lifted up a skirtof the litter curtain and looked at him.  As soon as her eyesfell on his face, she knew him for certain and cried out, "O mybrother!  O Zau al-Makan!" He also looked at her and knew her andcried out, "O my sister!  O Nuzhat al-Zaman!" Then she threwherself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twainfell down in a fainting fit.  When the Eunuch saw this case, hewondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them,waited till they should recover.  After a while they came tothemselves, and Nuzhat al-Zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy:oppression and depression left her and gladness took the masteryof her, and she repeated these verses,"Time sware my life should fare in woeful waste; * Forsworn art     Time, expiate thy sin in haste![FN#318]Comes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid; * To him who brings     good news, rise, gird thy waistI spurned old world tales of Eden bliss; * Till came I     Kausar[FN#319] on those lipsWhen Zau al-Makan heard this, he pressed his sister to hisbreast; tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and herepeated these couplets,[FN#320]"Long I lamented that we fell apart, * While tears repentant     railed from these eyne;And sware, if Time unite us twain once more, * 'Severance' shall     never sound from tongue of mine:Joy hath so overwhelmed me that excess * Of pleasure from mine     eyes draws gouts of brine:Tears, O mine eyes, have now become your wont * Ye weep for     pleasure and you weep for pine!"They sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him, "Comewith me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee,and I will tell thee what happened to me." So they entered andZau al-Maken said, "Do thou begin thy tale." Accordingly she toldhim all that had come to her since their separation at the Khanand what had happened to her with the Badawi; how the merchanthad bought her of him and had taken her to her brother Sharrkanand had sold her to him; how he had freed her at the time ofbuying; how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gonein to her and how the King, their sire, had sent and asked forher from Sharrkan.  Then quoth she, "Praised be Allah who hathvouchsafed thee to me and ordained that, even as we left ourfather together, so together shall we return to him!" And sheadded, "Of a truth my brother Sharrkan gave me in marriage tothis Chamberlain that he might carry me to my father.  And thisis what befel me from first to last; so now tell me how it hathfared with thee since I left thee." Thereupon he told her allthat had happened to him from beginning to end; and how Allahvouchsafed to send the Fireman to him, and how he had journeyedwith him and spent his money on him and had served him night andday.  She praised the Stoker for this and Zau al-Makan added, "Ofa truth, O my sister, this Fireman hath dealt with me in suchbenevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son,for that he fasted and gave me to eat, and he walked whilst hemade me ride; and I owe my life to him." Said she, "Allahwilling, we will requite him for all this, according to ourpower." Then she called the Eunuch, who came and kissed Zau al-Makan's hand, and she said, "Take thy reward for glad tidings, Oface of good omen!  It was thy hand reunited me with my brother;so the purse I gave thee and all in it are thine.  But now go tothy master and bring him quickly to me." The Castrato rejoicedand, going in to the Chamberlain, him to his mistress. Accordingly, he came in to his wife and finding Zau al-Makan withher, asked who he was.  So she told him all that had befallenthem both, first and last, and added, "Know, O Chamberlain, thatthou hast married no slave girl; far from it, thou hast taken towife the daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman for I am Nuzhat al-Zaman, and this is my brother, Zau al-Makan." When theChamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth, and itsmanifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he wasbecome King Omar bin al-Nu'uman's son in law, so he said tohimself, " 'Twill be my fate to be made viceroy of someprovince."[FN#321] Then he went up to Zau al-Makan and gave himjoy of his safety and reunion with his sister, and bade hisservants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best ofhis own horses to ride.  Thereupon said Nuzhat al-Zaman, "We arenow near our country and I would be left alone with my brother,that we may enjoy each other's company and take our fill of itere we reach Baghdad; for we have been parted a long, long time.""Be it as thou biddest," replied the Chamberlain, and, goingforth from them, sent them wax candles and various kinds ofsweetmeats, together with three suits of the costliest for Zaual-Makan.  Then he returned to the litter and related the good hehad done and Nuzhat al-Zaman said to him, "Bid the Eunuch bringme the Fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with atray of food morning and evening, and let him be forbidden toleave us." The Chamberlain called the Castrato and charged him todo accordingly; so he replied, "I hear and I obey;" and he tookhis pages with him and went out in search of the Stoker till hefound him in the rear of the caravan, girthing his ass andpreparing for flight.  The tears were running adown his cheeks,out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zaual-Makan; and he was saying to himself, "Indeed, I warned him forthe love of Allah, but he would not listen to me; Oh would I knewwhat is become of him!" Ere he had done speaking the Eunuch wasstanding by his head whilst the pages surrounded him The Firemanturned and seeing the Eunuch and the pages gathered around himbecame yellow with fear,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of dayand ceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the Seventy-sixth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theStoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself, saying,"Oh would I knew what is become of him!"; ere he had donespeaking the Castrato was standing by his head and his sidemuscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried,"Verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices I have donehim!  I believe he hath denounced me to the Eunuch (hence thesepages et about me) and he hath made me an accomplice in hiscrime." Then the effeminated one cried at him, saying, "Who wasit recited the verses?  O liar!  why didst thou say, 'I neverrepeated these couplets, nor do I know who repeated them;' whenit was thy companion?  But now I will not leave thee between thisplace and Baghdad, and what betideth thy comrade shall betidethee." Quoth the Fireman, "What I feared hath befallen me." Andhe repeated this couplet,"'Twas as I feared the coming ills discerning: * But unto Allah     we are all returning."Then the Eunuch cried upon the pages, saying, "Take him off theass." So they carried him along with the caravan, surrounded bythe pages, as the white contains the black of the eye; and theCastrato said to them, "If a hair of him be lost, you will belost with it." And he bade them privily treat him with honour andnot humiliate him.  But when the Stoker saw himself beset by thepages, he despaired of his life and turning to the Eunuch, saidto him, "O Chief, I am neither this youth's brother nor am I akinto him, nor is he sib to me; but I was a Fireman in a Hammam andfound him cast out, in his sickness, on the dung heap." Then thecaravan fared on and the Stoker wept and imagined in himself athousand things, whilst the Eunuch walked by his side and toldhim nothing, but said to him, "Thou disturbedst our mistress byreciting verses, thou and this youth: but fear nothing for thyself;" and kept laughing at him the while to himself.  Wheneverthe caravan halted, they served him with food, and he and theCastrato ate from one dish.[FN#322] Then the Eunuch bade his ladsbring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and, after drinking himself,gave it to the Fireman, who drank; but all the while his tearsnever dried, out of fear for his life and grief for hisseparation from Zau al-Makan and for what had befallen them intheir strangerhood.  So they both travelled on with the caravan,whilst the Chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife's litter,in attendance on Zau al-Makan and his sister, and now gave an eyeto the Fireman; and Nuzhat al-Zaman and her brother occupiedthemselves with converse and mutual condolence; and they ceasednot after this fashion till they came within three days' journeyfrom Baghdad.  Here they alighted at eventide and rested till themorning morrowed; and as they awoke and they were about to loadthe beasts, behold, there appeared afar off a great cloud of dustthat darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiestnight.[FN#323] Thereupon the Chamberlain cried out to them,"Stay, and your loading delay!"; then, mounting with hisMamelukes, rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud.  Whenthey drew near, suddenly appeared under it a numerous conqueringhost like the full tide sea, with flags and standards, drums andkettledrums, horsemen and footmen.  The Chamberlain marvelled atthis; and when the troops saw him, there detached itself fromamongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers, who fell upon himand his suite and surrounded them, five for one; whereupon saidhe to them, "What is the matter and what are these troops, thatye do this with us?" Asked they, "Who art thou; and whence comestthou, and whither art thou bound?" and he answered, "I am theChamberlain of the Emir of Damascus, King Sharrkan, son of Omarbin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, andI bring tribute and presents from him to his father in Baghdad."When the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefsfall over their faces and wept, saying, "In very sooth King Omaris dead and he died not but of poison.  So fare ye forwards; noharm shall befal you till you join his Grand Wazir, Dandan." Nowwhen the Chamberlain heard this, he wept sore and exclaimed, "Ohfor our disappointment in this our journey!" Then he and all hissuite wept till they had come up with the host and sought accessto the Wazir Dandan, who granted an interview and called a haltand, causing his pavilion to be pitched, sat down on a couchtherein and commanded to admit the Chamberlain.  Then he bade himbe seated and questioned him; and he replied that he wasChamberlain to the Emir of Damascus and was bound to King Omarwith presents and the tribute of Syria.  The Wazir, hearing themention of King Omar's name, wept and said, "King Omar is dead bypoison, and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselvesas to who should succeed him, until they were like to slay oneanother on this account; but the notables and grandees and thefour Kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer thematter to the decision of the four judges and that none shouldgainsay them.  So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetchthence the King's son, Sharrkan, and make him Sultan over hisfather's realm.  And amongst them were some who would have chosenthe cadet, Zau Al-Makan, for, quoth they, his name be Light ofthe Place, and he hath a sister Nuzhat al-Zaman highs, theDelight of the Time; but they set out five years ago for Al-Hijazand none wotteth what is become of them." When the Chamberlainheard this, he knew; that his wife had told him the truth of heradventures; and he grieved with sore grief for the death of KingOmar, albeit he joyed with exceeding joy, especially at thearrival of Zau al-Makan, for that he would now become Sultan ofBaghdad in his father's stead--And Shahrazad perceived the dawnof day and ceased saying her permitted say.             When it was the Seventy-seventh Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that whenSharrkan's Chamberlain heard of the death of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman he mourned, but he rejoiced because of his wife and herbrother Zau al-Makan who would become Sultan of Baghdad in hisfather's stead.  So he turned to the Wazir Dandan and said tohim, "Verily your tale is a wonder of wonders!  Know, O ChiefWazir, that here, where you have encountered me, Allah hath givenyou rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after theeasiest of fashions, for that His Almighty Will restoreth to youZau al-Makan and his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman; whereby we willsettle the matter as we easily can." When the Minister heardthese words he rejoiced with great joy and said, "O Chamberlain,tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the causeof their long absence." So he repeated to him the whole story andtold him that Nuzhat al-Zaman was his wife and related to him theadventures of Zau al-Makan from first to last.  As soon as he hadended his tale, the Wazir sent for the Emirs and Wazirs and ChiefOfficers and acquainted them with the matter; whereat theyrejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance.  Thenthey gathered in a body and went in to the Chamberlain and didtheir service to him, kissing the ground between his hands; andthe Wazir Dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stoodbefore him in honour.  After this, the Chamberlain held on thatday a Divan council; and he and the Wazir sat upon a throne,whilst all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State tooktheir places before them, according to their severalranks.[FN#324] Then they melted sugar in rose water and drank,after which the Emirs sat down to hold council and permitted therest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely, till theyshould make an end of their debate and overtake them.  So theofficers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting, rodeonwards, preceded by the standards of war.  When the grandees hadfinished their conference, they took horse and rejoined the host;and the Chamberlain approached the Wazir Dandan and said, "I deemit well to ride on before you, and precede you, that I may getready a place for the Sultan and notify him of your coming and ofyour choosing him as Sultan over the head of his brotherSharrkan." "Aright thou reckest," answered the Wazir Then theChamberlain rose up in haste and Dandan also stood up to do himhonour and brought him presents, which he conjured him to accept. In similar guise did all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers ofState, bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him andsaying to him, "Haply thou wilt mention our case to Sultan Zaual-Makan and speak to him to continue us in ourdignities."[FN#325] The Chamberlain promised all they requiredand bade his pages be ready to march, whereupon the Wazir Dandansent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at aday's journey from the city.  And they did his bidding.  Then theChamberlain mounted and rode forward, full of joy and saying tohimself, "How blessed is this gurney!", and indeed his wife wasexalted in his eyes, she and her brother Zau al-Makan.  They madeall haste over their wayfare, till they reached a place distant aday's journey from Baghdad, where the Chamberlain called a haltfor rest, and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting placefor the Sultan Zau al-Makan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman,while he rode forward with his Mamelukes and, alighting at adistance from Nuzhat al-Zaman's litter, commanded the eunuchs toask leave of admission to the presence.  They did so and she gavepermission; whereupon he went in to her and conversed with herand her brother; and told them of the death of their father; andof Zau al-Makan, how the heads of the people had made him Kingover them in the stead of his sire; and he gave them joy of thekingdom.  They both wept for their father and asked the manner ofhis being killed; but the Chamberlain answered, "The news restswith the Wazir Dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all thehost; and it only remaineth for thee, O King, to do what theycounsel, since they have unanimously chosen thee Sultan; for ifthou do not this, they will choose some one else and thou canstnot be sure of thy life with another Sultan.  Haply he will killthee, or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom passout of the hands of both." Zau al-Makan bowed his head awhile andthen said, "I accept this position;" for indeed there was norefusing; and he was certified that the Chamberlain hadcounselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way. Then he added, "O my uncle, how shall I do with my brotherSharrkan?" "O my son," replied the Chamberlain, "thy brother willbe Sultan of Damascus and thou Sultan of Baghdad; so take heartof grace and get ready thy case." Zau al-Makan accepted this andthe Chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and adagger[FN#326] of state, which the Wazir Dandan had brought withhim; then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot ofrising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion, wherein theSultan might sit to receive the Emirs and Grandees.  Moreover heordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and hecommanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs.  Theydid as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from theground and spread till it walled the horizon round.  Afterawhile, the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the armyof Baghdad and Khorasan, a conquering host like the full tidesea.--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to sayher permitted say.             When it was the Seventy-eighth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theChamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spaciousenough to receive the subjects flocking to their Sultan, theyplanted a splendid Shahmiyanah[FN#327] befitting Kings.  And asthey ended their labours behold, a dust cloud spired aloft andthe breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host;and presently it appeared that this was the army of Baghdad andKhorasan preceded by the Wazir Dandan.  And in it all rejoiced atthe accession of the "Light of the Place." Now Zau al-Makan haddonned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword ofstate: so the Chamberlain brought him a steed and he mountedsurrounded by the Mamelukes and all the company from the tents onfoot, to do him service, and he rode on until he came to thegreat pavilion, where he sat down and he laid the royal daggeracross his thighs, whilst the Chamberlain stood in attendance onhim and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entranceawning of the Shahmiyanah, with drawn swords in their hands. Presently, up came the troops and the host and craved admissionso the Chamberlain went in to Zau al-Makan and asked his leavewhereupon he bade admit them, ten by ten.  The Chamberlainacquainted them with the King's commands, to which they replied,"We hear and we obey;" and all drew up before the pavilionentrance.  Then he took ten of them and carried them through thevestibule into the presence of Sultan Zau al-Makan, whom whenthey saw, they were awed; but he received them with most graciouskindness and promised them all good.  So they gave him joy of hissafe return and invoked Allah's blessings upon him after whichthey took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught andthey kissed ground before him and withdrew.  Then other tenentered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers; andthey ceased not to enter, ten by ten, till none was left but theWazir Dandan.  Lastly the Minister went in and kissed the groundbefore Zau al-Makan, who rose to meet him, saying, "Welcome, OWazir and sire sans peer!  Verily, thine acts are those of acounsellor right dear, and judgement and foreseeing clear are inthe hands of the Subtle of Lere." Then bade he the Chamberlainforthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order allthe troops thereto.  So they came and ate and drank.  Moreoverthe Sultan commanded his Wazir Dandan call a ten days' halt ofthe army, that he might be private with him and learn from himhow and wherefore his father had been slain.  The Wazir obeyedthe commands of the Sultan with submission and wished himeternity of glory and said, "This needs must be!" He thenrepaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host tohalt ten days.  They did as he bade them and, moreover, he gavethem leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of thelords in waiting should attend upon the King for service duringthe space of three days.  Then the Wazir went to the Sultan andreported all to him, and Zau al-Makan waited until nightfall,when he went in to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman and asked her,"Dost thou know the cause of my father's murder or not?" "I haveno knowledge of the cause," she answered, and drew a silkencurtain before herself, whilst Zau al-Makan seated himselfwithout the curtain and commanded the Wazir to the presence and,when he came, said to him, "I desire thou relate to me in detailthe cause of the killing of my sire, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman!""Know then, O King," replied Dandan, "that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, when he returned to Baghdad from his chasing and huntingand entered the city, enquired for thee and thy sister, but couldnot find you and knew that you twain had gone on the Pilgrimage;whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered, and his breastwas straitened and he abode thus half a year, seeking news of youfrom all who came and went but none could give him any tidings. Now while we were in attendance upon him one day, after a wholeyear had sped since ye were lost to his sight, lo!  there came tous an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee, accompanied byfive damsels, high bosomed virgins like moons, endowed with suchbeauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe; and, tocrown their perfections of comeliness, they could read the Koranand were versed in various kinds of learning and in the historiesof bygone peoples.  Then that old woman sought audience of theKing, and he bade admit her; whereupon she entered the presenceand kissed the ground between his hands.  I was then sitting byhis side and he, seeing in her the signs of asceticism anddevoutness, made her draw near and take seat hard by him.  Andwhen she had sat down she addressed him and said, 'Know, O King,that with me are five damsels, whose like no King among the Kingspossesseth; for they are endowed with wit and beauty andloveliness and perfection.  They read the Koran--and theTraditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in thehistory of bygone races.  They stand here between thy hands to dothee service, O King of the Age, and it is by trial that folk areprized or despised.  'Thy father, who hath found mercy;[FN#328]looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him; so he said tothem, Let each and every of you make me hear something of whatshe knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peopleslong gone before!'--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Seventy-ninth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the WazirDandan said unto King Zau al-Makan, "Thy father, who hath foundmercy, glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and hesaid to them, 'Let each and every of you make me hear somethingof what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and ofpeoples long gone before!' Thereupon one of them came forwardand, kissing the ground before him, spake as follows[FN#329]'Know, O King, that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschewimpertinence and adorn himself with excellencies, and observe theDivine injunctions and avoid mortal sins; and to this he shouldapply himself with the assiduity of one who, if he straytherefrom, falleth into perdition; for the foundation of goodbreeding is virtuous behaviour.  And know that the chief causeand reason of man's existence is the endeavour after lifeeverlasting, and the right way thereto is the service of Allah. Wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people:and swerve not from this canon, for the mightier men are indignity, the more their need of prudence and foresight; andindeed Monarchs need this more than the many, for the generalcast themselves into affairs, without taking thought to the issuethereof.  Be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way ofAllah, and know that, if an enemy dispute with thee, thou maystdispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof againsthim; but as for thy friend, there is none can judge between theeand him save righteousness and fair dealing.  Choose, therefore,thy friend for thyself, after thou hast proved him.  If he be ofthe brotherhood of futurity,[FN#330] let him be zealous inobserving the externals of the Holy Law and versed in its innermeaning, as far as may be; and if he be of the brotherhood of theworld, let him be free born, sincere, neither a fool nor aperverse, for the fool man is such that even his parents mightwell flee from him, and a liar cannot be a true friend.  Indeedthe word, Siddik[FN#331] ('friend') deriveth from Sidk ('truth')that welleth up from the bottom of the heart; and how can this bethe case, when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue?  And know,that the observance of the Law profiteth him who practiseth it:so love thy brother, if he be of this quality and do not cast himoff, even if thou see in him that which irketh thee, for a friendis not I like a wife, whom one can divorce and re-marry: nay, hisheart is like glass: once broken, it may not be mended.  AndAllah bless him who saith,'Ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart; * 'Tis hard to win     thee back the heart offended:For hearts indeed, whence love is alien made, * Like broken glass     may nevermore be mended.'The maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us whatsages say, 'The best of brethren is he who is the most constantin good counsel; the best of action is that which is fairest inits consequence, and the best of praise is not that which is inthe mouths of men.  It is also said, 'It behoveth not the servantto neglect thanking Allah especially for two favours, health andreason.' Again it is said, 'Whoso honoureth himself, his lust isa light matter to him, and he who maketh much of his smalltroubles, Allah afflicteth him with the greater; he who obeyethhis own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth tothe slanderer loseth the true friend.  He who thinketh well ofthee, do thou fulfill his thought of thee.  He who exceedeth incontention sinneth, and he who against upright standeth not onward, is not safe from the sword.  Now will I tell thee somewhatof the duties of Kazis and judges.  Know, O King, that nojudgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given afterproof positive, and it behoveth the judge to treat all people onthe same level, to the intent that the great may not hunger foroppression nor the small despair of justice.  Furthermore heshould extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath uponthe defendant; and mediation is admissible between Moslems,except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbiddingthe lawful.[FN#332] If thou shalt have done aught during the day,of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved,thou (O Kazi) shouldst revert to the right, for to do justice isa religious obligation and to return to that which is right isbetter than persistence in wrong.  Then (O judge) thou shouldeststudy precedents and the law of the case and do equal justicebetween the suitors, withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth andcommitting thine affair to Allah (be He extolled and exalted!). And require thou proof of the complainant, and if he adduceevidence let him have due benefit of it; and if not, put thedefendant to his oath; for this is the ordinance of Allah. Receive thou the testimony of competent Moslem witnesses, oneagainst other, for Almighty Allah hath commanded judges to judgeby externals, He Himself taking charge of the inner and secretthings.  It behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet,whilst suffering from stress of pain or hunger,[FN#333] and thatin his decisions between folk he seek the face of Allah Almightyfor he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself,Allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and thepeople.' Quoth al-Zuhri,[FN#334] 'There are three things forwhich, if they be found in a Kazi, he should be deposed; namely,if he honour the base, if he love praise and if he feardismissal.  And Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once deposed a Kazi, whoasked him, 'Why hast thou dismissed me?  It hath reached me,'answered Omar, 'that thy converse is greater than thy condition.'It is said also that Iskandar[FN#335] said to his Kazi, 'I haveinvested thee with this function and committed to thee in it mysoul and mine honour and my manliness; so do thou guard it withthy sense and thine understanding.' To his Cook he said, 'Thouart the Sultan of my body; so look thou tender it as thine ownself.' To his Secretary he said, 'Thou art the controller of mywit: so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me andfrom me.'" Thereupon the first damsel backed out from thepresence and a second damsel came forward.--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.                When it was the Eightieth Night,She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that theWazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, "Thereupon the first damselbacked out from the presence and a second damsel came forwardand, kissing the ground seven times before the King thy father,spake as follows, 'The sage Lukman[FN#336] said to his son,'There be three who are known only in three several cases; themerciful man is unknown save in time of wrath, the brave only inbattle, and thy friend in time of need.' It is said that theoppressor shall be depress though by people praised, and that theoppress is at rest though by people blamed.  Quoth AllahAlmighty,[FN#337] 'Assuredly deem not that those who rejoice inwhat they have done, and who love to be praised for what theyhave not done, shall escape reckoning of punishment: indeed thereis reserved for them a grievous penalty.' And he said[FN#338] (onwhom be salvation and salutation!), 'Works are according tointention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth.'He said also, 'In the body is a part which being sound the restis sound, and which being unsound the whole is unsound.' And thisis the heart.  Now this heart is the most marvellous of what isin man, since it is that which ordereth his whole affair: Ifcovetise stir in it, desire destroyeth him, and if afflictionmaster it, anguish slayeth him; if anger rage in it, danger ishard upon him; if it be blest with contentment, he is safe fromdiscontent; if fear surprise it, he is full of mourning; and ifcalamity overtake it, affliction betideth him.  If a man gain theuse of wealth, peradventure he is diverted thereby from theremembrance of his Lord; if poverty choke him his heart isdistracted by woe, or if disquietude waste his heart, weaknesscauseth him to fall.  Thus, in any case, nothing profiteth himbut that he be mindful of Allah and occupy himself with gaininghis livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next. It was asked of a certain sage, 'Who is the most ill conditionedof men?'; and he answered, 'The man whose lusts master hismanhood and whose mind soareth over high, so that his knowledgedispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth; and how excellently saiththe poet,Freest am I of all mankind fro' meddling wight * Who, seeing     others err, self error ne'er can sight:Riches and talents are but loans to creature lent, * Each wears     the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite:If by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make, * Thou shalt go     wrong and if the door be right, go right!'Continued the maiden, 'As for anecdotes of devotees, quoth Hishambin Bashar, 'I asked Omar bin Ubayd, What is true piety?'; and heanswered, 'The Apostle of Allah (to whom be salutation andsalvation!) hath explained it when he sayeth, The pious is he whoforgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth thatwhich endureth to that which passeth away; who counteth not themorrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead.' Andit is related that Abu Zarr[FN#339] used to say, Want is dearerto me than wealth, and unheal is dearer to me than health.' Quothone of the listeners, 'May Allah have mercy on Abu Zarr!'.  Formy part, I say, 'Whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of theelection of Almighty Allah should be content with that conditionwhich Allah hath chosen for him.' Quoth one of the Companions ofthe Prophet, 'Ibn Abi Aufa[FN#340] once prayed with us the dawnprayer.  When he had done, he recited, 'O ThouEnwrapped!'[FN#341] till he came to where Allah saith, 'Whenthere shall be a trumping on the trumpet,' and fell down dead. It is said that Sabit al-Banani wept till he well nigh lost hiseyes.  They brought him a man to medicine him who said to him, 'Iwill cure thee, provided thou obey my bidding' Asked Sabit, 'Inwhat matter?' Quoth the leach, 'In that thou leave weeping!''What is the worth of mine eyes?', rejoined Sabit, 'if they donot weep?' Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, 'Exhort thoume!'"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to sayher permitted say.              When it was the Eighty-first Night,She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that theWazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, "Thus spake the second handmaid to the King who hath found mercy, Omar bin al-Nu'uman. 'Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, Exhort thou me!' 'I exhortthee,' replied he, 'to be a self ruler, an abstainer in thisworld, and in the next a greedy slave.' 'How so?' asked the otherand Mohammed answered, 'The abstinent man in this worldconquereth both the world that is and the world to come.' Andquoth Ghaus bin Abdillah, 'There were two brothers among the sonsof Israel, one of whom said to the other, 'What be the mostperilous[FN#342] thing thou hast done?' Replied the brother, 'Ionce came upon a nest of young birds; so I took out one and threwit back into the nest; but among the chickens were some whichdrew apart from it.  This is the most perilous thing I ever did;now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done?' Herejoined, 'When I arise for prayer I am fearful that it is onlyfor the sake of the reward.' Now their father heard these wordsand exclaimed, 'O Allah, an say they sooth take them to Thyself!'It was declared by one of the wise men, 'Verily, these were ofthe most virtuous of children.' Quoth Sa'id bin Jubayr,[FN#343]'I was once in company with Fuzalah bin 'Ubaydand said to him,'Exhort thou me!, Replied he, 'Bear in mind these twonecessaries, Shun syntheism[FN#344] and harm not any of Allah'screatures.' And he repeated these two couplets,'Be as thou wilt, for Allah still is bounteous Lord, * And care     dispeller dread not therefore bane and banTo two things only never draw thee nigh, nor give * Partner to     Allah trouble to thy brother man.'And how well saith the poet,'An thou of pious works a store neglect * And after death meet     one who did collect,Thou shalt repent thou diddest not as he, * Nor madest ready as     he did elect.'Then the third damsel came forward, after the second had withdrawn, and said, 'Of a truth, the chapter of piety is exceedingwide; but I will mention what occurreth to me thereof, concerningthe pious of old.  Quoth a certain holy man, 'I congratulatemyself in death, though I am not assured of rest therein, savethat I know death interveneth between a man and his works; so Ihope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of illworks.' And Ita'a al Salami, when he had made an end of anexhortation, was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore; and asthey asked him why he did this he answered, 'I desire to enterupon a grave matter, and it is the standing up before AlmightyAllah to do in accordance with my exhortation.' In similar guiseZayn al-Abidin,[FN#345] son of Al-Husayn, was wont to tremblewhen he rose to pray.  Being asked the cause of this, he replied,'Know ye not before whom I stand and whom I address?' It is saidthat there lived near Sufyan al-Thauri[FN#346] a blind man who,when the month of Ramazan came, went out with the folk topray,[FN#347] but remained silent and hung back.  Said Sufyan,'On the Day of Resurrection he shall come with the people of theKoran and they will be distinguished by increase of honour fromtheir fellows.' Quoth Sufyan, 'Were the soul established in theheart as befitteth, it would fly away for joy and pining forParadise, and for grief and fear of hell-fire.' It is relatedalso of Sufyan Al-Thauri that he said, 'To look upon the face ofa tyrant is a sin.' Then the third damsel retired and came forward the fourth, who said, 'Here am I to treat of sundrytraditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me.  It isrelated that Bishr Barefoot[FN#348] said, 'I once heard Khalidsay, 'Beware of secret polytheism.' I asked, 'What may secretpolytheism be?'; and he answered, 'When one of you in prayingprolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause ofimpurity[FN#349] come upon him.' And one of the sages said,'Doing works of weal expiateth what is ill.' QuothIbrahim,[FN#350] 'I supplicated Bishr Barefoot to acquaint mewith some theological mysteries; but he said, 'O my son, thisknowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one; of everyhundred five, even as the legal alms upon money.' Said Ibrahim,'I thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while I waspraying behold, Bishr was also praying: so I stood behindhim[FN#351] making the prayer bow till the Mu'ezzin called hiscall.  Then rose a man of tattered appearance and said, O folk,beware of a truth which bringeth unweal, for there is no harm ina lie bringing weal,[FN#352] and in time of need no choice weheed: speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even assilence hurteth not in the presence of good.  Presently I sawBishr drop a danik,[FN#353] so I picked it up and exchanged itfor a dirham which I gave him.  Quoth he, 'I will not take it.'Quoth I, 'It is perfectly lawful change'; but he rejoined 'Icannot take in exchange the riches of the present world for thoseof the future world.' It is related also that Bishr Barefoot'ssister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal"[FN#354]--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Eighty-second Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the WazirDandan continued to bespeak Zau al-Makan on this wise, "And quoththe maiden to thy father, 'Bishr Barefoot's sister once went toAhmad bin Hanbal and said to him, 'O Imam of the Faith, we are afamily that spin thread by night and work for our living by day;and oftentimes the cressets of the watch of Baghdad pass by andwe on the roof spinning by their light.  Is this forbidden tous?' Asked Ahmad:'Who are thou?' 'I am the sister of BishrBarefoot,' answered she.  Rejoined the Iman, 'O household ofBishr, I shall never cease to drink full draughts of piety fromyour hearts.' Quoth one of the sages, 'When Allah willeth well toHis servant He openeth upon him the gate of action.' Malik binDinar,[FN#355] when he passed through the bazar and saw aught hedesired, was wont to say, 'O soul, take patience, for I will notaccord to thee what thou desirest.' He said also (Allah accepthim!), 'The salvation of the soul lies in resistance to it andits damnation in submission to it.' Quoth Mansur binAmmar,[FN#356] 'I made a pilgrimage and was faring Meccahwards byway of Cufa, and the night was overcast, when I heard a voicecrying out from the deeps of the darkness saying, 'O Allah, Iswear by Thy Greatness and Thy Glory, I meant not through mydisobedience to transgress against Thee; for indeed I am notignorant of Thee; but my fault is one Thou didst foreordain to mefrom eternity without beginning;[FN#357] so do Thou pardon mytransgression, for indeed I disobeyed Thee of my ignorance!' Whenhe had made an end of his prayer he recited aloud the verse, 'Otrue believers, save your souls and those of your families fromthe fire whose fuel is men and stones.'[FN#358] Then I heard afall, but not knowing what it was I passed on.  When the morningmorrowed, as we went our way, behold, we fell in with a funeraltrain, followed by an old woman whose strength had left her.  Iasked her of the dead, and she answered, 'This is the funeral ofa man who passed by us yesterday whilst my son was standing atprayer and after his prayers he recited a verse from the Book ofAllah Almighty when the man's gall bladder burst and he felldead.' Therewith the fourth damsel retired and the fifth cameforward and said, 'I here will also repeat what occurreth to meregarding the acts of devotees in olden time.  Maslamah bin Dinarused to say, 'By making sound the secret thoughts, sins great andsmall are covered'; and, 'when the servant of Allah is resolvedto leave sinning, victory cometh to him.' Also quoth he, 'Everyworldly good which doth not draw one nearer to Allah is acalamity, for a little of this world distracteth from a mickle ofthe world to come and a mickle of the present maketh thee forgetthe whole of the future.' It was asked of Abu Hazim,[FN#359] 'Whois the most prosperous of men?'; and he answered, 'Whoso spendethhis life in submission to Allah.' The other enquired, 'And who isthe most foolish of mankind?' 'Whoso selleth his future for theworldly goods of others,' replied Abu Hazim.  It is reported ofMoses[FN#360] (on whom be peace!) that when he came to the watersof Midian he exclaimed, 'O Lord, verily I stand in need of thegood which thou shalt send down to me.'[FN#361] And he asked ofhis Lord and not of his folk.  There came two damsels and he drewwater for them both and allowed not the shepherds to draw first. When the twain returned, they informed their father Shu'ayb (onwhom be peace!) who said, 'Haply, he is hungry,' adding to one ofthem, 'Go back to him and bid him hither.' Now when she came toMoses, she veiled her face and said, 'My father biddeth thee tohim that he may pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for us.'Moses was averse to this and was not willing to follow her.  Nowshe was a woman large in the back parts, and the wind blowingupon her garment[FN#362] covered the hinder cheeks to Moses;which when Moses saw, he lowered his eyes and said to her, 'Getthee behind while I walk in front.' So she followed him till heentered the house of Shu'ayb where supper was ready."--AndShahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say herpermitted say.              When it was the Eighty-third Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the WazirDandan continued to Zau al-Makan, "Now, quoth the fifth damsel tothy sire, 'When Moses (on whom be peace!) entered the home ofShu'ayb where supper was ready, Shu'ayb said to him, 'O Moses, Idesire to pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for thesetwo.' But Moses answered, 'I am of a household which sellethnothing of the fashion of the next world[FN#363] for what is onearth of gold and silver.' Then quoth Shu'ayb, 'O youth! nevertheless thou art my guest, and it is my wont and that of myforbears to honour the guest by setting food before him.' SoMoses sat down and ate.  Then Shu'ayb hired Moses for eightpilgrimages, that is to say, eight years, and made his wagemarriage with one of his two daughters, and Moses' service to himwas to stand for her dowry.  As saith the Holy Writ of him,'Verily I will give thee one of these my two daughters inmarriage, on condition that thou serve me for hire eightpilgrimages: and if thou fulfil ten years, it is in thine ownbreast; for I seek not to impose a hardship on thee.'[FN#364] Acertain man once said to one of his friends whom he had not metfor many days, 'Thou hast made me desolate, for that I have notseen thee this long while.' Quoth the other, 'I have beendistracted from thee by Ibn Shihab: dost thou know him?' Quothhis friend, 'Yes, he hath been my neighbour these thirty years,but I have never spoken to him.' He replied, 'Verily thouforgettest Allah in forgetting--thy neighbour!  If thou lovedstAllah thou wouldst love thy neighbour.  Knowest thou not that aneighbour hath a claim upon his neighbour,[FN#365] even as theright of kith and kin?' Said Huzayfah, 'We entered Meccah withIbrahim bin Adham, and Shakik al-Balkhi was also making apilgrimage that year.  Now we met whilst circumambulating theKa'abah and Ibrahim said to Shakik, 'What is your fashion in yourcountry?' Replied Shakik, 'When we are blest with our daily breadwe eat, and when we hunger we take patience.' 'This wise,' saidIbrahim, 'do the dogs of Balkh; but we, when blest with plenty,do honour to Allah and when an hungered we thank Him.' And Shakikseated himself before Ibrahim and said to him, 'Thou art mymaster.' Also said Mohammed bin Imran, 'A man once asked of Hatimthe Deaf[FN#366] 'What maketh thee to trust in Allah?' 'Twothings,' answered he, 'I know that none save myself shall eat mydaily bread, so my heart is at rest as to that; and I know that Iwas not created without the knowledge of Allah, and am abashedbefore Him.' Then the fifth damsel retired and the ancient damecame forward and, kissing the ground before thy father ninetimes, said, 'Thou hast heard, O King, what these all have spokenon the subject of piety; and I will follow their example inrelating what hath reached me of the famous men of past times. It is said that the Imam al-Shafi'i departed the night into threeportions, the first for study, the second for sleep and the thirdfor prayer.  The Imam Abu Hanifah[FN#367] was wont also to passhalf the night in prayer.  Oneday a man pointed him out to another, as he walked by andremarked, 'Yonder man watcheth the whole night.' When he heardthis Abu Hanifah said, 'I was abashed before Allah to hear myselfpraised for what was not in me'; so after this he used to watchthe whole night.  And one of the Sages hath said,'Who seeketh for pearl in the Deep dives deep; * Who on high     would hie robs his night of sleep.'Al-Rabi a relates that Al-Shafi'i used to recite the whole Koranseventy times during the month of Ramazan, and that in his dailyprayers.  Quoth Al-Shafi'i (Allah accept him!), 'During ten yearsI never ate my fill of barley bread, for fullness hardeneth theheart and deadeneth the wit and induceth sleep and enfeebleth onefrom standing up to pray.'[FN#368] It is reported of Abdullah binMohammed al-Sakra that he said, 'I was once talking with Omar andhe observed to me, 'Never saw I a more God fearing or eloquentman than Mohammed bin Idris al-Shafi'i.' It so happened I wentout one day with Al-Haris bin Labib al-Saffar, who was a discipleof Al-Muzani[FN#369] and had a fine voice and he read the sayingof the Almighty, 'This shall be a day whereon they shall notspeak to any purpose, nor shall they be permitted to excusethemselves.'[FN#370] I saw Al-Shafi'i's colour change; his skinshuddered with horripilation, he was violently moved and he felldown in a fainting fit When he revived he said, 'I take refugewith Allah from the stead of the liars and the lot of thenegligent!  O Allah, before whom the hearts of the wise abasethemselves, O Allah, of Thy bene ficence accord to me theremission of my sins, adorn me with the curtain of Thy protectionand pardon me my shortcomings, by the magnanimity of Thy Being!'Then I rose and went away.  Quoth one of the pious, 'When Ientered Baghdad, Al-Shafi'i was there.  So I sat down on theriver bank to make the ablution before prayer; and behold, therepassed me one who said, 'O youth, make thy Wuzu-ablution well andAllah will make it well for thee in this world and in the next.'I turned and lo!  there was a man behind whom came a company ofpeople.  So I hastened to finish my ablution and followed him. Presently, he turned and asked me, 'Say, dost thou want aught?''Yes,' answered I, 'I desire that thou teach me somewhat of thatwhich Allah Almighty hath taught thee.' He said, 'Know then thatwhoso believeth in Allah shall be saved, and whoso jealouslyloveth his faith shall be delivered from destruction, and whosopractiseth abstinence in this world, his eyes shall be solaced onthe morrow of death.  Shall I tell thee any more?' I replied,'Assuredly;' and he continued, 'Be thou of the world that is,heedless; and of the world to come, greediest.  Be truthful inall thy dealings, and thou shalt be saved with theSalvationists.' Then he went on and I asked about him and wastold that he was the Imam Al-Shafi'i.  Al-Shafi'i was wont toremark, 'I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine, oncondition that nothing of it be attributed to me."--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Eighty-fourth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the WazirDandan continued to Zau al-Makan, "The old woman bespake thysire, saying, 'The Imam Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, I love tosee folk profit by this learning of mine on condition thatnothing of it be attributed to me.' He also said, 'I neverdisputed with any one, but I would that Almighty Allah shouldgive him the knowledge of the Truth and aid him to dispread it:nor did I ever dispute with anyone at all but for the showingforth of the Truth, and I reck not whether Allah manifest it bymy tongue or by His.' He said also (whom Allah accept!), 'If thoufear to grow conceited of thy lore, then bethink thee Whose gracethou seekest and for what good thou yearnest and what punishmentthou dreadest.' It was told to Abu Hanifah that the Commander ofthe Faithful, Abu Ja'afar al-Mansur, had appointed him Kazi andordered him a salary of ten thousand dirhams; but he would notaccept of this; and, when the day came on which the money was tobe paid him, he prayed the dawn prayer, then covered his headwith his robe--and spoke not.  When the Caliph's messenger camewith the money, he went in to the Imam and accosted him, but hewould not speak to him.  So the messenger said, 'Verily thismoney is lawfully thine.' 'I know that it is lawfully mine,'replied he: 'but I abhor that the love of tyrants get a hold uponmy heart.'[FN#371]  Asked the other, 'If thou go in to them canstthou not guard thyself from loving them?' Answered Abu Hanifah,'Can I look to enter the sea without my clothes being wet?'Another of Al-Shafi'i's sayings (Allah accept him!) is,'Oh soul of me, an thou accept my rede, * Thou shalt be wealthy     and of grace entire:Cast off ambitious hopes and vain desires, * How many a death was     done by vain desire!'Among the sayings of Sufyan al-Thauri, with which he admonishedAli bin al-Hasan al-Salami was, 'Be thou a man of truth and 'warelies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride.  Be not indebted saveto Him who is merciful to His debtors; and let thine associate beone who shall dissociate thee from the world.  Be ever mindful ofdeath and be constant in craving pardon of Allah and inbeseeching of Allah peace for what remaineth of thy life. Counsel every True Believer, when he asketh thee concerning thethings of his faith; and beware of betraying a Believer, forwhoso betrayeth a Believer, betrayeth Allah and His Apostle. Avoid dissensions and litigation; and leave that which causethdoubt in thee for things which breed no doubt:[FN#372] so shaltthou be at peace.  Enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence: soshalt thou be loved of Allah.  Adorn thine inner man and Allahshall adorn thine outer man.  Accept the excuse of him whoexcuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the Moslems.  Drawnear unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those thatmisuse thee: so shalt thou be the friend of the Prophets.  Letthine affairs, both public and private, be in Allah's charge, andfear Him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and whofareth towards Resurrection and Judgement stead between the handsof the Lord of Dread; and remember that to one of two houses thouart sped, either for Heavens eterne or to the Hell fires thatburn.' Thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels.  Nowwhen thy father, who hath found mercy, heard their discourse, heknew that they were the most accomplished of the people of theirtime; and, seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent oftheir wisdom and lore, he showed them all favour.  Moreover, heturned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour, and setapart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodgedPrincess Abrizah, daughter of the King of Greece, to which hebade carry all the luxuries they needed.  They abode with him tendays and the old woman abode with them; and, whenever the Kingvisited them, he found her absorbed in prayer, watching by nightand fasting by day; whereby love of her took hold upon his heartand he said to me, 'O Wazir, verily this old woman is of thepious, and awe of her is strong in my heart.' Now on the eleventhday, the King visited her, that he might pay her the price of thedamsels; but she said to him, 'O King, know that the price ofthese maidens surpasseth the competence of men; indeed I seek notfor them either gold or silver or jewels, be it little or much.'Now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her,'O my lady and what is their price?'; whereto she answered, 'Iwill not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast,watching by night a whole month, and abstaining by day, all forthe love of Allah Almighty; and, if thou do this, they are thyproperty to use in thy palace as thou please.' So the Kingwondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety andabnegation; she was magnified in his eyes and he said, 'Allahmake this pious woman to profit us!' Then he agreed with her tofast for a month as she had stipulated, and she said to him, 'Iwill help thee with the prayers I pray for thee and now bring mea gugglet of water.' They brought one and she took it and recitedover it and muttered spells, and sat for an hour speaking inspeech no one understood or knew aught thereof.  Lastly shecovered it with a cloth and, sealing it with her signet ring,gave it to thy sire, saying, 'When thou hast fasted the first tendays, break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in thisgugglet, for it will root out the love of the world from thyheart and fill it with light and faith.  As for me, tomorrow Iwill go forth to my brethren, the Invisible[FN#373] Controuls,for I yearn after them, and I will return to thee when the firstten days are past.  Thy father took the gugglet and arose and setit apart in a closet of his palace, then locked the door and putthe key in his pocket.  Next day the King fasted and the oldwoman went her ways."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of dayand ceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Eighty-fifth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the WazirDandan thus continued to Zau al-Makan, "Now when came the day forthe Sultan's fast, the old woman went her ways.  And after he hadaccomplished the ten days thereof, on the eleventh he opened thegugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to hisstomach.  Within the second ten days of the month the old womanreturned, bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf, like noleaf of known tree.  She went in to thy sire and saluted him;and, when he saw her, he rose to her saying, 'Welcome, O piouslady!' 'O King,' quoth she, 'the Invisible Controuls salute thee,for I told them of thee, and they rejoiced in thee and have sentthee their Halwa,[FN#374] which is of the sweetmeats of the otherworld.  Do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day.' TheKing rejoiced at this with great joy, and exclaimed, 'Praised beAllah, who hath given me brethren of the Invisible World!'Thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands; andhe honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour.  She wentforth for the twenty days of thy father's fast at the end ofwhich time she came to him and said, 'Know, O King, that I toldthe Invisible Controuls of the love which is between me and thee,and informed them how I had left the maidens with thee, and theywere glad that the damsels should belong to a King like thee; forthey were wont, when they saw them, to be strenuous in offeringon their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted.  So I wouldfain carry them to the Invisible Controuls that they may benefitby the breath of their favour, and peradventure, they shall notreturn to thee without some treasure of the treasures of theearth, that thou, after completing thy fast, mayst occupy thyselfwith their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bringthee, to the extent of thy desires.' When thy sire heard herwords, he thanked her for them and said, 'Except that I fear tocross thee, I would not accept the treasure or aught else; butwhen wilt thou set out with them?' Replied she, 'On the seven andtwentieth night; and I will bring them back to thee at the headof the month, by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fastand they will have had their courses and be free from impurity;and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal.  By Allah,each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom!' He said, 'Iknow it, O pious lady!' Then quoth the old woman, 'There is nohelp but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who isdear to thee, that she may find solace and seek a blessing of theInvisible Controuls.' Quoth he, 'I have a Greek slave calledSophia, by whom I have been blessed with two children, a girl anda boy; but they were lost; years ago.  Take her with thee thatshe may get the blessing'"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn ofday and ceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the Eighty-sixth Night, She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the WazirDandan continued to Zau al-Makan, "Quoth thy sire to the ancientwoman when she demanded the handmaids of him, 'I have a Greekslave called Sophia, by whom I have been blest with two children,a girl and a boy, but they were lost years ago; so take her withthee, haply she may get the benediction and, belike, theInvisible Controuls will sue Allah for her that her two childrenmay be restored to her.' 'Thou hast said well,' replied she; 'forthat indeed was her grievousest want.' Thy sire gave not overfinishing his fast till the old woman said to him, 'O my son, Iam going to the Invisible Controuls; so bring me Sophia.'Accordingly, he summoned her and she came forthright, and hedelivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the otherdamsels.  Then she went in to her chamber and bringing out asealed cup, presented it to the Sultan saying, 'On the thirtiethday, do thou repair to the Hammam and when thou comest out, enterone of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup. Then sleep, and thou shalt attain what thou seekest, and peace bewith thee'!  Thereat the King was glad and thanked her and kissedher hands.  Quoth she, 'I commend thee to Allah's care;' whereatquoth he, 'And when shall I see thee again, O pious lady?  Invery sooth I love not to part with thee.' Then she called downblessings on him and departed with the five damsels and theQueen; whilst the King fasted after her departure other threedays, till the month ended, when he arose and went to the Hammamand coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace,commanding that none should go in to him.  There, after makingfast the door, he drank what was in the cup and lay down tosleep; and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day, but hedid not come out and we said, 'Perchance he is tired with thebath and with watching by night and fasting by day; wherefore hesleepeth.' So we waited till next day; but still he did not comeforth.  Then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haplyhe might awake and ask what was the matter.  But nothing came ofthat; so at last we lifted up the door;[FN#375] and, going in,found him dead, with his flesh torn into strips and bits and hisbones broken.[FN#376] When we saw him in this condition it wasgrievous to us, and we took up the cup and found within its covera piece of paper whereon was inscribed, 'Whoso doeth evil leavethno regrets, and this be the reward of him who playeth traitorwith the daughters of Kings and who debaucheth them; and we makeknown to all who fall upon this scroll that Sharrkan, when hecame to our country, seduced our Queen Abrizah; nor did thatsuffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her toyou.  Then he[FN#377] sent her away in company of a black slavewho slew her, and we found her lying dead on the desert sward andthrown out to wild beasts.  This be no kingly deed, and he whodid this is requited with naught but what he merited.  So do yesuspect none of having killed him, for no one slew him but thecunning witch, whose name is Zat al-Dawahi.  And behold, I havetaken the King's wife, Sophia, and have carried her to herfather, Afridun King of Constantinople.  Moreover, there is nohelp for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and takeyour country from you, and ye shall be cut off even to the lastman, nor shall a living soul be spared by Death nor one whobloweth fire with his breath, save he who Cross and Belt[FN#378]worshippeth.' When we read this paper, we knew that the ancientwoman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us:whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sorewhen weeping availed us naught.  And the troops fell out as towhom they should make Sultan; some would have thee, and otherswould have thy brother Sharrkan; and we ceased not to disputeabout this for the space of a month, at the end of which certainof us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother Sharrkan:so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee.  Andsuch is the manner of the death of Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman!"Now when the Wazir Dandan had made an end of his story, Zau al-Makan and his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman wept; and the Chamberlain,who wept also, said to Zau al-Makan, "O King, weeping will availthee naught; nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thyheart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty; forverily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead." Thereupon Zaual-Makan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set upwithout the pavilion, and then commanded the army to pass inreview order before him.  And the Chamberlain sat by his side andall the armour-bearers[FN#379] behind him, whilst the WazirDandan and the rest of the Emirs and Grandees stood each in hisindividual stead.  Then quoth King Zau al-Makan to the MinisterDandan, "Inform me concerning my sire's treasures;" and hereplied, "I hear and I obey;" and gave him to know of the lateKing's hoards and monies, and what was in the treasury of amassedwealth and jewels, and acquainted him with other precious things. So Zau al-Makan opened his hand to the army, and gave a sumptuousrobe of honour to the Wazir Dandan, saying, "Thou continues" inoffice.  Whereupon Dandan kissed the ground before him and wishedhim long life.  Then he bestowed dresses on the Emirs, afterwhich he said to the Chamberlain, "Bring out before me thetribute of Damascus that is with thee." So he was shown thechests of money and rarities and jewels, when he took them andparted them all amongst the troops,--And Shahrazad perceived thedawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.             When it was the Eighty-seventh Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zau al-Makan ordered the Chamberlain to bring out before him what he hadbrought of the tribute of Damascus; and, when he was shown thechests of money and rarities and jewels, he took them and partedthem all amongst the troops, till nothing was left.  And theEmirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life,saying, "Never saw we a King, who gave the like of these gifts."Then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gaveorders for marching.  So they marched for three days, till, onthe fourth day, they drew near to Baghdad.  When they entered thecity, they found it decorated, and Zau al-Makan, the Sultan, wentup to his father's palace and sat down on the throne, whilst theEmirs of the army and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain ofDamascus stood between his hands.  Then he bade his privatesecretary write a writ to his brother Sharrkan, acquainting himwith all that had passed, from first to last, and he concluded,"As soon as thou hast read this letter, make ready thine affairand join us with thine army, that we may turn to Holy War uponthe Infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out thestain upon our honour." Then he folded the letter and sealed itwith his seal ring and said to the Minister Dandan, "None shallcarry this letter but thou; and it behoveth thee speak my brotherfair and say to him, 'If thou have a mind to thy father'skingdom, it is thine, and thy brother shall be Viceroy for theein Damascus; for to this effect am I instructed by him.'" So theWazir went down from before him and made ready for his march. Then Zau al-Makan bade set apart a magnificent house for theFireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long isthe tale of that Fireman.[FN#380]  Presently Zau al-Makan wentout chasing and hunting and, as he was returning to Baghdad, oneof the Emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteoushandmaids whose description the tongue evades.  One of thedamsels pleased him: so he went in unto her and knew her thatnight, and she conceived by him forthright.  After a while, theWazir Dandan returned from his journey, bringing him news of hisbrother Sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him, andsaid, "It were fitting thou go forth to meet him." Zau al- Makanreplied, "I hear and I consent;" and riding forth with hisGrandees a day's journey from Baghdad, he pitched his pavilionsthere awaiting his brother.  Next morning appeared King Sharrkanamid the army of Syria, a horseman of might, a lion fierce infight, a prow and doughty knight.  As the squadrons drew nigh andthe dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with bannerson high, Zau al-Makan and those with him pushed forward to meetSharrkan and his men; and when Zau al-Makan saw his brother, hedesired to dismount, but Sharrkan conjured him not to do on thiswise, and himself footed it, and walked a few paces towardshim.[FN#381] As soon as he reached Zau al-Makan, the new Sultanthrew himself upon him, and Sharrkan embraced him and wept withgreat weeping and the twain condoled with each other.  Then theymounted and rode onward, they and their troops, till they reachedBaghdad, where they alighted and went up to the royal palace andthere they passed that night, and when next morning came, Zau al-Makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts, andproclaimed a Holy War and a Razzia.[FN#382] They then awaited thecoming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom, and everyone who came they entreated with honour and promised him allmanner of good; till in so doing a full month had sped, and thefighting men flocked to them in a continuous body.  Then Sharrkansaid to Zau al-Makan, "O my brother, tell me thy history." So hetold him all that had befallen him from first to last, includingthe benevolent dealing of the Fireman with him.  Asked Sharrkan,'Hast thou requited his kindness?"; and he answered, "O mybrother!  I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah!  I willrecompense him whenas I return from this raid"--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Eighty-eighth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkanasked his brother Zau al-Makan, "Hast thou requited the Firemanfor his kindness?"; and he answered, "O my brother, I have notrewarded him as yet, but Inshallah!  I will recompense him whenasI return from this raid and find time so to do." TherewithSharrkan was certified that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had toldhim the whole truth; but he concealed what had passed betweenthem and offered his salutation to her by her husband theChamberlain.  She sent him back her greeting, calling downblessings on him and enquiring after her daughter Kuzia-Fakan, towhich he replied that the maiden was well and in the best ofhealth and safety.  Where upon she praised Almighty Allah andgave him thanks.  Then Sharrkan went to his brother to takecounsel with him for departure; and Zau al-Makan said, "O mybrother, as soon as the army is complete and the Arabs have comein from all parts, we will march forth." So he bade make readythe commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to hiswife, who was now five months gone with child; and he put underher astrologers and mathematicians, to whom he appointed stipendsand allowances.  Then he set out three months after the arrivalof the army of Syria, and as soon as the Arabs were come in andthe troops were assembled from all directions; and, as he faredforth, he was followed by the warriors and the united host.  Nowthe name of the General of the Daylam army was Rustam and that ofthe General of the army of the Turks[FN#383] Bahram.  And Zau al-Makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brotherSharrkan, and on his left the Chamberlain his brother-in-law.  Sothe squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions andcompanies filed past in battle array, till the whole army was inmotion.  They ceased not to fare on for the space of a month, andeach body dismounted at its own ground and there rested everyweek three days (for the host was great); and they advanced inthis order till they came to the country of the Greeks.  Then thepeople of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort tookfright at them and fled to Constantinople.  But when King Afridunheard the tidings he arose and betook himself to Zat al-Dawahi,the same who had contrived the stratagem, and had travelled toBaghdad and had slain King Omar bin Al-Nu'uman; and who aftercarrying off her slaves and Queen Sophia, had returned with themall to her native land.  Now when she had been restored to herson, the King of Greece, and felt herself safe, she said to KingHardub, "Cool thine eyes; for I have avenged by blood the shameof thy daughter Abrizah, and have killed Omar bin al-Nu'uman andhave brought back Sophia.  So now let us go to the King ofConstantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint himwith what hath happened, that all of us be on guard and prepareour forces; and I will fare with thee to King Afridun, Lord ofConstantinople, for I opine that the Moslems will not await ourattack." Said Hardub, "Tarry thou till they draw near ourcountry, that we may make us ready meantime and assemble ourpower." Accordingly they took to levying their forces andpreparing for war, and, when the news of the Moslems' advancereached them, they were prepared for defence; and Zat al Dawahihad preceded them.  Now when she and her son arrived atConstantinople, the King of Kings, Afridun, hearing of theapproach of Hardub, King of the Greeks, came forth to meet himand asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit.  SoHardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother, Zatal-Dawahi, how she had slain the Moslem King and recovered fromhim Queen Sophia, and had said, "The Moslems have assembled theirforces and are on their way to attack us, wherefore it behoveththat we two join hands in single band and meet them." Now KingAfridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing ofKing Omar bin al-Nu'uman; and he sent to all countries seekingsuccour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying theMoslem King.  So the Nazarene troops flocked to him and threemonths were not past ere the army of the Greeks was complete,besides which there joined themselves to him Franks from alltheir lands, French, Germans[FN#384] and Ragusans,[FN#385] withmen of Zara,[FN#386] Venetians, Genoese, and all the hosts of theYellow Faces[FN#387]; and, when the gathering was at its full,earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude.  ThenAfridun, the Great King, ordered a march; so they set out andceased not to defile through the city for ten days.  They faredon till they reached the Wady highs Al-Nu'uman, a broad sidedvale hard by the Salt Sea, where they halted three days; and onthe fourth they were about to set out again, when news came thatthe army of Al-Islam on them press, and the defenders of thefaith of Mohammed, of Men the Best.  So they halted in it otherthree days, and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud whichtowered till it walled the whole land; nor was an hour of the daypast ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in thelift, and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lanceand the white levee of blades.  Presently there appeared beneathit the banners Islamitan and the ensigns Mahometan; the horsemenurged forward, like the letting loose of seas that surged, cladin mail, as they were mackerel-back clouds which the moon enveil;whereupon the two hosts clashed, like two torrents on each otherdashed.  Eyes fell upon eyes; and the first to seek combatsingular was the Wazir Dandan, he and the army of Syria,numbering thirty thousand bridles, and with him were the Generalof the Turks, and the General of Daylam, Rustam and Bahram, amidtwenty thousand horse, behind whom came the men from the shoresof the Salt Sea, clad in iron mail, as they were full moons thatpast through a night o'ercast.  Then the Nazarene host called outon Jesus and Mary, and the defiled[FN#388] Cross and they heapedthemselves upon the Wazir Dandan and those with him of the Syrianhost.  Now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised bythat ancient woman Zat al-Dawahi; for, before his departure, KingAfridun had gone in to her and asked her, "How shall I do andwhat plan shall I pursue?; it is thou hast caused this greatdistress to us;" and she had answered, "O great King and mightyCohen![FN#389] I will teach thee a trick would baffle Iblishimself, though he summon to his assistance all his grislyhosts."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased tosay her permitted say.              When it was the Eighty-ninth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, all this was astratagem of the ancient woman, for that the King before hisdeparture had gone to her and asked, "How shall I do and whatplan shall I pursue?  it is thou hast caused this great distressto us!" And she had answered, "O great King and mighty Cohen, Iwill teach thee a trick would baffle the Devil himself though hesummon to his assistance all his grisly hosts.  It is that thousend fifty thousand men going down in ships, and sailing over thesea to the Mountain of Smoke; and there let them land and stirnot till {he standards of Al-Islam come upon thee, when do thouup and at them.  Then bid the troops from the seaward sally outupon the Moslems and take them in rear, whilst we confront themfrom the landward.  So not one of them shall escape, and oursorrows shall tease and peace abide with us." Now the counsel ofthis ancient woman commended itself to King Afridun, and hereplied, "Right is the recking thou reckest, O Princess of witsand recourse of Kings and Cohens warring for their blood wit!" Sowhen the army of Al-Islam came upon them in chat valley, beforethey knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and theswords in men's bodies to make rents.  Then hurried up the armyof Baghdad and Khorasan who numbered one hundred and twentythousand horse, with Zau al-Makan in the front of war.  When thehost of the Infidels that lay by the sea saw them, they salliedout against them and followed in their tracks; and when Zau al-Makan espied this he cried out to his men, "Turn back to theInfidels, O People of the Chosen Apostle, and slay those who denyand hate the authority of the Compassionating, theCompassionate!" So they turned and fought with the Christians. Then Sharrkan marched up with another corps of the Moslem host,some hundred thousand men, whilst the Infidels numbered nigh upona thousand and six hundred thousand men.  When the Moslems wereunited, their hearts were strengthened and they cried out,saying, "Verily Allah hath pro mised us victory, and to theInfidels hath assigned defeat." And they clashed together withsword and spear.  Now Sharrkan tare through rank and row andraged among the masses of the foe, fighting so fierce a fight asto make children grey grow; nor did he cease tourneying among theinfidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edgedsword, shouting "Allaho Akbar!" (Allah is Most Great) till hedrove back the host to the coast.  Then failed the force of thefoe and Allah gave victory to the faith of Al-Islam, and folkfought folk, drunken without strong drink till they slew of theInfidels in this affair forty and five thousand, while of theMoslems but three thousand and five hundred fell.  Moreover, theLion of the Faith, King Sharrkan, and his brother, Zau al-Makan,slept not that night, but occupied themselves with congratulatingtheir braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuringthe army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in theworld to come.  Thus far concerning the Moslem; but as regardsKing Afridun, Lord of Constantinople and Sovran of Roum, and ZatAl-Dawahi, they assembled the Emirs of the host and said to them,"Verily, we had worked our will and solaced our hearts, but ourover confidence in our numbers, and that only, defeated us." Thenquoth to them the ancient one, the Lady of Calamities, "In verysooth nought shall profit you, except ye draw you nigh unto theMessiah and put your trust in the True Belief, for, by the virtueof the Messiah, the whole strength of the Moslem host lieth inthat Satan, King Sharrkan." "Tomorrow," said King Afridun, "Ihave resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out againstthem that redoubtable cavalier, Luka bin Shamlut; for if KingSharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed, our manwill slay him and will slay the other Moslem Knights, till notone is left.  And I purpose this night to sacre you all with theHoly Incense." When the Emirs heard these words they kissed theground before him.  Now the incense which he designated was theexcrement of the Chief Patriarch, the denier, the defiler of theTruth, and they sought for it with such instance, and they sohighly valued it that the high priests of the Greeks used to sendit to all the countries of the Christians in silken wraps aftermixing it with musk and ambergris.  Hearing of it Kings would paya thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for andsought it to fumigate brides withal; and the Chief Priests andthe great Kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium forthe eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic; and thePatriarchs used to mix their own skite[FN#390] with it, for thatthe skite of the Chief Patriarch could not suffice for tencountries.[FN#391] So, as soon as dawn was seen and the morningshone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spearsfull keen, and King Afridun,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn ofday and ceased saying her permitted say.                When it was the Ninetieth Night, She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, as soon as dawnwas seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, thehorsemen ran to their spears full keen and King Afridun summonedhis chief Knights and Nobles and invested them with dresses ofhonour; and, drawing the sign of the cross on their brows,incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skiteof the Chief Patriarch, the Cohen, the Heresiarch.  Thisincensing done, he called for Luka bin Shamlut, surnamed theSword of the Messiah; and, after fumigating him and rubbing hispalate with the Holy Merde, caused him to snuff it and smearedhis cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest.  Now therewas no stouter champion in the land of Roum than this accursedLuka, nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lungewith lance on the day of devoir; but he was foul of favour, forhis face was as the face of an ass, his shape that of an ape andhis look as the look of a malignant snake: his presence wasgrievouser than parting from the beloved make; and blacker thannight was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was hisbreath for foulness; more crooked than a bow was his crookednessand grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness, and he was brandedwith the mark of the Infidels on face.[FN#392] After this he cameup to King Afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him; andthe King said to him, "I desire thou go out against Sharrkan,King of Damascus, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and deliver us fromthis affliction." Quoth Luka, "Hearkening and obedience;" and theKing made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assuredof help from Heaven being near hand.  Then Luka went out from thepresence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse; he was cladin a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels, and he borea trident spear, as he were Iblis the damned on the day ofdrewing out his hosts war to darraign.  Then he rode forward, heand his horde of Infidels, even as though they were driving tothe Fire, preceded by a herald, crying aloud in the Arabic tongueand saying, "Ho, sect of Mohammed (upon whom be salutation andsalvation!), let none of you come out but your champion Sharrkan,the Sword of Al-Islam, Lord of Damascus in Sham[FN#393]!" Nor hadhe made an end of speaking, when arose a tumult in the plain; allthe people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of thearmies twain called to mind the Day of Complain.  Then thecowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound, and lo! it was King Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman.  For whenhis brother, Zau al-Makan, saw that accursed one push out on theplain, and heard the pursuivant, he turned to Sharrkan and saidto him, "Of a surety they seek for thee." Said he, "Should it sobe, 'twere most pleasing to me." So when they made sure of thematter and heard the herald crying in the plain, "Let none of youcome out against me save Sharrkan," they knew this cursed Luka tobe champion of the land of Roum who had sworn to sweep the earthclean of Moslems.  Now he was one of the greatest of villains, awretch who caused hearts to pain; and the DayIamites, Turks andKurds dreaded his might and main.  Presently Sharrkan crave athim like a lion angry grim, mounted on a courser like a wildgazelle flying snell and slim; and coming nigh to him made thespear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake, and recitedthese couplets,"I have a sorrel steed, whose pride is fain to bear the rein, *     Shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his     main:I have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point, * Upon     whose shaft the dam of Death her throny seat hath ta'en:I have a trenchant glaive of Hind; and, when I bare its face * Of     scabbard" veil, from out its brow the rays of levee rain."Luka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehendthe vehemence of the verse; but he smote his forehead with hishand, in honour of the Cross drawn thereon and kissed it; then hecouched his throw spear and ran at Sharrkan.  But first he tossedthe javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lostto the spectators' sight; and, catching it with the other hand asdo the jugglers, hurled it at Sharrkan.  It flew from his grasplike a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for Sharrkan;but, as the spear flew near him, he put out his hand and caughtit in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight. Then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nighbroken, and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappearedfrom view.  As it descended, he caught it again with the otherhand, in less than the twinkling of an eye, and cried out fromhis heart core, saying, "By the truth of Him who created thesevenfold skies, I will assuredly make this cursed wight a bywordfor mankind to despise!" Then threw he the throw spear at Luka,who thought to do as Sharrkan had done and put forth his hand totrend it in mid flight; but Sharrkan prevented him, and sped athim a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell onhis forehead, in the very centre of the sign of the Cross, andAllah hurried his soul to the Fire and Dwelling placedire.[FN#394]  But when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fallslain, they buffeted their faces and they cried, "Alas!" and "Woeworth the day!" and called for aid upon the Abbots of themonasteries,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceasedto say her permitted say.              When it was the Ninety-first Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theInfidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted theirfaces and cried, "Alas!" and "Woe worth the day!" and called uponthe Abbots of the monasteries and cried, "Where be the crosses?"So the Religious offered up prayers and the Christians all drewtogether against Sharrkan; and, brandishing their scymitars andlances, rushed forward to the attack.  Then army met army andbreasts fell under hoof, whilst spear and sword ruled the day andforearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed createdwithout legs;[FN#395] nor did the herald of-war cease calling tofight, till arms were aweary and day took flight and night cameon with darkness dight.  So the two hosts drew apart, whilstevery brave staggered like a drunken knave, for that with so muchcut and thrust they strave; and the place was choked with theslain; fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom theyfell.  Then Sharrkan joined his brother, Zau al-Makan, and theChamberlain and the Wazir Dandan, and said to them, "Verily Allahhath opened a door for the Infidels to fall, praised be the Lordof the Worlds one and all!" Replied Zau al-Makan, "Let us nevercease to praise Allah, for that He hath dispelled trouble fromthe Arab and the Ajam.  Indeed the folk, generation aftergeneration, shall tell of thy derring do against the accursedLuka, the falsifier of the Evangel;[FN#396] of thy catching thethrong spear in mid-flight, and how the enemy of Allah among menthou didst smite; and thy fame shall endure until the end oftime." Then said Sharrkan, "Harkye, O grand Chamberlain anddoughty Capitayne!" and he answered, "Adsum!"[FN#397] QuothSharrkan, "Take with thee the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousandhorse, and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea, and forcethe march till ye shall have come near the shore, and thereremain only two parasangs between thee and the foe.  Then ambushye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of theInfidels disembarking from their ships; and the war cry fromevery side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begunlabour between us and them; and, whenso ye see our troops fallingback, as if defeated, and all the Infidels following them, aswell those in front as those from the seaward and the tents, doye still lie in wait for them: but as soon as ye see the standardwith the words, There is no god but the God, and Mohammed isGod's Apostle (on whom be salutation and salvation!), then upwith the green banner, and do your endeavour and fall on theirrear and shout, 'Alla ho Akbar!  Allah is most Great!' and circleround that they may not interpose between the retreating army andthe sea." He replied, "To hear is to obey!"; and forthright theyagreed upon this matter and they went forth.  Now the Chamberlaintook with himself the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand men evenas Sharrkan had commanded.  As soon as dawned the morn, thetroops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear anddrawn the scymitar and slung the spear.  Then the Christiansdispread themselves over hill and dale and theEcclesiasts[FN#398] cried out and all heads were bared, and thosein the ships hoisted the Cross at their mast heads and beganmaking for shore from every side, and landed their horses and getthem ready for fight and fray, whilst the sword blades glitteredbright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirtwhite; and all joined fight and the grind mill of Death whirledround and ground those who fought from horse and aground: headsfrom bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew. Scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over thebattle plain; gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain;steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped rightsore; the host of Al-Islam called out, saying, "On the Prince ofMankind be blessings and peace, and to the Compassionate gloryand praise, which ne'er shall cease, for His boons which ayeincrease;" and the host of the Infidels shouted, "Glory to theCross and the Belt and the vine press juice, and the wine presserand the Priests and the Monks and the Festival of Palms and theMetropolitan!" Now Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan held back and theirtroops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy, whilethe Infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout,and made ready to foin and hew.  Then the meiny of the Moslemsraised their voices, reciting the first verses of the Chapter ofthe Cow,[FN#399] whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs ofsteeds, and the heralds of the Greeks cried out, "Ho, servants ofthe Messiah!  Ho, people of the True Faith!  Ho, followers of thePrimate![FN#400] Verily Divine grace upon you opes; for see, thehosts of Al Islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope! So turn ye not to them your backs, but let your swords cleavedeep in their necks and hold not your hands from them, else areye outcasts from the Messiah, Mary's son, who spoke even when acradled one!"[FN#401] Now Afridun, King of Constantinople, deemedthat the Infidels were victorious, knowing not that this was buta clever stratagem of the Moslems, and sent to King Hardub ofRoum congratulations on success, adding, "Availed us naught butthe Holy Merde of the Arch Patriarch, whose fragrance exhaledfrom the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the Cross nearand far; and I swear, by the Miracles of the Messiah; and by thydaughter Abrizah, the Nazarene, the Mariolater; and by the Watersof Baptism, that I will not leave upon the earth a singledefender of Al- Islam!  And to the bitter end will I carry outthis plan." So the messenger betook himself with the address toKing Hardub, whilst the Infidels called to one another saying,"Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!"--And Shahrazad perceived thedawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the Ninety-second Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that theInfidels called to one another, saying, "Take we vengeance wreakfor Luka!" while Hardub King of Greece cried aloud, "Ho, to ourrevenge for Abrizah!" Thereupon King Zau al-Makan shouted "Ho,servants of the Requiting King!: smite the children of denial anddisobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear!" Sothe Moslems returned to the Infidels and plied them with the keenedged scymitar, whilst their herald cried aloud, "Up, and at thefoes of the Faith, all ye who love the Prophet Elect, with hopeof salvation on the Day of Fear, to win favour of the Bountiful,the Forgiving One; for verily the Garden of Paradise is under theshadow of swords!" And behold, Sharrkan and his men charged downupon the Infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled andtourneyed among the ranks; when lo!  a knight of goodly presenceopened a passage through the army of Unbelievers and circledhither and thither amongst the Deniers, cutting and thrusting andcovering the ground with heads and trunks, so that the Faithlessfeared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew.  He wasgirt with two swords, his glances and his brand, and he was armedwith two lances, one of bamboo cane and the other his straightwand like shape; and his flowing hair stood him in stead of manywarriors, even as saith the poet,"Laud not long hair,[FN#402] except it be dispread * In two fold     locks, on day of fight and fray,O'er youth who bears his lance 'twixt flank and thigh, * From     many a whis kered knight to win the day."And as singeth another,"I say to him, what while he slings his sword, * 'For sword shall     serve those looks that sword like show!'Says he, 'My sabre looks for those I love, * My sword for those     who sweets of love unknow!'"When Sharrkan saw him, he said to him, "I conjure thee by theKoran and the attributes of the Compassionate One, O Champion ofthe Champions!  tell me who thou art: for verily by thy deedsthis day thou hast pleased the Requiting King, whom one thingdistracteth not from other thing; in that thou hast beendiscomforting the children of impiety and in rebellionrevelling." Then cried the Cavalier to him saying, "Thou art hewho madest brother covenant with me but yesterday: how quicklythou hast forgotten me!" Thereupon he withdrew his mouthveil,[FN#403] so that what was hidden of his beauty wasdisclosed, and lo!  it was none other than Zau al-Makan.  ThenSharrkan rejoiced in his brother, save that he feared for him therush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting; and this fortwo reasons, the first, his tender age and exposure to the evileye, and the second, that his safety was to the kingdom thegreater of the two overshadowing wings.  So he said to him, "OKing!  thou riskest thy life, so join thy steed to mine; in verysooth I fear for thee from the foe; and better thou stinthazarding thyself forth of these squadrons, that we may shoot atthe enemy thine unerring shaft." Quoth Zau al-Makan, "I desire toeven thee in fray and I will not be niggard of myself before theein the melay." Then the host of Al-Islam, heaping itself upon theInfidels, girt them on all sides, warred on them a right HolyWar, and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride andstowre.  But King Afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak thathad fallen on the Greek, and they turned their backs from fightand addressed themselves to flight, making for the ships, whenlo!  there came out upon them from the seacoast another host, ledby the Minister Dandan, the champion who was wont to makechampions bite the dust, and to lay load on them with cut andthrust.  Nor less came forth the Emir Bahram, Lord of theProvinces of Sham, amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm; andthe host of Al-Islam pressed them in front and on flank andwrought them grievous harm.  Then a body of the Moslems turnedagainst those who in the ships remained, and perdition on themrained, till they threw themselves into the main, and they slewof them many slain, more than a hundred thousand noblemen, norwas one of their champions, great or small, saved from bale andbane.  Moreover, they took their ships, with all the money andtreasure and cargo, save a score of keel, and the Moslems gotthat loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years; nor wassuch cut and thrust ever heard of by men's ears.[FN#404] Nowamongst the booty were fifty thousand horses, besides treasureand spoil past reckoning and arithmetic, whereat the Moslemsrejoiced with an exceeding joy for that Allah had given themvictory and protection.  Such was the case with them; but asregards the fugitive Infidels they soon reached Constantinople,whither the tidings preceded them that King Afridun had prevailedover the Moslems; so quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, "Iknow that my son Hardub, King of Roum, is no runagate and that hefeareth not the Islamitic hosts, but will restore the whole worldto the Nazarene faith." Then she bade the Great King, Afridun,give command that the city be decorated, and the people heldfestival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not thedecrees of Destiny.  Now whilst they were in the midst of theirrejoicings, behold, the raven of dule and downfall croaked overthem, and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the Kingof Caesarea.  So King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, met themon the sea shore, and they told him all that had befallen themfrom the Moslem, and they wept sore and groaned and moaned; andrejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal; and theyinformed him concerning Luka son of Shamlut, how calamity hadbetided him and how Death had shot him with his shaft.  Thereatthe horrors of Doomday rose upon King Afridun,[FN#405] and heknew that there was no making straight their crook.  Then came upfrom them the sound of weeping and wailing; the city was full ofmen mourning and the keepers were keening, and sighs and crieswere heard from all sides.  And when King Hardub of Greece metKing Afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flightof the Moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit, and said tohim, "Look not to see any of the army, save those who havealready reached thee." When King Afridun heard these words hefell down in a fainting fit, with his nose under his feet; and,as soon as he revived, he exclaimed, "Surely the Messiah waswroth with them that he caused the Moslems to prevail over them!"Then came the Arch Patriarch sadly to the King who said to him,"O our father, annihilation hath overtaken our army and theMessiah hath punished us!" Replied the Patriarch, "Grieve not norfeel concerned, for it cannot be but that one of you have sinnedagainst the Messiah, and all have been punished for his offence;but now we will read prayers for you in the churches, that theMohammeden hosts may be repelled from you." After which the oldwoman, Zat al-Dawahi, came to Afridun and said to him, "O King,verily the Moslem hosts are many, and we shall never overcomethem save by wile: wherefore I purpose to work upon them by guileand repair to this army of Al-Islam, haply I may win my wish oftheir leader and slay their champion, even as I slew his father. If my stratagem succeed in his case, not one of the host he leadsshall return to his native land, for all are strong only becauseof him; but I desire to have some Christian dwellers of Syria,such as go out every month and year to sell their goods, thatthey may help me (for this they can do) in carrying out my plan."Replied the King, "Be it so whenever thou wilt." So she badefetch an hundred men, natives of Najran,[FN#406] in Sham, and theKing asked them, "Have ye not heard what hath befallen theChristians with the Moslems?" "Yes," answered they; and herejoined, "Know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to theMessiah and purposeth to go forth with you, disguised asMonotheists and Mohammedans, to work out a device which shallprofit us and hinder the Moslem from us: say, then, are ye alsowilling to devote yourselves to the Anointed and I will give youa quintal of gold?[FN#407] He of you who escapeth shall have themoney, and him of you who dieth will the Messiah reward." "OKing," replied they, "we will devote our lives to the Messiah,and we will be thy sacrifice." Thereupon the old woman took allshe required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which sheboiled over the fire till the black essence of them wasextracted.  She waited till the decoction was cold, then dippedthe corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her facetherewith.  Moreover, she donned over her clothes a longgaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand arosary, and afterwards went in to King Afridun, who knew her not,nor did any of his companions know her, till she discoveredherself to them: and there was none in the assembly but whothanked and praised her for her cunning; and her son rejoiced andsaid, "May the Messiah never fail thee!" Thereupon she took withher the Syrian Christians, and set out for the army of Baghdad.--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying herpermitted say.              When it was the Ninety-third Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when KingAfridun heard these words, he fell into a fainting fit with hisnose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, fear flutteredthe scrotum[FN#408] below his belly and he complained to theancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi.  Now this accursed old woman was awitch of the witches, past mistress in sorcery and deception;wanton and wily, deboshed and deceptious; with foul breath, redeyelids, yellow cheeks, dull brown face, eyes bleared, mangybody, hair grizzled, back humped, skin withered and wan andnostrils which ever ran.  But she had studied the scriptures ofAl-Islam and had made the Pilgrimage to the Holy House of Meccahand all this that she might come to the knowledge of theMohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the Koran;and she had professed Judaism in the Holy City ofJerusalem[FN#409] for two years' space, that she might master themagic of men and demons; so that she was a plague of plagues anda pest of pests, wrong headed as to belief and to no religionfief.  Now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son, KingHardub of Greece, was on account of the slave virgins at hiscourt: for she was given to tribadism[FN#410] and could not existwithout sapphism or she went mad: so if any damsel pleased her,she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris againstclitoris and would anoint her with saffron[FN#411] till shefainted away for excess of volupty.  Whoso obeyed her she waswont to favour and make her son incline towards her; but whosorepelled her she would contrive to destroy; and so she abode fora length of time.  This was known to Marjanah and Rayhanah andUtrijah, the handmaids of Abrizah, and their Princess loathed theold woman and abhorred to lie with her, because of the rank smellfrom her armpits, the stench of her fizzles more fetid thancarrion, and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre. She was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means ofjewels and instructions; but Abrizah held aloof from her andsought refuge with the Omnipotent, the Omniscient; for, by Allah,right well quoth the poet,"Ho thou who grovellest low before the great * Nor over fording     lesser men dost blenchWho gildest dross by dirham gathering, * No otter scent disguises     carrion stench!And now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes ofher working.  Presently she departed, taking the chief Nazareneswith their hosts, and turned towards the army of the Moslems. Whereupon King Hardub went in to King Afridun and said to him, "OKing, we have no need of the Chief Patriarch nor of his prayers,but will consult my mother's counsel and observe what she will dowith her craft unending against the Moslem hosts; for these aremarching with all their power, they will soon be upon us and theywill encircle us on all sides." When King Afridun heard this,terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters, withoutstay or delay, to all the nations of the Nazarenes, saying, "Itbehoveth none of the Messiahites or Cross knights to hold back,especially the folk of the strongholds and forts: but let themall come to us, foot and horse, women and children, for theMoslem hosts already tread our soil.  So haste!  haste ye!  erewhat we fear to us here appear." Thus much concerning them; butregarding the work of the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi; when she wentforth from the city with her suite, she clad them in the clothingof Moslem merchants, having provided herself with an hundredmules carrying stuffs of Antioch, such as goldwoven satins androyal brocades and so forth.  And she had taken a letter fromKing Afridun to the following effect: "These be merchantmen fromthe land of Sham who have been with us: so it besitteth none todo them harm or hindrance, nor take tax and tithe of them, tillthey reach their homes and safe places, for by merchants acountry flourisheth, and these are no men of war nor of illfaith." Then quoth the accursed Zat al-Dawahi to those with her,"Verily I wish to work out a plot for the destruction of theMoslem." Replied they, "O Queen, command us whatso thou wilt; weare at thy disposal and may the Messiah never disappoint thydealings!" Then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbedher forehead, till she made a great mark as of a scar andanointed it with an ointment of her own fashion, so that it shonewith prodigious sheen.  Now the old hag was lean bodied andhollow eyed, and she bound her legs tightly round withcords[FN#412] just above her feet, till she drew near the Moslemcamp, when she unwound them, leaving their marks deeply embeddedin her ankles.  Then she anointed the wheels with dragon's bloodand bade her companions beat her with a severe beating, and sether in a chest and, quoth she, "Cry abroad the Refrain ofUnity,[FN#413] nor fear from it aught of damage!" Replied they,"How can we beat thee, who be our sovereign lady, Zat al-Dawahi,mother of the King we glory in?" Then said she, "We blame not nordeal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes, and in need evilbecometh good deed.  When ye have set me in the chest, take itand make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fareforth with it and the other goods through the Moslem camp, andfear ye no blame.  And if any of the Moslems hinder you, give upthe mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their King,Zau al-Makan, and implore his protection saying, 'We were in theland of the Infidels and they took nothing from us, but wrote usa passport, that none shall do us hindrance or work ourmischance.' If he ask you, 'What profit had ye of your propertyin the land of Roum?' answer him, 'We profited in the deliveranceof a pious man, who had been bound down in an underground cellnigh fifteen years, crying out for help yet none helped him. Nay, the Infidels tortured him night and day.  We knew not this;but, after we had tarried in Constantinople for some time, havingsold our goods and bought others in their stead, we determined onand made ready for a return to our native land.  We spent thatnight conversing about our journey and when day broke, we sawfigured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it,behold, it moved and said, 'O Moslems, is there amongst you onewho is minded to woo the favour of the Lord of the threeWorlds?'[FN#414] 'How so?' asked we; and the figure answered,'Know that Allah hath made me speak to you, to the intent thatyour faith be fortified, and that your belief embolden you andthat you may go forth of the country of the Infidels and repairto the Moslem host; for with them wones the Sword of the Compassionate One, of our Age the Champion, King Sharrkan, by whomHe shall conquer Constantinople town and destroy the sect of theNazarene.  And when ye shall have journeyed three days, you willfind an hermitage known as the Hermitage of the asceticMatruhina[FN#415] and containing a cell; visit it with pureintent and contrive to arrive there by force of will, for thereinis a Religious from the Holy City, Jerusalem, by name Abdullah,and he is one of the devoutest of mankind, endowed with the powerof working saintly miracles[FN#416] such as dispel doubts andobscurity.  Certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut himup in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time.  By hisdeliverance you will please the Lord of Faithful Men, for suchrelease is better than fighting for the Faith.'" Now when theancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words, shesaid, "As soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears ofKing Sharrkan, say him further, 'Hearing this from that image weknew that the holy man'"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of dayand ceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the Ninety-fourth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theold woman, Zat al-Dawahi, and those with her had agreed upon suchwords, she said, "Now as soon as that which I impart shall reachthe ears of King Sharrkan say him further, 'Hearing these wordsfrom that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of thechiefest devotees and Allah's servants of purest qualities; so wemade three days' march till we came in sight of that hermitage,and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying andselling, as is the wont of merchants.  As soon as day haddeparted our sight and night was come to darken light, werepaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon, and we heard theholy man, after chanting some verses of the Koran, repeat thefollowing couplets,'My heart disheartened is, my breast is strait, * And sinks my     soul in sea of bale and bateUnless escape be near I soon shall die; * And Death were better     than this doleful strait:O Lightning an thou light my home and folk, * An their still     brighter charms thy shine abate,Say, what my path to meet them, being barred * By wars, and     barricado'd succour's gate?'"When once ye have brought me into the Moslem camp, and I mixwith them you shall see," the old woman continued, "how I willmake shift to beguile them and slay them all, even to the lastman." The Nazarenes hearing whet she said, kissed her hands andset her in the chest, after they had beaten her with a grievousbeating in obedience to her commands, for they saw it wasincumbent on them to do her bidding in this; then they all madefor the Moslem host as hath erst been said.  Such was the casewith the damned hag, Zat al-Dawahi and her companions; but asregards the Mohammeden army, they indeed, after Allah had giventhem victory over their enemies and they had plundered everythingin the ships of money and hoards, all sat down to converse withone another and Zau al-Makan said to his brother Sharrkan,"Verily, Allah hath granted us to prevail because of our justdealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves; whereforecontinue, O Sharrkan, to obey my commandment, in submission toAllah (be He exalted and extolled!), for I mean to slay ten Kingsin blood revenge for my sire, to cut the throat of fifty thousandGreeks and to enter Constantinople." Replied Sharrkan, "My lifebe thy ransom against death!  Needs must I follow out the HolyWar, though I wone many a year in their country.  But I have, Omy brother, in Damascus a daughter, named Kuzia Fakan, whom Ilove heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and shewill soon be of age.' Said Zau al-Makan, "And I also have left mywife with child and near her time, nor do I know what Allah willvouchsafe me by her.  But promise me, O my brother, that if Allahbless me with a son, thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife tohim, and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon.""With love and good will, replied Sharrkan; and, stretching outhis hand to his brother, he said, If she bring thee a son, I willgive him my daughter Kuzia Fakan, to wife." At this Zau al-Makanrejoiced, and they fell to congratulating each other on thevictory over the enemy.  And the Wazir Dandan also congratulatedthe two brothers and said to them, "Know, O ye Kings, that Allahhath given us the victory, for that we have devoted our lives toHim (be He exalted and ex tolled!); and we have left our homesand households; and it is my counsel that we follow up the foeand press upon him and harass him, so haply Allah shall enable usto win our wishes, and we shall destroy our enemies, branch androot.  If it please you, do ye go down in these ships and sailover the sea, whilst we fare forward by land and bear the bruntof battle and the thrust of fight." And the Minister Dandanceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words whosaid,"To slay my foes is chiefest bliss I wist, * And on the courser's     back be borne a list;Comes promising tryst a messenger from friend * Full oft, when     comes the friend withouten tryst."And these words of another,"War for my mother (an I live) I'll take; * Spear for my brother;     scymitar for sireWith every shag haired brave who meets his death * Smiling, till     won from Doom his dear desire!"And when the Wazir ended his verses, he said, "Praise be to Himwho aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoilof silver and fine gold!" Then Zau al-Makan commanded the army todepart; and they fared on forcing their marches forConstantinople, till they came to a wide and spacious champaign,full of all things fair and fain, with wild cattle frisking andgazelles pacing to and fro across the plain.  Now they hadtraversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off fromthem, when they drew near this meadow and saw therein watersfounting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it wereParadise; for it had donned its adornments and deckeditself.[FN#417]  Gently waved the branches of its trees drunkenwith the new wine of the dew, and combined with the nectar ofTasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze.  Mind and gazerwere confounded by its beauty, even as saith the poet,"Behold this lovely garden!  'tis as though * Spring o'er its     frame her greeny cloak had spread.Looking with fleshly eyne, thou shalt but sight * A lake whose     waters balance in their bed,But look with spirit eyes and lo!  shalt see * Glory in every     leaf o'erwaves thy head."And as another saith,"The stream's a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed, * Whose down[FN#418]     is creeping shade of tamarisk stemsRound legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings * Silvern, and     blossoms are the diadems."When Zau al-Makan saw this champaign, with its trees bowing andits flowers blooming and its birds warbling, he called to hisbrother Sharrkan and said, "O my brother, verily in Damascus isnaught the like of this place.  We will not march from it saveafter three days, that we may take rest ourselves and that thearmy of Al-Islam may regain strength and their souls be fortifiedto encounter the blamed Infidels." So they halted therein andwhile camping behold, they heard a noise of voices from afar, andZau al-Makan asked the cause thereof, and was answered that acaravan of merchants from the Land of Syria had halted there torest and that the Moslem troops had come on them and had haplyseized something of the goods which they had brought from thecountry of the Infidels.  After a while up came the merchants,crying out and appealing to the King for aidance.  When Zau al-Makan saw this, he bade them be brought before him and, when inpresence they said to him, "O King, we have been in the countryof the Infidels and they plundered us of nothing: why then do ourbrothers the Moslems despoil our goods, and we in their own land? Of a truth when we saw your troops, we went up to them and theyrobbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to theeall that hath befallen us." Thereupon they brought out to him theletter of the King of Constantinople, and Sharrkan read it andsaid, "We will presently restore to you what hath been taken fromyou; but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to thecountry of the Infidels." Replied they, "O our Lord, in verysooth Allah despatched us thither that we might win whatGhazi[FN#419] never won the like of, not even thou in all thyrazzias." Asked Sharrkan, "What was it ye won?" "O King,"answered they, "we will not tell thee save in private; for ifthis matter be noised among the folk, haply it may come to theears of some,[FN#420] and this will be the cause of our ruin andof the ruin of all Moslems who resort to the land of the Greeks."Now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned Zat al-Dawahi.  So Zau al-Makan and his brother brought them to aprivate place, where they laid bare to both of them the story ofthe devotee, and wept till they made the two Kings weep.--AndShahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying herpermitted say.              When it was the Ninety-fifth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that theNazarenes who wore merchants' weed, when brought to a privateplace by Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan, laid bare to bothof them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the twoKings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by theold witch Zat al-Dawahi.  Thereupon Sharrkan's heart yearned tothe devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired withzeal for the service of Almighty Allah.  So quoth he to them,"Did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage?"Quoth they, "We delivered him and slew the hermit, fearing forour lives; after which we made haste to fly for dread of death;but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals ofgold and silver and stones of price." Then they fetched the chestand brought out the accursed old woman, as she were a cassiapod[FN#421] for excess of blackness and leanness, and she wasladen with the same fetters and shackles.  When Zau al-Makan andthe bystanders saw her, they took her for a man of the best ofAllah's devotees and surpassing in pious qualities, moreespecially because of the shining of her forehead for theointment wherewith she had anointed her face.  So Zau al-Makanand Sharrkan wept sore; then they rose up in honour and kissedher hands and feet, sobbing aloud: but she signed to them andsaid, "Cease this weeping and hear my words. Hereat they driedtheir tears in obedience to her bidding, and she said, "Know yeboth that I was content to accept what my Lord did unto me, for Ikenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from Him(be He exalted and extolled!); and whoso hath not patience undercalamity and tribulation, for him there is no coming to thedelights of Paradise.  I had indeed supplicated Him that I mightreturn to my native land, not as a compensation for thesufferings decreed to me, but that I might die under the horsehoofs of warriors fighting for the Faith who, being slain infray, live again without suffering death."[FN#422] Then sherepeated the following couplets,"Our Fort is Tor,[FN#423] and flames the fire of fight: * Moses     art thou and this is time for aid:Cast down thy rod, 'twill swallow all they wrought, * Nor dread     for men their ropes be vipers made.[FN#424]For Chapters read on fight day lines of foes, * And on their     necks 'grave versets[FN#425] wi' thy blade!"When the old woman had ended her verse, her eyes overflowed withtears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaminglight, and Sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food bebrought before her: but she refused it, saying, "I have notbroken my fast by day for fifteen years; and how should I breakit at such a time when my Lord hath been bountiful to me indelivering me from the captivity of the Infidels and removingfrom me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire? I will wait till sun down." So when it was nightfall, Sharrkanand Zau al-Makan came and served her with food and said, "Eat, Oascetic!" But she said, "This is no time for eating; it is thetime for worshipping the Requiting King." Then she stood up inthe prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent;and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days andnights, sitting not but at the time of the Salam orsalutation[FN#426] ending with several prayers.  When Zau al-Makan saw her on this wise, firm belief in her get hold of hisheart and he said to Sharrkan, "Cause a tent of perfumed leatherto be pitched for this Religious, and appoint a body servant towait upon him." On the fourth day she called for food; so theybrought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense ordelight the sight; but of all this she would eat only a sconewith salt.  Then she again turned to her fast and, as the nightcame, she rose anew to pray; when Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan,"Verily, this man carrieth renunciation of the world to theextreme of renouncing, and, were it not for this Holy War, Iwould join myself to him and worship Allah in his service, till Icame before His presence.  And now I desire to enter his tent andtalk with him for an hour." Quoth Zau al-Makan, "And I also:tomorrow we sally forth to fight against Constantinople, and weshall find no time like the present." Said the Wazir Dandan, "AndI no less desire to see this ascetic; haply he will pray for methat I find death in this Holy War and come to the presence of myLord, for I am aweary of the world." So as soon as night haddarkened, they repaired to the tent of that witch, Zat al-Dawahi;and, seeing her standing to pray, they drew near her and fell aweeping for pity of her; but she paid no heed to them tillmidnight was past, when she ended her orisons by pronouncing thesalutation.  Then she turned to them and after wishing them longlife, asked them "Wherefore come ye?", whereto they answered, "Othou holy man!  diddest thou not hear us weep around thee?" Sherejoined, "To him who standeth in the presence of Allah,remaineth no existence in time, either for hearing any or forseeing aught about him." Quoth they, "We would have thee recountto us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night, forthat will profit us more than the possession of Constantinople."Now when she heard their words she said, "By Allah, were ye notthe Emirs of the Moslems, I would not relate to you aught of thisat any time; for I complain not but to Allah alone.  However, toyou I will relate the circumstances of my captivity.  Know, then,that I was in the saintly City of Jerusalem with certainecstatics and inspired men, and did not magnify myself amongthem, for that Allah (be He exalted and extolled!) had endowed mewith humility and abnegation, till I chanced to go down to thesea one night and walked upon the water.  Then entered into mepride; whence I know not, and I said to myself, 'Who like me canwalk the water?' And my heart from that time hardened and Allahafflicted me with the love of travel.  So I journeyed to Roumland and visited every part for a whole year, and left no placebut therein I worshiped Allah.  When I came to this spot,[FN#427]I clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage, inhabited by amonk called Matrubina, who, when he sighted me, came out andkissed my hands and feet and said, 'Verily, I have seen theesince thou enteredst the land of the Greeks, and thou hast filledme with longing for the land of Al-Islam.' Then he took my handand carried me into that hermitage, and brought me to a darkroom; and, when I entered it unawares, he locked the door on meand left me there forty days, without meat or drink; for it washis intent to kill me by delay.  It chanced one day, that aKnight called Dakianus[FN#428] came to the hermitage, accompaniedby ten squires and his daughter Tamasil, a girl whose beauty wasincom parable.  When they entered that hermitage, the monkMatruhina told them of me, and the Knight said, 'Bring him out,for surely there is not on him a bird's meal of meat.' So theyopened the door of the dark room and found me standing in theniche, praying and reciting the Koran and glorifying Allah andhumbling myself before the Almighty.  When they saw me in thisstate Matrohina exclaimed, 'This man is indeed a sorcerer of thesorcerers!'; and hearing his words, they all came in on me,Dakianus and his company withal, and they beat me with a grievousbeating, till I desired death and reproached myself, saying,'This is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himselfon that which Allah hath vouchsafed to him, beyond his owncompetence!  And thou, O my soul, verily self esteem andarrogance have crept into thee.  Dost thou not know that prideangereth the Lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to theFire?' Then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my placewhich was the dungeon under ground.  Every three days, they threwme down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water; and everymonth or two the Knight came to the hermitage.  Now his daughterTamasil had grown up, for she was nine years old when I first sawher, and fifteen years passed over me in captivity, so that shehad reached her four and twentieth year.  There is not in ourland nor in the land of the Greeks a fairer than she, and herfather feared lest the King take her from him; for she had vowedherself to the Messiah and rode with Dakianus in the habit of acavalier, so that albeit none might compare with her inloveliness, no one who saw her knew her for a woman.  And herfather had laid up his monies in this hermitage, every one whohad aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit ittherein; and I saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewelsand precious vessels and rarities, none may keep count of themsave Almighty Allah.  Now ye are worthier of these riches thanthose Infidels; so lay hands on that which is in the hermitageand divide it among the Moslems and especially on fighters in theHoly War.  When these merchants came to Constantinople and soldtheir merchandise, that image which is on the wall spoke to them,by grace of a marvel which Allah granted to me; so they made forthat hermitage and slew Matruhina, after torturing him with mostgrievous torments, and dragging him by the beard, till he showedthem the place where I was; when they took me and found no pathbut flight for dread of death.  Now tomorrow night Tamasil willvisit that hermitage as is her habit, and her father and hissquires will come after her, as he feareth for her; so, if yewould witness these things, take me with you and I will deliverto you the monies and the riches of the Knight Dakianus which bein that mountain; for I saw them bring out vessels of gold andsilver to drink therefrom, and I heard a damsel of their companysing to them in Arabic and well-away!  that so sweet a voiceshould not be busied in chaunting the Koran.  If, then, ye will;enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming ofDakianus and his daughter; and take her, for she is fit only forthe King of the Age, Sharrkan, or King Zau al-Makan." Thereatthey all rejoiced with the exception of the Wazir Dandan, who putscant faith in her story, for her words took no hold on hisreason, and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in hisface.[FN#429]  Yet he was confounded at her discourse, but hefeared to speak with her for awe of the King.  Then quoth theancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, "Verily, I fear lest the Knight comeand, seeing these troops encamped in the meadow, be afraid toenter the hermitage." So Zau al-Makan ordered the army to marchupon Constantinople and said, "I have resolved to take with me anhundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain, where wewill load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage."Then he sent at once for the Chief Chamberlain whom they broughtinto the presence; and he summoned likewise the leaders of theTurks and Daylamites and said, "As soon as it is dawn, do ye setforth for Constantinople; and thou, O Chamberlain, shalt take myplace in council and contrivance, while thou, O Rustam, shalt bemy brother's deputy in battle.  But let none know that we are notwith you and after three days we will rejoin you." Then he choseout an hundred of the doughtiest riders, and he and Sharrkan andthe Minister Dandan set out for the hermitage, and the hundredhorsemen led the mules with chests for transporting thetreasure.--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceasedsaying her permitted say.              When it was the Ninety-sixth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkanand his brother, Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan set off withan hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by thataccursed Zat al-Dawahi, and they took with them mules and chestsfor transporting the treasure.  Now as soon as dawned the morn,the Chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure, andthey set out thinking that the two Kings and the Wazir were withthem; knowing not that the three had made for the monastery. Such was the case with the host, but as regards the two Kings andthe Minister, they tarried in their place till the end of thatday.  Now the Infidels who were with Zat al-Dawahi took theirdeparture privily, after they had gone in to her and kissed herhands and feet and obtained her leave to march.  So she not onlygave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wileand guile.  And when it was dark night, she arose and went in toZau al-Makan and his companions and said to them, "Come, let usset out for the mountain, and take with you a few men at arms."They obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of themountain, whilst the rest rode on before Zat al-Dawahi, whogained new strength for excess of joy, so that Zau al-Makan said,"Glory be to Him who sustaineth this holy man, whose like wenever saw!" Now the witch had written a letter to the King ofConstantinople and despatched it on the wings of a bird,[FN#430]acquainting him with what had passed and ending, "I wish thee tosend me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the Greeks andlet them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution, lestthe host of Al-Islam get sight of them; and, when they reach thehermitage, let them ambush themselves there, till I come to themwith the Moslem King and his brother, for I shall inveigle themand will bring them thither, together with the Wazir and anhundred horse and no more, that I may presently deliver to themthe crosses which be in the hermitage.  I am resolved to slay theMonk Matruhina, since my scheme cannot be carried out but bytaking his life.  If my plot work well, not one of the Moslemsshall return to his own country; no, not a living wight nor onewho blows the fire alight; and Matruhina shall be a sacrifice forthe followers of the Nazarene faith and the servants of theCross, and praise be to the Messiah, first and last." When thisletter reached Constantinople, the keeper of the carrier pigeonscarried it to King Afridun, who read it and forthwith inspectedhis host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses anddromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to thathermitage and, after reaching the tower, to hide therein.  Thusfar concerning them; but as regards King Zau al-Makan and hisbrother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan and the escort, when theyreached the hermitage they entered and met the Monk Matruhina,who came out to see who and what they were; whereupon quoth thatpious man Zat al-Dawahi, "Slay this damned fellow."[FN#431] Sothey smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup ofdeath.  Then the accursed old woman carried them to the place ofofferings and ex votos, and brought out to them treasures andprecious things more than she had described to them; and aftergathering the whole together, they set the booty in chests andloaded the mules therewith.  As for Tamasil, she came not, she orher father, for fear of the Moslems; so Zau al-Makan tarriedthere, awaiting her all that day and the next and a third, tillSharrkan said to him, "By Allah, I am troubled anent the army ofAl-Islam, for I know not what is become of them." His brotherreplied, "And I also am concerned for them: we have come by thisgreat treasure and I do not believe that Tamasil or any one elsewill approach the hermitage, after that befel which hath befallenthe host of the Christians.  It behoveth us, then, to contentourselves with what Allah hath given us and depart; so haply Hewill help us conquer Constantinople." Accordingly they came downfrom the mountain, while Zat al-Dawahi was impotent to opposetheir march for fear of betraying her deceit; and they faredforwards till they reached the head of a defile, where the oldwoman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse. As soon as these saw the Moslems they encircled them from allsides, couching lance and baring the white sabre blade; and theInfidels shouted the watch word of their faithless Faith and setthe shafts of their mischief astring.  When Zau al-Makan and hisbrother Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan looked upon this host,they saw that it was a numerous army and said, "Who can havegiven these troops information of us?" Replied Sharrkan, "O mybrother, this be no time for talk; this is the time for smitingwith swords and shooting with shafts) so gird up your courage andhearten your hearts, for this strait is like a street with twogates; though, by the virtue of the Lord of Arabs and Ajams, werenot the place so narrow I would bring them to naught, even thoughthey were an hundred thousand men!" Said Zau al-Makan, "Had wewotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse;"and the Wazir Dandan continued, "If we had ten thousand horsethey had availed us naught in these narrows; but Allah willsuccour us against them.  I know this defile and its straitness,and I know there be many places of refuge in it; for I have beenhere on razzia with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, what while webesieged Constantinople.  We abode in this place, and here iswater colder than snow.  So come, let us push out of this defileere the Infidel host increase on us and get the start of us tothe mountain top, whence they will hurl down rocks upon us, andwe powerless to come at them." So they began hurrying on to getout of those narrows; but the pious man, Zat al-Dawahi, looked atthem and said, "What is it ye fear, ye who have vowed yourselvesto the Lord, and to working His will?  By Allah, I abodeimprisoned underground for fifteen years, yet never gainsaid theAlmighty in aught he did with me!  Fight ye in Allah's way; sowhoever of you is slain Paradise shall be his abode, and whososlayeth, his striving shall be to his honour." When they heardfrom the ascetic these words, their care and anxiety ceased fromthem and they stood firm till the Infidels charged down from allsides, whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup ofdeath went round amongst them.  The Moslems fought for theservice of Allah a right good fight, and wrought upon His foeswith sway of sword and lunge of lance; whilst Zau al-Makan smoteupon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their headsfrom their bodies take flight, five by five and ten by ten, tillhe had done to death a number of them past numbering and anaccompt beyond counting.  Now while so doing, he looked at theaccursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them,and all who feared fled to her for shelter; but she was alsosigning the Infidels to slay Sharrkan.  So troop after trooprushed on him with design to do him die; but each troop thatcharged, he charged and drove back; and when another troopattacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in theirbacks; for he thought it was the devotee's blessing that gave himthe vic tory, and he said in himself, "Verily on this holy menAllah looketh with eyes of His favour and strengtheneth myprowess against the Infidels with the purity of his pious intent:for I see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me, butevery one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight." Sothey battled the rest of the day and, when night fell, theMoslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary withstress of war and cast of stone: and that day were slain of themfive and forty.  And when they were gathered together, theysought the devotee, but could find no trace of him; and this wasgrievous to them and they said, "Belike, he hath died a martyr."Quoth Sharrkan, "I saw him heartening the horsemen with divineinstances and using as talisman verses of Holy Writ." Now whilethey were talking, behold, the accursed old woman, Zat al-Dawahi,stood before them, hending in hand the head of the Chief Captainof the ten thousand horse, a noble knight, a champion fierce infight and a Satan for blight.  One of the Turks had slain himwith an arrow, and Allah hurried his soul to the fire; and whenthe Infidels saw what that Moslem had done with their leader,they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieceswith their swords, and Allah hurried his soul to Heaven.  Thenthe accursed old woman cut off that Knight's head and brought itand threw it at the feet of Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan and theWazir Dandan.  Now when Sharrkan sew her, he sprang up hastilybefore her and exclaimed, "Praised be Allah for thy safety andfor our sighting thee, O holy man and devout champion of theReligion!" Replied she, O my son, I have sought martyrdom thisday, and have thrown my life away amid the Infidel array, butthey feared me with dismay.  When ye dispersed, I waxed jealousfor your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight their leader,albeit he was a match for a thousand horse, and I smote him tillI severed head from trunk.  Not one of the Infidels could nearme; so I brought his head to you,"--And Shahrazad perceived thedawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.             When it was the Ninety-seventh Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when thedamned witch, Zat al-Dawahi, took the head of the Knight, theleader of the twenty thousand Infidels, she brought it and threwit down before Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and theWazir Dandan, saying, "When I saw your condition, I waxed jealousfor your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight and smote himwith the sword till I severed head from trunk.  And none couldnear me, so I brought his head to you, that you may bestrengthened in Holy War and work out with your swords the willof the Lord of the Faithful.  And now I purpose leaving you tostrive against the Infidels, whilst I go to your army, thoughthey be at the gates of Constantinople, and return with twentythousand horse to destroy these Unfaithfuls." Quoth Sharrkan,"How wilt thou pass to them, O thou holy man, seeing that thevalley is blocked up on all sides by the Miscreants?" Quoth theaccursed hag, "Allah will veil me from their eyes and they shallnot sight me;[FN#432] nor, if any saw me, would he dare to attackme at that time, for I shall be as one non existing, absorbed inAllah, and He will fend off from me His foes." "Thou sayestsooth, O holy man," rejoined Sharrkan, "for indeed I have beenwitness of that; so, if thou can pass out at the first of thenight, 'twill be best for us." Replied she, "I will set out atthis very hour and, if thou desire, thou shalt go with me andnone shall see thee.  Furthermore if thy brother also have a mindto go with us we will take him, but none else; for the shadow ofa saint can cover only twain." Sharrkan said, "As for me I willnot leave my comrades; but, if my brother will, there is no harmin his going with thee and setting us free of this strait; for heis the stronghold of the Moslems and the sword of the Lord of thethree Worlds; and if it be his pleasure, let him take with himthe Wazir Dandan, or whom else he may elect and send us tenthousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs." So afterdebate they agreed on this and the old woman said, "Give meleisure to go before you and consider the condition of theInfidels, if they be asleep or awake." Quoth they, "We will notgo forth save with thee and trust our affair to Allah." "If I doyour bidding," replied she, "blame me not but blame yourselves;for it is my rede that you await me till I bring you tidings ofthe case." Then said Sharrkan, "Go to them and delay not from us,for we shall be awaiting thee." Thereupon she fared forth andSharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said, "Were notthis holy man a miracle worker, he had never slain yonder furiousknight.  This is proof sufficient of the ascetic's power; and ofa truth the pride of the Infidels is laid low by the slaying ofthis cavalier, for he was violent, an evil devil and a stubborn."Now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of thedevotee, behold, the accursed Zat al-Dawahi came upon them andpromised them victory over the Unbelievers; wherefor they thankedher (not knowing that all this was wile and guile) and the damnedhag asked, "Where be the King of the Age, Zau al-Makan, and theMinister Dandan?" Answered he, "Here am I!" Take with thee thyWazir," said she, "and follow after me, that we may fare forth toConstantinople." Now she had acquainted the Infidels with thecheat she had put upon the Moslems, and they rejoiced withexceeding great joy, and said, Our hearts will not be contentedtill we shall have slain their King in return for the Knight'sdeath; because we had no stouter rider than he;" and they added(bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan offaring to the land of the Moslems), "When thou bringest him tous, we will bear him to King Afridun." Then she went out and wentout with her Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan, and she walkedon before the two saying, "Fare forth with the blessing ofAlmighty Allah!" So they did her bidding, for the shaft of Pateand Fortune of man's lot had shot them, and she ceased notleading them both through the midst of the Grecian camp, tillthey came to the defile, the narrow pass aforesaid, whilst theInfidel enemy watched them, but did them no hindrance; for theinfernal old woman had enjoined this.  Now when Zau al-Makan andthe Wazir Dandan saw that the Infidel host offered them no letand stay and yet had them in sight, the Wazir exclaimed, "ByAllah, this is one of the holy man's saintly miracles!  anddoubtless he be of the elect." Rejoined Zau al-Makan, "By Allah,I think the Infidels be naught but blind, for we see them andthey see us not." And while they were thus praising the holy manand recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers,behold, the Infidels charged down on them from all sides andsurrounded them and seized them, saying, "Is there anyone elsewith you twain, that we may seize upon him too?" And the WazirDandan replied, "See you not yon other man that is before us?  'Replied the Unbelievers, "By the truth of the Messiah and theMonks, and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save youtwo!" Then Zau Al-Makan said, "By Allah, this is a chastisementdecreed to us by Almighty Allah!"--And Shahrazad perceived thedawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.              When it was the Ninety-eighth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theUnfaithful had seized upon King Zau al-Makan and the WazirDandan, they said to the two, "Is there anyone else with youtwain, that we may seize upon him also?" And the Wazir Dandanreplied, "See you not yon other man who be with us?" Theyrejoined, "By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks and thePrimate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!" Then theInfidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard themduring the night, whilst Zat al-Dawahi fared on and disappearedfrom their sight.  So they fell to lamenting and saying to eachother, "Verily, the opposing of pious men leadeth to greaterdistress than this, and we are punished by the strait which hathbefallen us." So far concerning Zau al-Makan and the WazirDandan; but as regards King Sharrkan, he passed that night in thecavern with his comrades, and when dawned the day and he hadprayed the morn prayer, he and his men made ready to do battlewith the Infidel and he heartened them and promised them allgood.  Then they sallied out till they were hard upon theUnbelievers and, when these saw them from afar, they cried out tothem, saying, "O Moslems, we have taken captives your Sultan andyour Wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs; and except yeleave off fighting us, we will slay you to the last man; but anyou yield yourselves we will take you to our King, who will makepeace with you on condition that you quit our country and returnhome and harm us in naught, and we will do you no harm in aught. If ye accept, it will be well for you; but if ye refuse thereremaineth nothing for you but death.  So we have told you sooth,and this is our last word to you." Now when Sharrkan heard thisand was certified of the captivity of his brother and the WazirDandan, he was weighed down with woe and wept; his force failedhim and, making sure of death, he said to himself, "Would I knewthe cause of their capture!  Did they fail of respect to the holyman or disobey him, or what was the matter?" Then they sprang upto battle with the Unbelievers and slew great numbers of them. The brave was known that day from craven men, and sword and spearwere dyed with bloody stain; for the Infidels flocked up on them,as flies flock to drink, from hill and from plain; but Sharrkanand his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not todie, nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory, tillthe valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore. And when night fell the armies separated each making for his ownplace; and the Moslems returned to the cavern where gain and losswere manifest to them: few remained of them and there was nodependence for them but on Allah and the scymitar.  Now there hadbeen slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefestEmirs, and they had killed thousands of the Infidels, footmen andfighters on horse.  When Sharrkan saw this, the case was grievousto him and he asked his comrades "What shall we do?"; whereto allanswered, "That which Almighty Allah willeth shall befal us." Onthe morning of the second day, Sharrkan said to the remnant ofhis troop, "If ye go forth to fight, not one of you will remainalive and we have but little left of food and water; so I deem yewould do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at themouth of this cavern, to hinder any from entering.  Haply theholy man may have reached the Moslem host, and may return withten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the Infidels, forbelike the Unfaithful may have failed to see him and those withhim." They said, This were the better course to take, and of itsexpediency no doubt we make." So the troop went out and held thecavern mouth standing by its walls; and every one of the Infidelswho sought to enter in, they slew.  Thus did they fend off thefoe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported allsuch assaults, till day was done and night came on dusky anddun;--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased sayingher permitted say.              When it was the Ninety-ninth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the army ofthe Moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and theyfended off the foe, and every one of the Infidels attempted tocharge them, him they slew; and they patiently supported all suchassaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun, bywhich time King Sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no moreleft.  Then quoth the Infidels to one another, "When shall thesebattle days have an end?  We are weary of warring the Moslems."And quoth one of them, "Up and at them, for there remain of thembut five and twenty men!  If we cannot prevail on them to fight,let us light a fire upon them;[FN#433] and if they submitthemselves and yield to us, we will take them prisoners; but ifthey refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire, so shallthey become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire.  May theMessiah on their fathers have no grace, and may the sojourn ofthe Nazarenes be for them no abiding place!" So they carried fuelto the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it.  Thereupon Sharrkanand his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselvesprisoners.  And while they were in this condition, lo!  theknight their captain said to those who counselled theirslaughter, "It is not for any save for King Afridun to kill them,that he may gratify his wrath; therefore it behoveth us to keepthem in durance by us till the morrow, when we will journey withthem to Constantinople and deliver them to our King, who shalldeal with them as he please." Said they, "This is the rightcourse;" and he commanded to pinion them and set guards overthem.  Then, as soon as it was black night, the Infidels busiedthemselves with feasting and making festival; and they called forwine and drank it till all fell upon their backs.  Now Sharrkanand his brother, Zau al-Makan, were in confinement and so alsowere his companion knights; whereupon the elder turned to theyounger brother and said to him, "O my brother, how win free?""By Allah," replied Zau al Makan, "I know not; for here we belike birds in cage." Then Sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed forexcess of rage and stretched himself, till his pinion bonds brassasunder; whereupon being free he arose and went up to the Captainof the guard, and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters,freed Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the rest of his men. Then he turned to the two and said, "I desire to slay three ofthese Infidels and take and don their dress, we three; so that weshall be guised as Greeks and we will pass through them, with outtheir knowing us, and fare forth to our own force." Replied Zaual-Makan, "This is no safe counsel for if we kill them, I fearsome of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe bearoused upon us and kill us.  'Twere the surer way to pass out ofthe defile." So they agreed upon this and set out; and, when theyhad left the head of the strait a little distance behind, theysaw horses picketed and the riders sleeping: and Sharrkan said tohis brother, "Better we take each one of us a steed." There werefive and twenty horsemen, so they took five and twenty horses,whilst Allah sent sleep upon the Infidels for a purpose He knewand the Faithful mounted and fared on till they were out ofreach.  Meanwhile Sharrkan set to gathering from the Infidels asmany weapons, swords, and spears, as were wanted.  And while theytook saddle and struck forwards none of the Infidels supposedthat anyone could release Zau al-Makan and his brother and theirmen; or that their prisoners had power to escape.  Now when allthe captives were safe from the Unfaithful, Sharrkan came up withhis comrades, and found them awaiting his arrival, on coals offlame, expecting him in anxious grame, so he turned to them andsaid, "Feel no fear since Allah protecteth us.  I have that topropose which haply shall effect our purpose." "What is it?"asked they and he answered, "I desire that ye all climb to themountain top and cry out with one voice, 'Allaho Akbar!' and yeadd, 'The army of Al Islam is upon you!  Allaho Akbar!' This wisetheir company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out thetrick for they are drunk, but they will think that the Moslemtroops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingledwith them; so they will fall on one another brand in hand duringthe confusion of drunkenness and sleep, and we will cleave themasunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go roundamongst them till dawn." Replied Zau al-Makan, "This plan is notgood; we should do better to make our way to our army and speaknot a word; for if we cry out 'Allaho Akbar,' they will wake andfall on us and not one of us will escape." Rejoined Sharrkan, "ByAllah, though they should awake tis no matter, and I long that yefall in with my plan, for naught save good can come of it!" Sothey agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted, "AllahoAkbar!" And hills and trees and rocks reworded their Allaho Akbarfor fear of the Almighty.  But when the Kafirs heard this sloganthey cried out to one another,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawnof day and ceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the One Hundredth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkanspake thus, "I long that ye fall in with this my plan, for naughtsave good can come of it." So they agreed thereon and clomb themountain head and shouted, "Allaho Akbar!"; and hills and treesand rocks re worded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. The Infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned theirarmour and said, "The foe is upon us, by the truth of theMessiah!" Then they fell on one another and slew of their own menmore than any knoweth save Almighty Allah.  As soon as it wasdawn, they sought for the captives, but found no trace of them,and their captains said, "They who did this were the prisoners inour possession; up, then, and after them in all haste till yeovertake them, when we will make them quaff the cup of requital;and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you."So they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted butan eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them. Now when Zau al-Makan saw this, he was seized with increase ofterror and said to his brother, "What I feared would come, iscome upon us, and now it remaineth only for us to fight for theFaith." But Sharrkan preferred to hold his peace.  Then Zau al-Makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest,shouting, "Allaho Akbar!" and his men repeated the war cry andaddressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in theservice of the Lord of Faithful Men; and while they were in thiscase, behold, they heard many voices voicing, "There is no godbut the God!  God is most great!  Salutation and salvation uponthe Apostle, the Bringer of glad Tidings, the Bearer of badTidings!''[FN#434]  So they turned towards the direction of thesound and saw a company of Moslems who believed in one God,pushing towards them, whereat their hearts were heartened andSharrkan charged upon the Infidels crying out, "There is no godbut the God!  God is most great! he and those with him, so thatearth quaked as with an earthquake and the Unbeliever host brakeasunder and fled into the mountains and the Moslems followed themwith lunge and blow; and Zau al-Makan and his comrades of theMoslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the Infidel foe, andparted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming onstarkened sight.  Thereupon the Moslems drew together and passedthe night in congratulations, and, when morning dawned anddaybreak shone with its shine and sheen, they saw Bahram, thecaptain of the Daylamites, and Rustam, the captain of the Turks,advancing to join them, with twenty thousand cavaliers like lionsgrim.  As soon as they saw Zau al-Makan, the riders dismountedand saluted him, and kissed ground between his hands when he saidto them, "Rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of theMoslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of Unbelievers!" Thenthey gave one another joy of their deliverance and of thegreatness of their reward after Resurrection Day.  Now the causeof the coming of the succours to that place was this.  When theEmir Bahram and the Emir Rustam and the Chief Chamberlain, withthe Moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead, came in sight ofConstantinople they saw that the Nazarenes had mounted the wallsand manned the towers and the forts, and had set all theirdefenders in order of defence, as soon as they learned of theapproach of the host of Al-Islam and the banners Mohammedan, andthey heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices andtramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld theMoslems, with their standards and ensigns of the Faith of Unityunder the dust clouds and lo!  they were like a flight of locustsor rain clouds raining rain, and the voices of the Moslemschanting the Koran and glorifying the Compassionate One, strucktheir ears.  Now the Infidels knew of the approach of this hostthrough Zat al-Dawahi with her craft and whoredom,[FN#435]calumny and contrivance.  And the armies of Al-Islam drew near,as it were the swollen sea, for the multitude of footmen andhorsemen and women and children.  Then quoth the General of theTurks to the General of the Daylamites, "O Emir, of a truth, weare in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on thewalls.  Look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk likethe seas that clash with dashing billows.  Indeed yon Infideloutnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spieswho may inform them that we are without a Sultan.  In very sooth,we run danger from these enemies, whose numbers may not be toldand whose resources none can withhold, especially in the absenceof King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the illustriousWazir Dandan.  If they know of this, they will be emboldened toattack us in their absence and with the sword they willannihilate us to the last man; not one of us safety shall see. So it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of theallies and the Turks, and march them to the hermitage ofMatruhina and the meadow of Malukhina in quest of our brothersand comrades.  If thou act by my advice, it may be we shallapprove ourselves the cause of their deliverance, in case they behard pressed by the Infidels; and if thou act not, blame will notattach to me.  But, an ye go, it behoveth that ye return quickly,for ill suspicion is part of prudence." The Emir aforesaid fellin with his counsel; so they chose twenty thousand horse and theyset out covering the roads and making for the monastery abovementioned.  So much for the cause of their coming; but as regardsthe ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, as soon as she had deliveredSultan Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandaninto the hands of the Infidels, the foul whore mounted a swiftsteed, saying to the Faithless, "I design to rejoin the Moslemarmy which is at Constantinople and contrive for theirdestruction; for I will inform them that their chiefs are dead,and when they hear that from me, their joining will be disjointedand the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered. Then will I go to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, and to myson Hardub, King of Roum, and relate to them their tidings andthey will sally forth on the Moslems with their troops and willdestroy them and will not leave one of them alive." So shemounted and struck across country on her good steed all thelivelong night; and, when day dawned, appeared the armies ofBahram and Rustam advancing towards her.  So she turned into awayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked awhile saying to herself, "Haply the Moslem hosts be returning,routed, from the assault of Constantinople." However, as she drewnear them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standardswere not reversed,[FN#436] and she knew that they were coming notas conquered men, but fearing for their King and comrades.  Whenshe was assured of this, she hastened towards them, running atspeed, like a devil of ill rede, till reaching them she criedout, "Haste ye!  haste ye!  O soldiers of the Compassionate One,hasten to the Holy War against the hosts of Satan!" When Bahramsaw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and askedher, "O friend of Allah what is behind thee?" Answered she,"Question not of sad case and sore condition; for when ourcomrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of Matruhina,and designed to win their way Constantinople wards, thereuponcame out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the Infidels."And the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them withtrouble and terror, adding, "The most of them are dead, and thereare but five and twenty men left." Said Bahram, "O holy man! when didst thou leave them?" "But this night,"[FN#437] repliedshe.  He cried, "Glory be to Allah!  to Him who hath rolled upthe far distance for thee like a rug, so that thou hast sped thuswalking upon thy feet and props upon a mid-rib of palm-tree!  Butthou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired andpossessed by His directions."[FN#438]  Then he mounted his horse,and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from thebeldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies, and he said, "Thereis no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious,the Great!  Verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavywithin us, for our Sultan is a prisoner and those who are withhim." Then they cut across the country, wide and side, night andday, and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defileand saw Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan shouting.  "There is no god butthe God!  Allaho Akbar!  and Salutation and Salvation upon theCongratulator, the Comminator."[FN#439]  Whereupon he and hisdrove at the Unbelievers and whelmed them, as the rain torrentwhelms the waste; and cried out their war cries, till fear gethold of the prowess Knights and the mountains were cloven inaffright.  And when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen,the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant, and eachrecognised other as hath been said before.  Then they kissed theground before the King and before his brother Sharrkan, who toldthem all that had befallen the party in the cave.  Now thereatthey marvelled and said to one another, "Hasten we back toConstantinople, for we left our companions there, and our heartsare with them." So they hurried departure, commending themselvesto the Subtle, the All-wise, and Zau al-Makan exhorted theMoslems to steadfast- ness and versified in the followingcouplets,[FN#440]"Be praises mine to all praiseworthy Thee, * O Lord, who stinted     not mine aid to be!Though was I lost abroad, Thou west to me * Strongest support     which vouchsafed victory:Thou gav'st me wealth and reign and goodly gifts, * And slungest     con quering sword of valiancy:Thou mad'st me blest beneath Thy kingly shade, * Engraced with     generous boons dealt fain and free:Thou savedst *from every fear I feared, by aid * Of my Wazir, the     Age's noblest he!Garred us Thy grace in fight to throw the Greek, * Who yet came     back dight in War's cramoisie:Then made I feint to fly from out the fight; * But like grim lion     turning made them flee,And left on valley sole my foemen, drunk * Not with old     wine[FN#441] but Death-cup's revelry:Then came the Saintly Hermit, and he showed * His marvels wrought     for town and wold to see;When slew they hero-wights who woke to dwell * In Eden bowers     wherein sweet rill-lets well."But, when Zau al-Makan had made an end of versifying, his brotherSharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for thedeeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marchesto rejoin their army.--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of dayand ceased saying her permitted say.          When it was the One Hundred and First Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkancongratulated his brother, Zau al-Makan, on his safety andthanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set outforcing their marches to rejoin their army.  Such was their case;but as regards the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, after she hadforegathered with the hosts of Rustam and Bahram, she returned tothe coppice, where she took her steed and mounted and sped on atspeed, till she drew near the Moslem army that beleagueredConstantinople, when she lighted down from her destrier and ledit to the pavilion tent of the Chief Chamberlain.  And when hesaw her, he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with hisright hand and said, "Welcome O pious recluse!" Then hequestioned her of what had befallen, and she repeated to him herdisquieting lies and deluding calumnies, saying, "In sooth I fearfor the Emir Rustam, and the Emir Bahram, for that I met them andtheirs on the way and sent them and their following to relievethe King and his companions.  Now there are but twenty thousandhorse and the Unbelievers outnumber them; so I would have thee atthis moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed totheir suc cour, lest they be slain to the last man." And shecried to them, "Haste!  Haste!" When the Chamberlain and theMoslems heard these words, their spirits fell and they wept; butZat al-Dawahi said to them, "Ask aidance of Allah and bearpatiently this triburation; for ye have the example of those whohave been before you of the people of Mohammed; and Paradise withits palaces is laid out by Allah for those who die martyrs; andneeds must all die, but most praiseworthy is dying while fightingfor the Faith." The Chamberlain, hearing this speech of theaccursed old woman, called for the Emir Bahram's brother, aknight by name Tarkash; and, choosing out for him ten thousandhorse, riders famed for force, bade him set out at once.  So hefared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the nextnight, till he neared the Moslems.  When daylight dawned,Sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men ofAl-Islam and said, "If these troops which are coming upon us beMoslem men our victory is assured by them; but, if these beNazarenes, there is no gainsaying Destiny's decrees." Then heturned to his brother, Zau al- Makan, and said, Never fear, forwith my life I will ransom thee from death.  If these beMohammedan troops, then were it an increase of heavenly favours;but, if they be our foes, there is no help save that we fightthem.  Yet do I long to meet the Holy Man ere I die, so I may beghim to pray that I die not save by death of martyrdom." Whilstthe twain were thus speaking, behold, there appeared the bannersinscribed with the words, "There is no god but the God andMohammed is the Apostle of God;" and Sharrkan cried out, "How isit with the Moslems?" "All are sound and safe," replied they,"and we came not but out of concern for you." Then the Chief ofthe army dismounted and, kissing ground before Sharrkan, asked,"O my lord, how be the Sultan and the Wazir Dandan and Rustam andmy brother Bahram; are they all in safety?" He answered, "Allwell; but who brought thee tidings of us?" Quoth Tarkash; "It wasthe Holy Man who told us that he had met my brother Bahram andRustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us thatthe Infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you; but I seenot the case save the contrary thereof and that you arevictorious." They questioned him, "And how did the Holy Man reachyou?"; and he replied, "Walking on his feet and he had compassedin a day and a night, ten days' journey for a well girthorseman." "There is no doubt but that he is a Saint of Allah,"said Sharrkan, "but where is he now?" They rejoined, "We left himwith our troops, the folk of the Faith, moving them to do battlewith the rebels and the Faithless." Thereat Sharrkan rejoiced andall thanked Allah for their own deliverance and the safety of theHoly Man; and commended the dead to His mercy saying, "This waswrit in the Book." Then they set out making for Constantinople byforced marches, and whilst they were on this enterprise, behold,a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the twohorizons, the eastern and the western, from man's sight and theday was darkened by it to night.  But Sharrkan looked at it andsaid, "Verily, I fear lest this be the Infidels who have routedthe army of Al-Islam for that this dust walleth the world, eastand west, and hideth the two horizons, north and south."Presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness, blackerthan the blackness of dismal days; nor ceased to come upon themthat column more dreadful than the dread of the Day of Doom. Horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors ofthe case, when behold, they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid;so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out, "Opeople of the Best of Mankind,[FN#442] the lamp which shineth indarkness blind, verily the Infidels have outwitted the Moslems byguile, for they fell upon the host of the One God whilst theydeemed themselves safe from the Faithless, and attacked them intheir tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while theylooked for no wile; so hasten to the aid of the Believers in theunity of God, and deliver them from those who deny Him!" Now whenSharrkan heard these words, his heart flew from his breast withsore trouble; and, alighting from his steed in amazement, hekissed the Recluse's hands and feet.  On like wise did hisbrother, Zau al-Makan, and the rest of the foot and horse troops;except the Wazir Dandan, who dismounted not but said, "By Allah,my heart flieth from this devotee, for I never knew show ofdevotion to religion that bred not bane.  So leave him and rejoinyour comrades the Moslems, for this man is of the outcasts fromthe gate of the mercy of the Lord of the Three Worlds!  How oftenhave I here made razzias with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman andtrodden the earth of these lands!" Said Sharrkan, "Put away fromthee such evil thought, hast thou not seen this Holy Man excitingthe Faithful to fight, and holding spears and swords light?  Soslander him not, for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is theflesh of the pious.[FN#443]  Look how he inciteth us to fight thefoe; and, did not Almighty Allah love him, He had cast himaforetime into fearful torment." Then Sharrkan bade bring aNubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said, "Mount, O piousman, devout and virtuous!" But the devotee refused to ride andfeigned self denial, that he might attain his end; and they knewnot that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saith,"He prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy; * When once     his end is safely won then fast and prayer good     bye."[FN#444]So the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and thefootmen, like a wily fox meditating guile, and began to uplifther voice, chanting the Koran and praising the Compassionate One. And they continued pressing forward till they approached the campof Al-Islam, where Sharrkan found the Moslem in conquered plightand the Chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight,whilst the sword of Greece havoc dight among the Faithful, therighteous and those who work upright,--And Shahrazad perceivedthe dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.         When it was the One Hundred and Second Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that whenSharrkan saw the Moslems in conquered plight and the Chamberlainupon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dightamong the righteous and the workers of upright, the cause of thisweakness among the Moslems was that the accursed old woman, Zatal- Dawahi, the foe of the Faith, after seeing that Bahram andRustam had set forward with their troops to join Sharrkan and hisbrother Zau al-Makan, repaired to the camp of the Mahometansbefore Constantinople and caused the mission of the Emir Tarkash,as hath been before said.  In this her purpose was to divide theMoslem forces the better to weaken them.  Then she left them andentered Constantinople, and called with a loud voice on theknights of the Greeks, saying, "Let me down a cord that I may tiethereto this letter, and do ye bear it to your King Afridun, thathe may read it and to my son King Hardub that they both do whatis written therein of bidding and forbidding." So they let downfor her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport wasthe following: "From the terriblest of tribulations[FN#445] andthe chiefest of all calamities, Zat al-Dawahi, to King Afridungreeting.  But afterwards, of a truth I have contrived a devicefor destroying the Moslems; so bide ye quiet and content.  I havecozened and captured their Sultan and the Wazir Dandan; and thenI returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith, wherebytheir pride had a fall and their withers were wrung.  And I haveso wrought upon the host 'leaguering Constantinople that theyhave sent ten thousand men under the Emir Tarkash to succour thecapitves, of whom there be now left but few; it is therefore myobject that ye sally forth against them with all your power whilethis day endureth; and that ye fall on them in their tents andthat ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the lastman; for, verily the Messiah looketh down upon you and theBlessed Virgin favoureth you; and I hope of the Messiah that heforget not what deed I have done." When her letter came to KingAfridun, he rejoiced with great joyance; and, sending at once forKing Hardub of Greece, son of Zat al-Dawahi, read the letter tohim as soon as he came,whereathe was exceeding glad and said,"See my mother's craft; verily it dispenseth with swords, and heraspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the Day of Dread."Rejoined Afridun, "May the Messiah not bereave us of thyvenerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile!" Then hebade the Knights give orders for sallying outside the city, andthe news was noised abroad in Constantinople.  So the Nazarenesand the cohorts of the Cross burst forth and unsheathed theirkeen sabres in their numbers, shouting out their professions ofimpiety and heresies, and blaspheming the Lord of all Creatures. When the Chamberlain saw the sally, he said, "Behold, the Greekis upon us and they surely have learned that our Sultan is faraway; and haply they have attacked us, for that the most part ofour troops have marched to the succour of King Zau al-Makan!"Therewith he waxed wroth and cried out, "Ho, soldiers of Al-Islamand favourers of the True Faith, an you flee you are lost, but ifye stand fast, ye win!  Know ye that valiancy lieth in enduranceof outrance and that no case is so strait but that the Almightyis able to make it straight; Allah assain you and look upon youwith eyes of compassion fain!" Thereupon the Moslems cried out,"Allaho Akbar!" and the believer in the One God shouted hisslogan, and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting andthrusting in main and might; scymitars and spears played sore andthe plains and valleys were swamped with gore.  The priests andmonks priested it, tight girding their girdles and uplifting theCrucifixes, while the Moslem shouted out the professions of theRequiting King and verses of the Koran began to sing.  The hostsof the Compassion are One fought against the legions of Satan;and head flew from body of man, while the good Angels hoveredabove the people of the Chosen Prophet, nor did the sword ceaseto smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened. Now the miscreants had encompassed the Moslems and made sure ofescaping the pains that awaited them; and the Faithless greededfor victory over the Faithful until day dawned and dazzled. There upon the Chamberlain mounted, he and his men, trusting theeAllah would help them to victory; and host was mingled with hostand battle rose a foot and took post.  And heads flew from trunkswhilst the brave stood fast in stead; the craven turned tail andfled; and the Judge of death judged and sentence sped, so thatthe champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumberedmeadow and plain.  Then the Moslem began to give ground andrearwards bent; and the Greek took possession of some of theirtents; whereupon the Moslems were about to break and retreat andtake flight, when meanwhile behold, up came Sharrkan with therest of the host of Al-Islam and the standards of the Believersin Unity.  And having come up with them, he charged the Infidels;and followed him Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the EmirsBahram and Rustam with his brother Tarkash.  When the foe sawthis, they lost head and their reason fled, and the dust cloudstowered till they covered the country whilst the righteousBelievers joined their pious comrades.  Then Sharrkan accostedthe Chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness; and he inturn gave the Prince joy of his timely succour and his gainingthe day.  Thereat the Moslems were glad and their hearts wereheartened; so they rushed upon their enemies and devotedthemselves to Allah in their Fight for the Faith.  But when theIdolaters beheld the standards Mohammedan and there on theprofession of Faith Islamitan, proclaiming the Unity, theyshrieked "Woe!" and "Ruin!" and besought succour of thePatriarchs of the Monasteries.  Then fell they to calling uponJohn and Mary and the Cross abhorrent and stayed their hands fromslaughter, whilst King Afridun went up to consult King Hardub ofGreece, for the two Kings stood one at the head of each wing,right and left.  Now there was with them also a famous cavalier,Lawiya highs, who commanded the centre; and they drew out inbattle array, but indeed they were full of alarm and affray. Meanwhile, the Moslems aligned their forces and thereuponSharrkan came to his brother, Zau al-Makan, and said, "O King ofthe Age, doubtless they mean to champion it, and that is also theobject of our desire; but it is my wish to push forward thestoutest hearted of our fighters, for by forethought is one halfof life wrought." Replied the Sultan, "As thou wilt, O companionof good counsel!" "It is my wish," added Sharrkan, "to stand inmid line opposite the Infidel, with the Wazir Dandan on my leftand thee on my right, whilst the Emir Bahram leads the dexterwing and the Emir Rustam leads the wing sinistral; and thou, Omighty King, shalt be under the standards and the ensigns, forthat thou art the pillar of our defence; upon thee, after Allah,is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught thatcan harm thee."  Zau al-Makan thanked him therefor, and theslogan arose and the sabre was drawn; but, as things stood thus,behold, there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of Roum; and,as he drew near, they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced shemule, fleeing with her master from the shock of swords.  Herhousings were of white silk covered by a prayer-carpet of Cashmere stuff, and on her back sat a Shaykh, an old man of comelypresence and reverend aspect, garbed in a gown of white wool.  Hestinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near theMoslem and said, "I am an ambassador to you all, and anambassador hath naught to do save to deliver; so give me safeconduct and permit of speech, that I communicate to you mymessage." Replied Sharrkan, "Thou art in safety: fear neithersway of sword nor lunge of lance." Thereupon the old mandismounted and, taking the Cross from his neck, placed it beforethe Sultan and humbled himself with much humility.  Then quoth tohim the Moslems, "What is with thee of news?"; and quoth he, "Iam an ambassador from King Afridun, for I counselled him to avertthe destruction of all these frames of men and temples of theCompassionate One; and to him it seemed righteous to stay theshedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights inshock of fight singular; so he agreed to that and he saith toyou, 'Verily, I will ransom my army with my life; so let theMoslem King do as I do and with his life ransom his host.  And ifhe kill me, there will be no stay left in the army of Roum, andif I kill him, there will be no stability with the Moslems." WhenSharrkan heard this he said, "O monk, I agree to that, for it isjust nor may it be gainsaid; and behold, I will meet him induello and do with him derring do, for I am Champion of theFaithful even as he is Champion of the Faithless; and if he slayme, he will have won the day and naught will remain for theMoslems forces save flight.  So return to him, O thou monk, andsay that the single combat shall take place to morrow, for thisday we have come off our journey and are aweary; but after restneither reproach nor blame fear ye." So the monk returned (and herejoicing) to King Afridun and King Hardub, and told them bothwhat Sharrkan had said, whereat King Afridun was glad withexceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness, and hesaid to himself, "No doubt but this Sharrkan is their doughtiestswayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance; and when Ishall have slain him, their hearts will be disheartened and theirstrength will be shattered." Now Zat al-Dawahi had written toKing Afridun of that and had told him how Sharrkan was a Knightof the Braves and the bravest of knights and had warned himagainst him; but Afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought inmany a fashion; he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smitewith the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow.  Sowhen he heard the report of the monk that Sharrkan agreed to theduello, he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had selfconfidence and he knew that none could with stand him.  TheInfidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing;and, as soon as it was dawn, the two armies drew out with theswart of spear and the blanch of blade.  And behold a cavalierrode single handed into the plain, mounted on a steed of pureststrain, and for foray and fray full ready and fain.  And thatKnight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass madefor stress of fight.  On his breast he wore a jewelled mirror andin his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of Khalanjwood,[FN#446] the curious work of the Frank, weighing a quintal. Then the rider uncovered his face and cried out, saying, "Whosoknoweth me verily hath enough of me, and whoso knoweth me notright soon[FN#447] shall ken who I be.  I am Afridun theoverwhelmed by the well omened Shawahi,[FN#448] Zat al-Dawahi."But he had not ended speaking ere Sharrkan, the Champion of theMoslems, fared forth to meet him, mounted on a sorrel horse wortha thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled inpearls and precious stone; and he bore in baldrick a blade ofwatered Indian steel that through necks shore and made easy thehard and sore.  He crave his charger between the two hosts inline whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne, and hecried out to Afridun, "Woe to thee, O accursed!  dost thou deemme one of the horsemen thou hast overta'en who cannot standagainst thee on battle plain?" Then each rushed upon other andthey bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billowsdash ing and clashing: they advanced and retreated; and drewtogether and withdrew; and stinted not of fray and fight andweapon play, and strife and stay, with stroke of sword and lungeof lance.  Of the two armies looking on, some said, "Sharrkan isvictor!" and others, "Afridun will conquer!"; and the two ridersstayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamourand the bustle; and the dust columns rose and the day waned andthe sun waxed yellow and wan.  Then cried out King Afridun toSharrkan, saying, "By the truth of the Messiah and the Faithwhich is no liar, thou art nought save a doughty rider and astalwart fighter; but thou art fraudful and thy nature is notthat of the noble.  I ken thy work is other than praiseworthy noris thy prowess that of a Prince; for thy people behave to thee asthough thou wert a slave;[FN#449] and see!  they bring thee out acharger which is not thine, that thou mayst mount and return tothe fight.  But by the truth of my Faith, thy fighting irketh andfatigueth me and I am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee;and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night, thou wouldstnot change aught of thy harness nor thy horse, till thou approveto the cavaliers, thy generous blood and skill in brunt." WhenSharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folkbehaving to him though he were a slave, he waxt wroth and turnedtowards his men, meaning to sign to them and bid them not preparehim change of harness or horse, when lo!  Afridun shook his throwspear high in air and cast it at Sharrkan.  Now when the Moslemturned his back, he found none of the men near him, and he knewthis to be a trick of the accursed Infidel; so he wheeled roundin haste and behold, the javelin came at him, so he swerved fromit, till his head was bent low as his saddle bow.  The weapongrazed his breast, and pierced the skin of his chest, forSharrkan was high bosomed: whereupon he gave one cry and swoonedaway.  Thereat the accursed Afridun was joyful, thinking he hadslain him; and shouted to the Infidels bidding them rejoice,whereat the Faithless were encouraged and the Faithful wept. When Zau al-Makan saw his brother reeling in selle so that hewell nigh fell, he despatched cavaliers towards him and thebraves hurried to his aid and came up with him.  Thereupon theInfidels drove at the Moslems; the two hosts joined battle andthe two lines were mingled, whilst the keen scymitar of Al-Yamandid good work.  Now the first to reach Sharrkan was the WazirDandan,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased tosay her permitted say.          When it was the One Hundred and Third Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when KingZau al-Makan saw that the accursed Infidel had struck withjavelin his brother Sharrkan, he deemed him dead, and despatchedcavaliers towards him; and the first to reach him were the WazirDandan and the Emir of the Turks, Bahram, and the Emir of theDaylamites, Rustam.  They found him falling from his horse; sothey stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to hisbrother, Zau al-Makan; then they gave him in charge to his pages,and went again to do the work of cut and thrust.  So the striferedoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bateand debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necksbowing; nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make playnor the strife to rage with more and more affray, till the mostpart of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary ofthe mellay.  So they called a truce and each army returned to itstents, whilst all the Infidels repaired to King Afridun andkissed the ground before him, and the priests and monks wishedhim joy of his victory over Sharrkan.  Then the King fared forConstantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm, when KingHardub came to him and said, "May the Messiah strengthen thy forearm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayersmy pious mother, Zat al-Dawahi, shall pray for thee!  Know thatthe Moslems can make no stay without Sharrkan." Replied Afridun,"To morrow shall end the affair when to fight I fare: I will seekZau al-Makan and slay him, and their army shall turn tail and offlight shall avail." Such was the case with the Kafirs; but asregards the host of Al-Islam, when Zau al-Makan returned to histent, he thought of naught but his brother and, going into thepavilion, found him in evil case and sore condition; whereupon hesummoned for counsel the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and Bahram. When they entered, they opined to assemble the physicians thatthey might medicine Sharrkan, and they wept and said, "The worldwill not readily afford his like!" and they watched by him allthat night, and about the later hours came to them the Recluse intears.  When Zau al-Makan saw him, he rose in honour; and theReligious stroked Sharrkan's wound with his hand, chantingsomewhat of the Koran and repeating by way of talisman some ofthe verses of the Compassionate One.  And the pretender ceasednot to watch over him till dawn, when he came to himself and,opening his eyes, moved his tongue in his mouth and spake.  Atthis Zau al-Makan rejoiced, saying, "Of a truth the blessing ofthe Holy Man hath taken effect on him!" And Sharrkan said,"Praised be Allah for recovery; indeed, I am well at this hour. That accursed one played me false; and, but that I swerved asidelighter than lightening, the throw spear had pierced through mybreast.  So praised be Allah for saving me!  And how is it withthe Moslems?" Answered Zau al-Makan, "All are weeping for thee."Quoth Sharrkan, "I am well and in good case; but where is theHoly Man?" Now he was sitting by him and said, "At thy head." Sothe Prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said, "O myson!  Be of good patience and Allah shall increase thy reward;for the wage is measured by the work." Sharrkan rejoined, "Prayfor me," and he prayed for him.  As soon as morning dawned andday brake in shine and sheen, the Moslems sallied out to theplain and the Kafirs made ready to thrust and cut.  Then theIslamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons readydight, and King Zau al-Makan and Afridun made to charge one atother.  But when Zau al-Makan fared forth into the field, therecame with him the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Bahram,saying, "We will be thy sacrifice." He replied, "By the HolyHouse and Zemzem and the Place![FN#450]  I will not be stayedfrom going forth against these wild asses." And when he rode outinto the field he played with sword and spear till ridersmarvelled and both armies wondered; then he rushed upon the foe'sright wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealtwith the left wing.  Presently he stayed his steed in the midstof the field and cried out, "Where is Afridun, that I may makehim taste the cup of disgrace?" But when King Hardub saw the casehe conjured Afridun not to attack him, saying, "O King, yesterdayit was thy turn to fight: it is mine to day.  I care naught forhis prowess." So he rushed out towards Zau al-Makan brand in handand under him a stallion like Abjar, which was Antar's chargerand its coat was jet black even as saith the poet,"On the glancing racer outracing glance * He speeds, as though he     would collar Doom:His steed's black coat is of darkest jet, * And likest Night in     her nightliest gloom:Whose neigh sounds glad to the hearer's ears * Like thunders     rolling in thun d'rous boom:If he race the wind he will lead the way, * And the lightning     flash will behind him loom.''[FN#451]Then each rushed upon the opponent, parrying blows and provingthe marvellous qualities were stored in him; and they fell todrawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanderswere straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event.  Atlast Zau al-Makan cried out his war cry and rushed upon Hardub,King of Caesarea,[FN#452] and struck him a stroke that shore headfrom trunk and slew him on the spot.  When the Infidels saw this,they charged in a body, compact and united, upon Zau al-Makan,who met them amidfield, and they engaged in hewing and foining,till blood ran in rills.  Then the Moslems cried out, "AllahoAkbar!" (God is most Great) and "There is no god but the God!",and invoked salvation for the Prophet, the Bringer of GladTidings, the Bearer of Bad Tidings.  And there befel a greatfight, but Allah assigned victory to the Faithful and defeat tothe Faithless.  The Wazir Dandan shouted, "Take your bloodrevenge for King Omar bin al Nu'uman and his son Sharrkan!"; andbared his head and cried out to the Turks.  Now there were by hisside more than twenty thousand horse, and all charged with him asmen, when the Faithless found naught to save their lives butflight.  So they turned tail to fly while the biting sabrewrought its havoc and the Moslems slew of them that day somefifty thousand horse and took more than that number: much folkalso were slain while going in at the gates, for the flock wasgreat.  Then the Greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up thewalls to await the assault; and in fine the Moslem hosts returnedto their tents aided to glory and victory, and King Zau al-Makanwent in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case.  So hemade a prostration of thanks to the Bountiful and the Exalted;and then he came forward and gave Sharrkan joy of his recovery. Answered he, "Verily we are all under the benediction of thisReligious, holy and righteous, nor would you have beenvictorious, but for his accepted orisons; indeed all day heremained at prayer to invoke victory on the Moslems."--AndShahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying herpermitted say.         When it was the One Hundred and Fourth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Zaual- Makan went in to his brother Sharrkan, he found him sittingwith the Holy Man by his side; so he rejoiced and drew near himand gave him joy of his recovery.  Answered he, "Verily we areall under the benediction of this Recluse nor would you have beenvictorious but for his prayers, indeed he felt no fear this dayand he ceased not supplication for the Moslems.  I found strengthreturn to me, when I heard your 'Allaho Akbar,' for then I knewyou to be victorious over your enemies.  But now recount to me, Omy brother, what befel thee." So he told him all that had passedbetween him and the accursed Hardub and related how he had slainhim and sent him to the malediction of Allah; and Sharrkanpraised him and thanked him for his prowess.  When Zat al-Dawahiheard tell of her son's death (and she still drest as a devotee),her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears:she kept her counsel, however, and feigned to the Moslems thatshe was glad and wept for excess of joy.  But she said toherself, "By the truth of the Messiah, there remaineth no profitof my life, if I burn not his heart for his brother, Sharrkan,even as he hath burned my heart for King Hardub, the mainstay ofChristendom and the hosts of Crossdom!" Still she kept hersecret.  And the Wazir Dandan and King Zau al-Makan and theChamberlain remained sitting with Sharrkan till they had dressedand salved his wound; after which they gave him medicines and hebegan to recover strength; whereat they joyed with exceeding joyand told the troops who congratulated themselves, saying, "Tomorrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege."Then said Sharrkan to them, "Ye have fought through all this dayand are aweary of fight; so it behoveth that you return to yourplaces and sleep and not sit up." They accepted his counsel andthen each went away to his own pavilion, and none remained withSharrkan but a few servants and the old woman Zat al-Dawahi.  Hetalked with her through part of the night, then he stretchedhimself to rest: and his servants did likewise and presentlysleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead.  Such was thecase with Sharrkan and his men; but as regards the old woman shealone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and, lookingat Sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep. Thereupon she sprang to her feet, as she were a scald she bear ora speckled snake, and drew from her waist cloth a dagger sopoisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock.  Thenshe unsheathed the poniard and went up to Sharrkan's head and shedrew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand andhewed off his head from his body.  And once more she sprang toher feet; and, going the round of the sleeping servants, she cutoff their heads also, lest they should awake.  Then she left thetent and made for the Sultan's pavilion, but finding the guardson the alert, turned to that of the Wazir Dandan.  Now she foundhim reading the Koran and when his sight fell upon her he said,"Welcome to the Holy Man!" Hearing this from the Wazir, her hearttrembled and she said, "The reason of my coming hither at thistime is that I heard the voice of a saint amongst Allah's Saintsand am going to him." Then she turned her back, but the Wazirsaid to himself, "By Allah, I will follow our Devotee thisnight!" So he rose and walked after her; but when the accursedold woman sensed his footsteps, she knew that he was followingher: wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said inherself, "Unless I serve some trick upon him he will disgraceme." So she turned and said to him from afar, "Ho, thou Wazir, Iam going in search of this Saint that I may learn who he is; and,after learning this much, I will ask his leave for thee to visithim.  Then I will come back and tell thee: for I fear thineaccompanying me, without having his permission, lest he takeumbrage at me seeing thee in my society." Now when the Wazirheard these words, he was ashamed to answer her; so he left herand returned to his tent, and would have slept; but sleep was notfavourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him. Presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself,"I will go to Sharrkan and chat with him till morning." But whenhe entered into Sharrkan's pavilion, he found the blood runninglike an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throatscut like beasts for food.  At this he cried a cry which arousedall who were asleep; the folk hastened to him and, seeing theblood streaming, set up a clamour of weeping and wailing.  Thenthe noise awoke the Sultan, who enquired what was the matter, andit was said to him, "Sharrkan thy brother and his servants aremurthered." So he rose in haste and entered the tent, and foundthe Wazir Dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brother's bodywithout a head.  Thereat he swooned away and all the troopscrowded around him, weeping and crying out, and so remained for awhile, till he came to himself, when he looked at Sharrkan andwept with sore weeping, while the Wazir and Rustam and Bahram didthe like.  But the Chamberlain cried and lamented more than therest and asked leave to absent himself, such was his alarm.  Thensaid Zau al-Makan, "Know ye who did this deed and how is it I seenot the Devotee, him who the things of this world hath put away?"Quoth the Wazir, "And who should have been the cause of thisaffliction, save that Devotee, that Satan?  By Allah, my heartabhorred him from the first, because I know that all who pretendto be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous!"And he repeated to the King the tale of how he would havefollowed the Religious, but he forbade him, whereupon the folkbroke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbledthemselves before Him who is ever near, Him who ever answerethprayer, supplicating that He would cause the false Devotee whodenied Allah's testimony to fall into their hands.  Then theylaid Sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid andmourned over his far-famed virtues.--And Shahrazad perceived thedawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.          When it was the One Hundred and Fifth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they laidSharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mournedover his far-famed virtues.  Then they looked for the opening ofthe city gate; but it opened not and no sign of men appeared tothem on the walls; whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder. But King Zau al-Makan said, "By Allah, I will not turn back fromthem, though I sit here for years and years, till I take bloodrevenge for my brother Sharrkan and waste Constantinople and killthe King of the Nazarenes, even if death overcome me and I be atrest from this woeful world!" Then he bade be brought out thetreasure taken from the Monastery of Matruhina; and mustered thetroops and divided the monies among them, and he left not one ofthem but he gave him gifts which contented him.  Moreover, heassembled in the presence three hundred horse of every divisionand said to them, "Do ye send supplies to your households, for Iam resolved to abide by this city, year after year, till I havetaken man bote for my brother Sharrkan, even if I die in thisstead." And when the army heard these words and had received hisgifts of money they replied, "To hear is to obey!" Thereupon hesummoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them todeliver the same, together with the monies, to the soldiers'families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied, andacquaint them saying, "We are encamped before Constantinople andwe will either destroy it or die; and, albeit we be obliged toabide here months and years, we will not depart hence till wetake it." Moreover, he bade the Wazir Dandan write to his sister,Nuzhat al-Zaman, and said to him, "Acquaint her with what hathbefallen us, and what be our situation and commend my child toher care since that, when I went out to war, my wife was near herdelivery and by this time she must needs have been brought tobed; and if she hath given birth to a boy, as I have heard say,hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news." Then hegave them somewhat of money, which they pouched and set out atonce; and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them andentrust them with the monies and the messages.  After they haddeparted, Zau al-Makan turned to the Wazir Dandan and commandedhim to advance with the army against the city walls.  So thetroops pushed forward, but found none on the ramparts, whereatthey marvelled, while Zau al-Makan was troubled at the case, forhe deeply mourned the severance from his brother Sharrkan and hewas sore perturbed about that traitor the Ascetic.  In thiscondition they abode three days without seeing anyone.  So farconcerning the Moslems; but as regards the Greeks and the causeof their refusing to fight during these three days the case wasthis.  As soon as Zat al-Dawahi had slain Sharrkan, she hastenedher march and reached the walls of Constantinople, where shecalled out in the Greek tongue to the guards to throw her down arope.  Quoth they, "Who art thou?"; and quoth she, "I am Zat al-Dawahi." They knew her and let down a cord to which she tiedherself and they drew her up; and, when inside the city, she wentin to the King Afridun and said to him, "What is this I hear fromthe Moslems?  They say that my son King Hardub is slain." Heanswered, "Yes;" and she shrieked out and wept right grievouslyand ceased not weeping thus till she made Afridun and all whowere present weep with her.  Then she told the King how she hadslain Sharrkan and thirty of his servants, whereat he rejoicedand thanked her; and, kissing her hands, exhorted her toresignation for the loss of her son.  Said she, "By the truth ofthe Messiah, I will not rest content with killing that dog of theMoslem dogs in blood revenge for my son, a King of the Kings ofthe age!  Now there is no help for it but that I work some guileand I contrive a wile whereby to slay the Sultan Zau al-Makan andthe Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram andten thousand cavaliers of the army of Al-Islam; for it shallnever be said that my son's head be paid with the bloodwit ofSharrkan's head; no, never!" Then said she to King Afridun,"Know, O King of the Age, that it is my wish to set forthmourning for my son and to cut my Girdle and to break theCrosses." Replied Afridun, "Do what thou desire; I will notgainsay thee in aught.  And if thou prolong thy mourning for manydays it were a little thing; for though the Moslems resolve tobeleaguer us years and years, they will never win their will ofus nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness." Then theAccursed One (when she had ended with the calamity she hadwrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought) tookink case and paper and wrote thereon: "From Shawahi, Zat al-Dawahi, to the host of the Moslems.  Know ye that I entered yourcountry and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand Islew your King Omar bin al-Nu'uman in the midst of his palace. Moreover, I slew, in the affair of the mountain pass and of thecave, many of your men; and the last I killed were Sharrkan andhis servants.  And if fortune do not stay me and Satan obey me, Ineeds must slay me your Sultan and the Wazir Dandan, for I am shewho came to you in disguise of a Recluse and who heaped upon youmy devices and deceits.  Wherefore, an you would be in safetyafter this, fare ye forth at once; and if you seek your owndestruction cease not abiding for the nonce; and though ye tarryhere years and years, ye shall not do your desire on us.  And sopeace be yours!" After writing her writ she devoted three days tomourning for King Hardub; arid, on the fourth, she called aKnight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaftand shoot it into the Moslem camp.  When this was done, sheentered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing forthe loss of her son, saying to him who took the kingship afterhim, "Nothing will serve me but I must kill Zau al-Makan and allthe nobles of Al-Islam." Such was the case with her; but asregards what occurred to the Moslems, all passed three days introuble and anxiety, and on the fourth when gazing at the wallsbehold, they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot anarrow along whose side a letter was bound.  So they waited tillhe had shot it among them and the Sultan bade the Wazir Dandantake the missive and read it.  He perused it accordingly; and,when Zau al-Makan heard it to end and understood its purport, hiseyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy;and the Minister Dandan said, "By Allah, my heart shrank fromher!" Quoth the Sultan, "How could this whore play her tricksupon us twice?  But by the Almighty I will not depart hence tillI fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailingof a bird encaged, then bind her with her own hair and crucifyher over the gate of Constantinople." And he called to mind hisbrother and wept with excessive weeping.  But when Zat al-Dawahiarrived amongst the Infidels and related to them her adventuresat length, they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying ofSharrkan.  There upon the Moslems addressed themselves again tothe siege of the city and the Sultan promised his men that, if itshould be taken, he would divide its treasures among them inequal parts.  But he dried not his tears grieving for his brothertill his body was wasted and sick, growing thin as a tooth pick. Presently the Wazir Dandan came in to him and said, "Be of goodcheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; in very sooth thybrother died not but because his hour was come, and there is noprofit in this mourning.  How well saith the poet,"Whatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass; * What is to     be without a failure shall become;Soon the becoming fortune shall be found to be, * And Folly's     brother[FN#453] shall abide forlorn and glum."Wherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thyheart to bear arms." He replied, "O Wazir, my heart is heavy forthe death of my father and my brother and for our absence fromhearth and home; and my mind is concerned for my subjects."Thereupon the Wazir and the bystanders wept; but they ceased notfrom pushing forward the siege of Constantinople for a length ofdays.  And they being thus, behold, news arrived from Baghdad, byone of the Emirs to the effect that the King's wife had beenblessed with a boy, and that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, hadnamed him Kanmakan.[FN#454] Moreover, that the boy bid fair to befamous, already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens; andthat she had commanded the Olema and the preachers to pray formother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise;furthermore that the twain were well, that the land had enjoyedabundant rains, and that his comrade the Fireman was establishedin all prosperity, with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him; butthat he was still ignorant of what had befallen him.  And sheended with the greeting of peace.  Then quoth Zau al- Makan tothe Wazir Dandan, "Now is my back strengthened for that I havebeen blest with a son whose name is Kanmakan."--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.          When it was the One Hundred and Sixth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theybrought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child,Zau al- Makan rejoiced with great joy and cried, "Now is my backstrengthened, for that I have been blessed with a son[FN#455]whose name is Kanmakan." And he spake to the Wazir Dandan,saying, "I am minded to leave this mourning and order perfectionsof the Koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on hisaccount." Quoth the Wazir, "Thy design is good." Thereupon hecaused tents to be pitched over his brother's tomb; so theyraised them and gathered together such of the men at arms ascould repeat the Koran; and some began reciting the Holy volume;whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of Allah, andthus they did till the morning.  Then Zau al-Makan went up to thegrave of his brother Sharrkan and poured forth copious tears, andimprovised these couplets,"They bore him bier'd, and all who followed wept * With Moses'     shrieks what day o'erhead shook Tor;[FN#456]Till reached the grave which Pate had made his home, * Dug in     men's souls who one sole God adore:Ne'er had I thought before to see my joy * Borne on the bier     which heads of bearers bore:Ah no!  nor ere they homed thee in the dust * That stars of     heaven earth ever covered o'er.Is the tomb dweller hostage of a stead, * Where light and     splendour o'er thy face shall pour?Praise to restore his life her word hath pledged: * Cribbed and     confined he shall dispread the more!"When Zau al-Makan had made an end of his versifying he wept andwept with him all the troops; then he came to the grave and threwhimself upon it wild with woe, and the Wazir repeated the wordsof the poet,"Pain leaving life that fleets thou hast th' eternal won; * Thou     didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath doneLeftest this worldly house without reproach or blame; * Ah, may     th' ex change secure thee every benison!Thou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence, * For us to     baffle shafts and whistling spears to shun.I see this world is only cheat and vanity, * Where man naught     else must seek but please the Truthful One:Th' Empyrean's Lord allow thee bower of heavenly bliss, * And wi'     thy faithful friends The Guide show goodly wone:I bid thee last good e'en with sigh of bitter grief, * Seeing the     West in woe for lack of Easting Sun."When the Wazir Dandan had finished his reciting, he wept withsore weeping and the tears rained from his eyes like cushionedpearls.  Then came forward one who had been of Sharrkan's booncompanions in his cups and he wept till ran in rills the drops,and he enumerated the dead man's generous qualities, reciting thefollowing pentastichs,"Where gone is Bounty since thy hand is turned to clay?  * And I     in misery lie since thou west ta'en away.See'st not, O litter guide[FN#457] (Heaven keep thee glad and     gay!), * How tears adorn my cheeks, these furrowed wrinkles     fray?        A sight to joy shine eyes and fill thee with        dismay.[FN#458]By Allah ne'er this heart within I spoke of thee; * Ah no!  nor     dared my sight to see thy brilliancy:Save that my tear drops sorest wound have garred me dree * Yea!     and if e'er on other rest these eyne of me,        May yearning draw their reins nor suffer sleep to see."And when the man stinted reciting, Zau al-Makan and the MinisterDandan wept and the whole army was moved to tears; after whichall retired to their tents, and the King turning to the Wazirtook counsel with him concerning the conduct of the campaign.  Onthis wise the two passed days and nights, while Zau al-Makan wasweighed down with grief and mourning till at last he said, "Ilong to hear stories and adventures of Kings and tales of loverfolk enslaved by love; haply Allah may make this to solace thatwhich is on my heart of heavy anxiety, and stint and stay myweeping and wailing." Quoth the Wazir, "If naught can dispel thytrouble but hearing curious tales of Kings and people long gonebefore and stories of folk enslaved by love of yore, and soforth, this thing were easy, for I had no other business, in thelifetime of thy father (who hath found mercy) than to relatestories and to repeat verses to him.  This very night I will tellthee a tale of a lover and his beloved, so shall thy breast bebroadened." When Zau al-Makan heard these words from theMinister, his heart was set upon that which had been promised tohim and he did nothing but watch for the coming of the night,that he might hear what the Wazir Dandan had to tell of the Kingsof yore and distracted lovers long gone before.  And hardly wouldhe believe that night had fallen ere he bade light the waxcandles and the lamps and bring all that was needful of meat anddrink and perfume gear, and what not; and when all was inpresence, he summoned the Wazir Dandan, and the Emirs Rustam andBahram and Tarkash and the Grand Chamberlain; then waited tillthe whole party was seated before him; whereupon he turned to theMinister and said, "Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hathlet down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tellus those tales which thou promisedst us." Replied the Wazir,"With joy and good will."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn ofday and ceased to say her permitted say.         When it was the One Hundred and Seventh Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when KingZau Al-Makan summoned the Wazir and the Chamberlain and Rustamand Bahram, he turned towards the Minister Dandan and said,"Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us itsveil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales whichthou promisedst us." Replied the Wazir, "With love and gladness! Know, O auspicious King, that there reached my ears a relation ofa lover and a loved one and of the discourse between them andwhat befel them of things rare and fair, a story such asrepelleth care from the heart and dispelleth sorrow like untothat of the patriarch Jacob[FN#459]; and it is as follows":Tale of Taj al-Muluk and the Princess Dunya(The Lover and the Loved).There stood in times long gone by behind the Mountains ofIspahan, a city highs the Green City, wherein dwelt a King namedSulayman Shah.  Now he was a man of liberality and beneficence,of justice and integrity, of generosity and sincerity, to whomtravellers repaired from every country, and his name was noisedabroad in all regions and cities and he reigned many a year inhigh worship and prosperity, save that he owned neither wives norchildren.  He had a Minister who rivalled him in goodness andgenerosity and it so happened that one day, he sent for him andwhen he came into the presence said to him, "O my Wazir, my heartis heavy and my patience is past and my force faileth me, forthat I have neither wife nor child.  This is not the way of Kingswho rule over all men, princes.  and paupers; for they rejoice inleaving behind them children and successors whereby are doubledtheir number and their strength.  Quoth the Prophet (whom Allahbless and keep!); 'Marry ye, increase ye, and multiply ye, that Imay boast me of your superiority over the nations on the Day ofResurrection.' So what is thy rede, O Wazir?  Advise me of whatcourse and contrivance be advisable!" When the Minister heardthese words, the tears sprang from his eyes in streams, and hereplied, "Far be it from me, O King of the Age, that I debate onthat which appertaineth to the Compassionate One!  Wilt thou haveme cast into the fire by the All powerful King's wrath and ire? Buy thee a concubine." Rejoined the King, "Know, O Wazir, thatwhen a sovereign buyeth a female slave, he knoweth neither herrank nor her lineage and thus he cannot tell if she be of simpleorigin that he may abstain from her, or of gentle strain that hemay be intimate in her companionship.  So, if he have commercewith her, haply she will conceive by him and her son be ahypocrite, a man of wrath and a shedder of blood.  Indeed thelike of such woman may be instanced by a salt and marshy soil,which if one till for ever it yieldeth only worthless growth andno endurance show eth; for it may be that her son will beobnoxious to his Lord's anger, doing not what He biddeth him orabstaining from what He for biddeth him.  Wherefore will I neverbecome the cause of this through the purchase of a concubine; andit is my desire that thou demand for me in marriage the daughterof some one of the Kings, whose lineage is known and whoseloveliness hath renown.  If thou can direct me to some maiden ofbirth and piety of the daughters of Moslem Sovranty, I will askher in marriage and wed her in presence of witnesses, so mayaccrue to me the favour of the Lord of all Creatures." Said theWazir, "O King, verily Allah hath fulfilled thy wish and hathbrought thee to thy desire;" presently adding, "Know, O King, ithath come to my knowledge that King Zahr Shah,[FN#460] Lord ofthe White Land, hath a daughter of surpassing loveliness whosecharms talk and tale fail to express: she hath not her equal inthis age, for she is perfect in proportion and symmetry, blackeyed as if Kohl dyed and long locked, wee of waist and heavy ofhip.  When she draweth nigh she seduceth and when she turneth herback[FN#461] she slayeth; she ravisheth heart and view and shelooketh even as saith of her the poet,'A thin waist maid who shames the willow wand; * Nor sun nor moon     can like her rising shine:'Tis as her honey dew of lips were blent * With wine, and pearls     of teeth were bathed in wine:Her form, like heavenly Houri's, graceful slim; * Fair face; and     ruin dealt by glancing eyne:How many a dead done man her eyes have slain * Upon her way of     love in ruin li'en:An live I she's my death!  I'll say no more * But dying without     her vain were life of mine.' "Now when the Wazir had made an end of describing that maiden, hesaid to Sulayman Shah, "It is my counsel, O King, that thoudespatch to her father an ambassador, sagacious, experienced andtrained in the ways of the world, who shall courteously demandher in marriage for thee of her sire; for in good sooth she hathnot her equal in the far parts of the world nor in the near.  Soshalt thou enjoy her lovely face in the way of grace, and theLord of Glory be content with thy case; for it is reported of theProphet (whom Allah bless and preserve!) that he said, 'There beno monkery in Al-Islam."' At this the King was transported toperfect joy; his breast was broadened and lightened; care andcark ceased from him and he turned to the Wazir and said, "Knowthou, O Minister, that none shall fare about this affair savethou, by reason of thy consummate intelligence and good breeding;wherefore hie thee home and do all thou hast to do and get theeready by the morrow and depart and demand me in marriage thismaiden, with whom thou hast occupied my heart and thought; andreturn not to me but with her." Replied the Wazir, "I hear and Iobey." Then he tried to his own house and bade make readypresents befitting Kings, of precious stones and things of priceand other matters light of load but weighty of worth, besidesRabite steeds and coats of mail, such as David made[FN#462] andchests of treasure for which speech hath no measure.  And theWazir loaded the whole on camels and mules, and set out attendedby an hundred slave girls with flags and banners flaunting overhis head.  The King charged him to return to him after a fewdays; and, when he was gone, Sulayman Shah lay on coals of fire,engrossed night and day with desire; while the envoy fared onwithout ceasing through gloom and light, spanning fertile fieldand desert site, till but a day's march remained between him andthe city whereto he was bound.  Here he sat him down on the banksof a river and, summoning one of his confidants, bade him wendhis way to King Zahr Shah and announce his approach withoutdelay.  Quoth the messenger, "I hear and I obey!" And he rode onin haste to that city and, as he was about to enter therein, itso chanced that the King, who was sitting in one of hispleasaunces before the city gate, espied him as he was passingthe doors, and knowing him for a stranger, bade bring him beforethe presence.  So the messenger coming forward informed him ofthe approach of the Wazir of the mighty King Sulayman Shah, Lordof the Green Land and of the Mountains of Ispahan: whereat KingZahr Shah rejoiced and welcomed him.  Then he carried him to hispalace and asked him, "Where leavedst thou the Wazir?"; and heanswered, "I left him in early day on the banks of such a riverand tomorrow he will reach thee, Allah continue his favours tothee and have mercy upon thy parents!" Thereupon King Zahr Shahcommanded one of his Wazirs to take the better part of hisGrandees and Chamberlains and Lieutenants and Lords of the land,and go out to meet the ambassador in honour of King SulaymanShah; for that his dominion extended over the country.  Such wasthe case with Zahr Shah; but as regards the Wazir he abode in hisstead till night was half spent[FN#463] and then set out for thecity; but when morning shone and the sun rose upon hill and down,of a sudden he saw King Zahr Shah's Wazir approaching him, withhis Chamberlains and high Lords and Chief Officers of thekingdom; and the two parties joined company at some parasangs'distance from the city.[FN#464]  Thereat the Wazir made sure ofthe success of his errand and saluted the escort, which ceasednot preceding him till they reached the King's palace and passedin before him through the gate to the seventh vestibule, a placewhere none might enter on horseback, for it was near to where theKing sat.  So the Minister alighted and fared on a foot till hecame to a lofty saloon, at whose upper end stood a marble couch,set with pearls and stones of price, and having for legs fourelephant's tusks.  Upon it was a coverlet of green satin purfledwith red gold, and above it hung a canopy adorned with pearls andgems, whereon sat King Zahr Shah, whilst his officers of statestood in attendance before him.  When the Wazir went in to him,he composed his mind and, unbinding his tongue, displayed theoratory of Wazirs and saluted the King in the language ofeloquence.--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased tosay her permitted say,         When it was the One Hundred and Eighth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theWazir of King Sulayman Shah entered the presence of King ZahrShah he composed his mind and, unbinding his tongue, displayedthe oratory of Wazirs and saluted the King in the language ofeloquence and improvised these couplets,"He cometh robed and bending gracefully: * O'er crop and cropper     dews of grace sheds he:He charms; nor characts, spells nor gramarye * May fend the     glances of those eyne from thee:Say to the blamer, "Blame me not, for I * From love of him will     never turn to flee":My heart hath played me false while true to him, * And Sleep, in     love with him, abhorreth me:O heart!  th'art not the sole who loveth him, * So bide with him     while I desertion dree:There's nought to joy mine ears with joyous sound * Save praise     of King Zahr Shah in jubilee:A King albeit thou leave thy life to win * One look, that look     were all sufficiency:And if a pious prayer thou breathe for him, * Shall join all     Faithfuls in such pious gree:Folk of his realm!  If any shirk his right * For other hoping,     gross Unfaith I see."When the Wazir had ended his poetry, King Zahr Shah bade him drawnear and honoured him with the highmost honours; then, seatinghim by his own side, smiled in his face and favoured him with agracious reply.  They ceased not on this wise till the time ofthe under meal when the attendants brought forward the tables offood in that saloon and all ate till they were sated; after whichthe tables were removed and those who were in the assemblywithdrew, leaving only the chief officers.  Now when the Ministersaw this, he rose to his feet and, after complimenting the King asecond time and kissing the ground before him, spake as follows,"O mighty King and dread Lord!  I have travelled hither and havevisited thee upon a matter which shall bring thee peace, profitand prosperity: and it is this, that I come as ambassador tothee, seeking in marriage thy daughter, the noble and illustriousmaid, from Sulayman Shah, a Prince famed for justice andintegrity, sincerity and generosity, Lord of the Green Land andof the Mountains of Ispahan, who sendeth thee of presents astore, and gifts of price galore, ardently desiring to become thyson in law.  But art thou inclined to him as he to thee?" He thenkept silence, awaiting a reply.  When King Zahr Shah heard thesewords, he sprang to his feet and kissed the ground respectfullybefore the Wazir, while the bystanders were confounded at hiscondescension to the ambassador and their minds were amazed. Then he praised Him who is the Lord of Honour and Glory andreplied (and he still standing), "O mighty Wazir and illustriousChief; hear thou what I say!  Of a truth we are to King SulaymanShah of the number of his subjects, and we shall be ennobled byhis alliance and we covet it ardently; for my daughter is ahandmaid of his handmaidens, and it is my dearest desire that hemay become my stay and my reliable support." Then he summoned theKazis and the witnesses, who should bear testimony that KingSulayman Shah had despatched his Wazir as proxy to conclude themarriage, and that King Zahr Shah joyfully acted and officiatedfor his daughter.  So the Kazis concluded the wedding contractand offered up prayers for the happiness and prosperity of thewedded feres; after which the Wazir arose and, fetching the giftsand rarities and precious things, laid them all before the King. Then Zahr Shah occupied himself anent the fitting out of hisdaughter and honourably entertained the Wazir and feasted hissubjects all, great and small; and for two months they held highfestival, omitting naught that could rejoice heart and eye.  Nowwhen all things needful for the bride were ready, the King causedthe tents to be carried out and they pitched the camp withinsight of the city, where they packed the bride's stuffs in chestsand get ready the Greek handmaids and Turkish slave girls, andprovided the Princess with great store of precious treasures andcostly jewels.  Then he had made for her a litter of red gold,inlaid with pearls and stones of price, and set apart two mulesto carry it; a litter which was like one of the chambers of apalace, and within which she seemed as she were of the loveliestHouris and it became as one of the pavilions of Paradise.  Andafter they had made bales of the treasures and monies, and hadloaded them upon the mules and camels, King Zahr Shah went forthwith her for a distance of three parasangs; after which he badefarewell to her and the Wazir and those with him, and returned tohis home in gladness and safety.  Thereupon the Wazir, faringwith the King's daughter, pushed on and ceased not his stagesover desert ways,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased saying her permitted say.          When it was the One Hundred and Ninth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazirfared on with the King's daughter and ceased not forcing hisstages over desert ways and hastened his best through nights anddays, till there remained between him and his city but threemarches.  Thereupon he sent forward to King Sulayman Shah one whoshould announce the coming of the bride.  The King rejoicedthereat and bestowed on the messenger a dress of honour; and badehis troops march forth in grand procession to meet the Princessand her company for due worship and honour, and don their richestapparel with banners flying over their heads.  And his orderswere obeyed.  He also commanded to cry throughout the city thatneither curtained damsel nor honoured lady nor time-rupturedcrone should fail to fare forth and meet the bride.  So they allwent out to greet her and the grandest of them vied in doing herservice and they agreed to bring her to the King's palace bynight.  More over, the chief officers decided to decorate theroad and to stand in espalier of double line, whilst the brideshould pass by preceded by her eunuchs and serving women and cladin the gear her father had given her.  So when she made herappearance, the troops surrounded her, these of the right wingand those of the left, and the litter ceased not advancing withher till she approached the palace; nor remained any but cameforth to gaze upon the Princess.  Drums were beaten and spearswere brandished and horns blared and flags fluttered and steedspranced for precedence and scents shed fragrance till theyreached the Palace gate and the pages entered with the litterthrough the Harim wicket.  The place shone with its splendoursand the walls glittered for the glamour of its gear.  Now whennight came, the eunuchs threw open the doors of the bridalchamber and stood surrounding the chief entrance whereupon thebride came forward and amid her damsels she was like the moonamong stars or an union shining on a string of lesser pearls, andshe passed into the bridal closet where they had set for her acouch of alabaster inlaid with unions and jewels.  As soon as shehad taken seat there, the King came in to her and Allah filledhis heart with her love so he abated her maidenhead and ceasedfrom him his trouble and disquiet.  He abode with her well nigh amonth but she had conceived by him the first night; and, when themonth was ended, he went forth and sat on his sofa of state, anddispensed justice to his subjects, till the months of herpregnancy were accomplished.  On the last day of the ninth month,towards day break, the Queen was seized with the pangs of labour;so she sat down on the stool of delivery and Allah made thetravail easy to her and she gave birth to a boy child, on whomappeared auspicious signs.  When the King heard of this, he joyedwith exceeding joy and rewarded the bearer of the good tidingswith much treasure; and of his gladness he went in to the childand kissed him between the eyes and wondered at his brilliantloveliness; for in him was approved the saying of the poet,"In the towering forts Allah throned him King, * A lion, a star     in the skies of reign:At his rising the spear and the throne rejoiced, * The gazelle,     the ostrich, The men of main:[FN#465]Mount him not on the paps, for right soon he'll show * That to     throne on the war steed's loins he's fain:And wean him from sucking of milk, for soon * A sweeter drink,     the foe's blood, he'll drain."Then the midwives took the newborn child and cut the navel cordand darkened his eyelids with Kohl powder[FN#466] and named himTaj al-Muluk Kharan.[FN#467]  He was suckled at the breast offond indulgence and was reared in the lap of happy fortune; andthus his days ceased not running and the years passing by till hereached the age of seven.  Thereupon Sulayman Shah summoned thedoctors and learned men and bade them teach his son writing andscience and belle-lettres.  This they continued to do for someyears, till he had learnt what was needful; and, when the Kingsaw that he was well grounded in whatso he desired, he took himout of the teachers' and professors' hands and engaged for him askilful master, who taught him cavalarice and knightly exercisestill the boy attained the age of fourteen; and when he faredabroad on any occasion, all who saw him were ravished by hisbeauty and made him the subject of verse; and even pious men wereseduced by his brilliant loveliness.--And Shahrazad perceived thedawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.          When it was the One Hundred and Tenth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, That when Tajal-Muluk Kharan, son of Sulayman Shah, became perfect in ridingcraft and excelled all those of his time, his excessive beauty,when he fared abroad on any occasion, caused all who saw him tobe ravished and to make him the subject of verse; and even piousmen were seduced by his brilliant loveliness.  Quoth the poet ofhim,"I clipt his form and wax'd drunk with his scent, * Fair branch     to whom Zephyr gave nutriment:Nor drunken as one who drinks wine, but drunk * With night     draught his lips of the honey dew lent:All beauty is shown in the all of him, * Hence all human hearts     he in hand hath hens:My mind, by Allah!  shall ne'er unmind * His love, while I wear     life's chains till spent:If I live, in his love I'll live; if I die * For pine and     longing, 'O blest!' I'll cryWhen he reached the eighteenth year of his age, tenderdown[FN#468] sprouted, on his side face fresh with youth, from amole upon one rosy cheek and a second beauty spot, like a grainof ambergris adorned the other; and he won the wits and eyes ofevery wight who looked on him, even as saith the poet,"He is Caliph of Beauty in Yusufs lieu, * And all lovers fear     when they sight his grace:Pause and gaze with me; on his cheek thou'lt sight * The     Caliphate's banner of sable hue."[FN#469]And as saith another,"Thy sight hath never seen a fairer sight, * Of all things men     can in the world espy,Than yon brown mole, that studs his bonny cheek * Of rosy red     beneath that jet black eye."And as saith another,"I marvel seeing yon mole that serves his cheeks' bright flame *     Yet burneth not in fire albeit Infidel[FN#470]I wonder eke to see that apostolic glance, * Miracle working,     though it work by magic spell:How fresh and bright the down that decks his cheek, and yet *     Bursten gall bladders feed which e'en as waters well."And as saith another,"I marvel hearing people questioning of * The Fount of Life and     in what land 'tis found:I see it sprung from lips of dainty fawn, * Sweet rosy mouth with     green mustachio down'd:And wondrous wonder 'tis when Moses viewed * That Fount, he     rested not from weary round."[FN#471]Now having developed such beauty, when he came to man's estatehis loveliness increased, and it won for him many comrades andintimates; while every one who drew near to him wished that Tajal-Muluk Kharan might become Sultan after his father's death, andthat he himself might be one of his Emirs.  Then took hepassionately to chasing and hunting which he would hardly leavefor a single hour.  His father, King Sulayman Shah, would haveforbidden him the pursuit fearing for him the perils of the wasteand the wild beasts; but he paid no heed to his warning voice. And it so chanced that once upon a time he said to his attendants"Take ye ten days food and forage;" and, when they obeyed hisbidding, he set out with his suite for sport and disport.  Theyrode on into the desert and ceased not riding four days, tillthey came to a place where the ground was green, and they saw init wild beasts grazing and trees with ripe fruit growing andsprings flowing.  Quoth Taj al-Muluk to his followers, "Set upthe nets here and peg them in a wide ring and let our trystingplace be at the mouth of the fence, in such a spot." So theyobeyed his words and staked out a wide circle with toils; andthere gathered together a mighty matter of all kinds of wildbeasts and gazelles, which cried out for fear of the men andthrew themselves for fright in the face of the horses.  Then theyloosed on to them the hounds and lynxes[FN#472] andhawks;[FN#473] and they shot the quarry down with shafts whichpierced their vitals; and, by the time they came to the furtherend of the net ring, they had taken a great number of the wildbeasts, and the rest fled.  Then Taj al-Muluk dismounted by thewater side and bade the game be brought before himself, anddivided it, after he had set apart the best of the beasts for hisfather, King Sulayman Shah, and despatched the game to him; andsome he distributed among the officers of his court.  He passedthe night in that place, and when morning dawned there came up acaravan of merchants conveying negro slaves and white servants,and halted by the water and the green ground.  When Taj al-Muluksaw them, he said to one of his companions, "Bring me news ofyonder men and question them why they have halted in thisplace."[FN#474]  So the messenger went up to them and addressedthem, "Tell me who ye be, and answer me an answer without delay."Replied they, "We are merchants and have halted to rest, for thatthe next station is distant and we abide here because we haveconfidence in King Sulayman Shah and his son, Taj al-Muluk, andwe know that all who alight in his dominions are in peace andsafety; more over we have with us precious stuffs which we havebrought for the Prince." So the messenger returned and told thesenews to the King's son who, hearing the state of the case andwhat the merchants had replied, said, "If they have brought stuffon my account I will not enter the city nor depart hence till Isee it shown to me." Then he mounted horse and rode to thecaravan and his Mamelukes followed him till he reached it. Thereupon the merchants rose to receive him and invoked on himDivine aid and favour with continuance of glory and virtues;after which they pitched him a pavilion of red satin, embroideredwith pearls and jewels, wherein they spread him a kingly divanupon a silken carpet worked at the upper end with emeralds set ingold.  There Taj al-Muluk seated himself whilst his whiteservants stood in attendance upon him, and sent to bid themerchants bring out all that they had with them.  Accordingly,they produced their merchandise, and displayed the whole and heviewed it and took of it what liked him, paying them the price. Then he looked about him at the caravan, and remounted and wasabout to ride onwards, when his glance fell on a handsome youthin fair attire, and a comely and shapely make, with flower whitebrow and moon like face, save that his beauty was wasted and thatyellow hues had overspread his cheeks by reason of parting fromthose he loved;--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased to say her permitted say.        When it was the One Hundred and Eleventh Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Taj Al-Muluk, when he looked about him at the caravan, saw a handsomeyouth in neat attire and of shapely make, with flower likeforehead and moon like face, save that his beauty was wasted andyellow hues had overspread his cheeks by reason of parting fromthose he loved; and great was his groaning and moaning, and thetears streamed from his eyelids as he repeated these couplets,"Longsome is Absence; Care and Fear are sore, * And ceaseless     tears, O friend, mine eyes outpour:Yea, I farewelled my heart on parting day * And heartless,     hopeless, now I bide forlore:Pause, O my friend, with me farewelling one * Whose words my cure     can work, my health restore!"Now when the youth ended his poetry he wept awhile and fell downin a fainting fit, whilst Taj al-Muluk looked at him and wonderedat his case.  Then, coming to himself, he stared with distractedair, and versified in these couplets,"Beware her glance I rede thee, 'tis like wizard wight, * None     can escape unscathed those eye shafts' glancing flight:In very sooth black eyes, with languorous sleepy look, * Pierce     deeper than white swords however these may bite.Be not thy senses by her sweets of speech beguiled, * Whose     brooding fever shall ferment in thought and sprite:Soft sided Fair[FN#475] did silk but press upon her skin, *     'Twould draw red blood from it, as thou thyself canst sight.Chary is she of charms twixt neck and anklets dwell, * And ah!     what other scent shall cause me such delight?[FN#476]"Then he sobbed a loud sob and swooned away.  But when Taj al-Muluk saw him in this case, he was perplexed about his state andwent up to him; and, as the youth came to his senses and saw theKing's son standing at his head, he sprang to his feet and kissedthe ground between his hands.  Taj al-Muluk asked him, 'Why didstthou not show us thy merchandise?" end he answered, O my lord,there is naught among my stock worthy of thine august highness."Quoth the Prince, "Needs must thou show me what thou hast andacquaint me with thy circumstance; for I see thee weeping eyedand heavyhearted.  If thou have been oppressed, we will end thineoppression, and if thou be in debt, we will pay thy debt; for ofa truth my heart burneth to see thee, since I first set eyes onthee."[FN#477]  Then Taj al-Muluk bade the seats be set, and theybrought him a chair of ivory and ebony with a net work of goldand silk, and spread him a silken rug for his feet.  So he satdown on the chair and bidding the youth seat himself on the rugsaid to him, "Show me thy stock in trade!" The young merchantreplied, "O my Lord, do not name this to me, for my goods beunworthy of thee." Rejoined Taj al-Muluk "It needs must bethus!"; and bade some of the pages fetch the goods.  So theybrought them in despite of him; and, when he saw them, the tearsstreamed from his eyes and he wept and sighed and lamented: sobsrose in his throat and he repeated these couplets,"By what thine eyelids show of Kohl and coquetry!  * By what thy     shape displays of lissome symmetry!By what thy liplets store of honey dew and wine!  * By what thy     mind adorns of gracious kindly gree!To me thy sight dream-visioned, O my hope!  exceeds * The     happiest escape from horriblest injury."Then the youth opened his bales and displayed his merchandise toTaj Al-Muluk in detail, piece by piece, and amongst them hebrought out a gown of satin brocaded with gold, worth twothousand dinars.  When he opened the gown there fell a piece oflinen from its folds.  As soon as the young merchant saw this hecaught up the piece of linen in haste and hid it under his thigh;and his reason wandered, and he began versifying,"When shall be healed of thee this heart that ever bides in woe?      * Than thee the Pleiad-stars more chance of happy meeting     showParting and banishment and longing pain and lowe of love, *     Procrastinating[FN#478] and delay these ills my life lay     low:Nor union bids me live in joy, nor parting kills by grief, * Nor     travel draws me nearer thee nor nearer comest thou:Of thee no justice may be had, in thee dwells naught of rush, *     Nor gain of grace by side of thee, nor flight from thee I     know:For love of thee all goings forth and comings back are strait *     On me, and I am puzzled sore to know where I shall go."Taj al-Muluk wondered with great wonder at his verse, and couldnot comprehend the cause.  But when the youth snatched up the bitof linen and placed it under thigh, he asked him, "What is thatpiece of linen?" "O my Lord," answered the merchant, "thou hastno concern with this piece." Quoth the King's son, "Show it me;"and quoth the merchant, "O my lord, I refused to show thee mygoods on account of this piece of linen; for I cannot let theelook upon it."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased saying her permitted say,         When it was the One Hundred and Twelfth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youngmerchant said to Taj al-Muluk, "I did not refuse to show thee mygoods save on this account, for I cannot let thee look upon it."Whereupon Taj al Muluk retorted, "Perforce I must and will seeit;" and insisted and became angry.  So the youth drew it outfrom under his thigh, and wept and moaned and redoubled his sighsand groans, and repeated these verses,"Now blame him not; for blame brings only irk and pain! * Indeed,     I spake him sooth but ne'er his ear could gain:May Allah guard my moon which riseth in the vale * Beside our     camp, from loosed robe like skyey plain:[FN#479]I left him but had Love vouchsafed to leave for me * Some peace     in life such leave of him I ne'er had ta'en:How long he pleaded for my sake on parting morn, * While down his     cheeks and mine tears ran in railing rain:Allah belie me not: the garb of mine excuse * This parting rent,     but I will Mend that garb again!No couch is easy to my side, nor on such wise * Aught easeth him,     when all alone without me lain:Time with ill omened hand hath wrought between us two, * And made     my waxing joys to wane and his to wane,And poured mere grief and woe, what time Time fain had crowned *     The bowl he made me drink and gave for him to drain."When he ended his recitation, quoth Taj al-Muluk, "I see thyconduct without consequence; tell me then why weepest thou at thesight of this rag!" When the young merchant heard speak of thepiece of linen, he sighed and answered, "O my lord, my story is astrange and my case out of range, with regard to this piece oflinen and to her from whom I brought it and to her who wrought onit these figures and emblems." Hereupon, he spread out the pieceof linen, and behold, thereon was the figure of a gazelle wroughtin silk and worked with red gold, and facing it was anothergazelle traced in silver with a neck ring of red gold and threebugles[FN#480] of chrysolite upon the ring.  When Taj al-Muluksaw the beauty of these figures, he exclaimed, "Glory be to Allahwho teacheth man that which he knoweth not!"[FN#481]  And hisheart yearned to hear the youth's story; so he said to him, "Tellme thy story with her who owned these gazelles." Replied theyoung man: "Hear, O my Lord, the Tale of Aziz and Azizah.[FN#482]My father was a wealthy merchant and Allah had vouchsafed him noother child than myself; but I had a cousin, Azizah highs,daughter of my paternal uncle and we twain were brought up in onehouse; for her father was dead and before his death, he hadagreed with my father that I should marry her.  So when I reachedman's estate and she reached womanhood, they did not separate herfrom me or me from her, till at last my father spoke to my motherand said, "This very year we will draw up the contract ofmarriage between Aziz and Azizah." So having agreed upon this hebetook himself to preparing provision for the wedding feast. Still we ceased not to sleep on the same carpet knowing naught ofthe case, albeit she was more thoughtful, more intelligent andquicker witted than I.  Now when my father had made an end of hispreparations, and naught remained for him but to write out thecontract and for me but to consummate the marriage with mycousin, he appointed the wedding for a certain Friday, afterpublic prayers; and, going round to his intimates among the merchants and others, he acquainted them with that, whilst my motherwent forth and invited her women friends and summoned her kithand kin.  When the Friday came, they cleaned the saloon andprepared for the guests and washed the marble floor; then theyspread tapestry about our house and set out thereon what wasneedful, after they had hung its walls with cloth of gold.  Nowthe folk had agreed to come to us after the Friday prayers; so myfather went out and bade them make sweetmeats and sugared dishes,and there remained nothing to do but to draw up the contract. Then my mother sent me to the bath and sent after me a suit ofnew clothes of the richest; and, when I came out of the Hammam, Idonned those habits which were so perfumed that as I went along,there exhaled from them a delicious fragrance scenting thewayside.  I had designed to repair to the Cathedral mosque when Ibethought me of one of my friends and returned in quest of himthat he might be present at the writing of the contract; andquoth I to myself, "This matter will occupy me till near the timeof congregational prayer." So I went on and entered a by streetwhich I had never before entered, perspiring profusely from theeffects of the bath and the new clothes on my body; and the sweatstreamed down whilst the scents of my dress were wafted abroad: Itherefore sat me at the upper end of the street resting on astone bench, after spreading under me an embroidered kerchief Ihad with me.  The heat oppressed me more and more, making myforehead perspire and the drops trickled along my cheeks; but Icould not wipe my face with my kerchief because it was dispreadunder me.  I was about to take the skirt of my robe and wipe mycheeks with it, when unexpectedly there fell on me from above awhite kerchief, softer to the touch than the morning breeze andpleasanter to the sight than healing to the diseased.  I hent itin hand and raised my head to see whence it had fallen, when myeyes met the eyes of the lady who owned these gazelles.--AndShahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying herpermitted say       When it was the One Hundred and Thirteenth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youthcontinued to Taj al-Muluk: "So I raised my head to see whencethis kerchief had fallen, when my eyes met those of the lady whoowned these gazelles.  And lo! she was looking out of a wicket ina lattice of brass and never saw my eyes a fairer than she, andin fine my tongue faileth to describe her beauty.  When shecaught sight of me looking at her, she put her forefinger intoher mouth, then joined her middle finger and her witnessfinger[FN#483] and laid them on her bosom, between her breasts;after which she drew in her head and closed the wicket shutterand went her ways.  There upon fire broke out in and was heapedupon my heart, and greater grew my smart; the one sight cost me athousand sighs and I abode perplexed, for that I heard no word byher spoken, nor understood the meaning of her token.  I looked atthe window a second time, but found it shut and waited patientlytill sundown, but sensed no sound and saw no one in view.  Sowhen I despaired of seeing her again, I rose from my place andtaking up the handkerchief, opened it, when there breathed fromit a scent of musk which caused me so great delight I became asone in Paradise.[FN#484] Then I spread it before me and outdropped from it a delicate little scroll; whereupon I opened thepaper which was perfumed with a delicious perfume, and thereinwere writ these couplets,"I sent to him a scroll that bore my plaint of love, * Writ in     fine delicate hand; for writing proves man's skill:Then quoth to me my friend, 'Why is thy writing thus; * So fine,     so thin drawn 'tis to read unsuitable?'Quoth I, 'for that I'm fine-drawn wasted, waxed thin, * Thus     lovers' writ Should be, for so Love wills his will.And after casting my eyes on the beauty of the kerchief,[FN#485]I saw upon one of its two borders the following couplets workedin with the needle,"His cheek down writeth (O fair fall the goodly scribe!) * Two     lines on table of his face in Rayhan-hand:[FN#486]O the wild marvel of the Moon when comes he forth!  * And when he     bends, O shame to every Willow wand!"And on the opposite border these two couplets were traced,"His cheek down writeth on his cheek with ambergris on pearl *     Two lines, like jet on apple li'en, the goodliest design:Slaughter is in those languid eyne whene'er a glance they deal, *     And drunkenness in either cheek and not in any wine."When I read the poetry on the handkerchief the flames of lovedarted into my heart, and yearning and pining redoubled theirsmart.  So I took the kerchief and the scroll and went home,knowing no means to win my wish, for that I was incapable ofconducting love affairs and inexperienced in interpreting hintsand tokens.  Nor did I reach my home ere the night was far spentand I found the daughter of my uncle sitting in tears.  But assoon as she saw me she wiped away the drops and came up to me,and took off my walking dress and asked me the reason of myabsence, saying, "All the folk, Emirs and notables and merchantsand others, assembled in our house; and the Kazi and thewitnesses were also present at the appointed time.  They ate andtarried awhile sitting to await thine appearance for the writingof the contract; and, when they despaired of thy presence, theydispersed and went their ways.  And indeed," she added, "thyfather raged with exceeding wrath by reason of this, and sworethat he would not celebrate our marriage save during the comingyear, for that he hath spent on these festivities great store ofmoney." And she ended by asking, "What hath befallen thee thisday to make thee delay till now?; and why hast thou allowed thatto happen which happened because of thine absence?" Answered I,"O daughter of mine uncle, question me not concerning what hathbefallen me."[FN#487] Then I told her all that had passed frombeginning to end, and showed her the handkerchief.  She took thescroll and read what was written therein; and tears ran down hercheeks and she repeated these cinquains,"Who saith that Love at first of free will came, * Say him: Thou     liest!  Love be grief and grame:Yet shall such grame and grief entail no shame; * All annals     teach us one thing and the same        Good current coin clips coin we may not crepe!An please thou, say there's pleasure in thy pain, * Find     Fortune's playful gambols glad and fain:Or happy blessings in th' unhappy's bane, * That joy or grieve,     with equal might and main:        Twixt phrase and antiphrase I'm all a heap!But he, withal, whose days are summer bright, * Whom maids e'er     greet with smiling lips' delight;Whom spicey breezes fan in every site * And wins whate'er he     wills, that happy wight        White blooded coward heart should never keep!"Then she asked me, "What said she, and what signs made she tothee?" I answered, "She uttered not a word, but put her forefinger in her mouth, then joining it to her middle finger, laidboth fingers on her bosom and pointed to the ground.  Thereuponshe withdrew her head and shut the wicket; and after that I sawher no more.  However, she took my heart with her, so I sat tillsun down, expecting her again to look out of the window; but shedid it not; and, when I despaired of her, I rose from my seat andcame home.  This is my history and I beg thee to help me in thismy sore calamity." Upon this she raised her face to me and said,"O son of mine uncle, if thou soughtest my eye, I would tear itfor thee from its eyelids, and perforce I cannot but aid thee tothy desire and aid her also to her desire; for she is whelmed inpassion for thee even as thou for her." Asked I, "And what is theinterpretation of her signs?"; and Azizah answered, "As for theputting her finger in her mouth,[FN#488] it showed that thou artto her as her soul to her body and that she would bite into unionwith thee with her wisdom teeth.  As for the kerchief, itbetokeneth that her breath of life is bound up in thee.  As forthe placing her two fingers on her bosom between her breasts, itsexplanation is that she saith; 'The sight of thee may dispel mygrief.' For know, O my cousin, that she loveth thee and shetrusteth in thee.  This is my interpretation of her signs and,could I come and go at Will, I would bring thee and her togetherin shortest time, and curtain you both with my skirt." Hearingthese words I thanked her (continued the young merchant) forspeaking thus, and said to myself, "I will wait two days." So Iabode two days in the house, neither going out nor coming in;neither eating nor drinking but I laid my head on my cousin'slap, whilst she comforted me and said to me, "Be resolute and ofgood heart and hope for the best!"--And Shahrazad perceived thedawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,       When it was the One Hundred and Fourteenth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youthpursued to Taj al-Muluk:--"And when the two days were past shesaid to me, "Be of good cheer and clear thine eyes of tears andtake courage to dress thyself and go to her, according to thytryst." Then she rose and changed my clothes and perfumed me withincense smoke.  So I braced myself up and heartened my heart andwent out and walked on till I came to the by-street, where I satdown on the bench awhile.  And behold, the wicket suddenly openedand I looked up and seeing her, fell down in a swoon.  When Irevived, I called up resolution and took courage and gazed againat her and again became insensible to the world around me.  ThenI came to myself and looking at her, saw that she held in hand amirror and a red kerchief.  Now when she caught my glance, shebared her forearms and opened her five fingers and smote herbreast with palm and digits; and after this she raised her handsand, holding the mirror outside the wicket, she took the redkerchief and retired into the room with it, but presentlyreturned and putting out her hand with the kerchief, let it downtowards the lane three several times, dipping it and raising itas often.  Then she wrung it out and folded it in her hands,bending down her head the while; after which she drew it in fromthe lattice and, shutting the wicket shutter, went away without asingle word; nay, she left me confounded and knowing not whatsignified her signs.[FN#489].  I tarried sitting there tillsupper time and did not return home till near midnight; and thereI found the daughter of my uncle with her cheek props in her handand her eyelids pouring forth tears; and she was repeating thesecouplets,"Woe's me! why should the blamer gar thee blaming bow?  * How be     consoled for thee that art so tender bough?Bright being! on my vitals cost thou prey, and drive * My heart     before platonic passion's[FN#490] force to bow.Thy Turk like[FN#491] glances havoc deal in core of me, * As     furbished sword thin ground at curve could never show:Thou weigh's" me down with weight of care, while I have not *     Strength e'en to bear my shift, so weakness lays me low:Indeed I weep blood tears to hear the blamer say; * 'The lashes     of thy lover's eyne shall pierce thee through!'Thou hast, my prince of loveliness! an Overseer,[FN#492] * Who     wrongs me, and a Groom[FN#493] who beats me down with brow.He foully lies who says all loveliness belonged * To Joseph, in     thy loveliness is many a Joe:I force myself to turn from thee, in deadly fright * Of spies;     and what the force that turns away my sight!"When I heard her verse, cark increased and care redoubled on meand I fell down in a corner of our house; whereupon she arose inhaste and, coming to me lifted me up and took off my outerclothes and wiped my face with her sleeve.  Then she asked mewhat had befallen me, and I described all that had happened fromher.  Quoth she, "O my cousin, as for her sign to thee with herpalm and five fingers its interpretation is, Return after fivedays; and the putting forth of her head out of the window, andher gestures with the mirror and the letting down and raising upand wringing out of the red kerchief,[FN#494] signify, Sit in thedyer's shop till my messenger come to thee." When I heard herwords fire flamed up in my heart and I exclaimed, "O daughter ofmy uncle, thou sayest sooth in this thine interpretation; for Isaw in the street the shop of a Jew dyer." Then I wept, and shesaid, "Be of good cheer and strong heart: of a truth others areoccupied with love for years and endure with constancy the ardourof passion, whilst thou hast but a week to wait; why then thisimpatience?" Thereupon she went on cheering me with comfortabletalk and brought me food: so I took a mouthful and tried to eatbut could not; and I abstained from meat and drink and estrangedmyself from the solace of sleep, till my colour waxed yellow andI lost my good looks; for I had never been in love before nor hadI ever savoured the ardour of passion save this time.  So I fellsick and my cousin also sickened on my account; but she wouldrelate to me, by way of consolation, stories of love and loversevery night till I fell asleep; and when ever I awoke, I foundher wakeful for my sake with tears running down her cheeks.  Thisceased not till the five days were past, when my cousin rose andwarmed some water and bathed me with it.  Then she dressed me inmy best and said to me, "Repair to her and Allah fulfil thy wishand bring thee to thy desire of thy beloved!" So I went out andceased not walking on till I came to the upper end of the bystreet.  As it was the Sabbath[FN#495] I found the dyer's shoplocked and sat before it, till I heard the call to mid afternoonprayer.  Then the sun yellowed and the Mu'ezzins[FN#496] chantedthe call to sundown prayer and the night came; but I saw no signnor heard one word, nor knew any news of her.  So I feared for mylife sitting there alone; and at last I arose and walked homereeling like a drunken man.  When I reached the house, I found mycousin Azizah standing, with one hand grasping a peg driven intothe wall and the other on her breast; and she was sighing andgroaning and repeating these couplets,"The longing of an Arab lass forlorn of kith and kin * (Who to     Hijazian willow wand and myrtle[FN#497] cloth incline,And who, when meeting caravan, shall with love-lowe set light *     To bivouac fire, and bang for conk her tears of pain and     pine)Exceeds not mine for him nor more devotion shows, but he * Seeing     my heart is wholly his spurns love as sin indign."Now when she had finished her verse she turned to me and, seeingme, wiped away her tears and my tears with her sleeve.  Then shesmiled in my face and said, "O my cousin, Allah grant theeenjoyment of that which He hath given thee!  Why didst thou notpass the night by the side of thy beloved and why hast thou notfulfilled thy desire of her?" When I heard her words, I gave hera kick in the breast and she fell down in the saloon and her browstruck upon the edge of the raised pavement and hit against awooden peg therein.  I looked at her and saw that her foreheadwas cut open and the blood running,--And Shahrazad perceived thedawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.        When it was the One Hundred and Fifteenth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youngmerchant continued to Taj al-Muluk: "Now when I kicked thedaughter of my uncle in the breast she fell on the edge of theraised pavement in the saloon and her brow struck upon a woodenpeg.  Thereby her forehead was cut open and the blood ran down,but she was silent and did not utter a single sound.[FN#498] Presently she rose up, and made some tinder of rags, thenstaunching with it the bleeding wound, bound her forehead with abandage; after which she wiped up the blood that had fallen onthe carpet, and it was as if nothing had been.  Presently shecame up to me and smiling in my face, said with gentle voice, "ByAllah, O son of my uncle, I spake not these words to mock at theeor at her!  But I was troubled with an ache in my head and wasminded to be blooded, but now thou hast eased my head andlightened my brow; so tell me what hath befallen thee to day."Thereupon I told her all that had passed between me and her thatday; and she wept as she heard my words and said, "O son of myuncle, rejoice at the good tidings of thy desire being fulfilledand thine aim being attained.  Of a truth this is a sign ofacceptance; for that she stayed away only because she wisheth totry thee and know if thou be patient or not, and sincere in thylove for her or otherwise.  Tomorrow, repair to her at the oldplace and see what sign she maketh to thee; for indeed thygladness is near and the end of thy sadness is at hand." And shewent on to comfort me; but my cark and care ceased not toincrease on me.  Presently she brought me food which I kickedaway with my foot so that the contents of every saucer werescattered in all directions, and I said, "Every lover is amadman; he inclineth not to food neither enjoyeth he sleep." Andmy cousin Azizah rejoined, "By Allah, O son of my uncle, these bein very deed the signs of love!" And the tears streamed down hercheeks whenas she gathered the fragments of the saucers and wipedup the food; then she took seat and talked to me, whilst I prayedAllah to hasten the dawn.  At last, when morning arose with itssheen and shine, I went out to seek her and hastening to her bystreet sat down on that bench, when lo!  the wicket opened andshe put out her head laughing.  Then she disappeared within andreturned with a mirror, a bag; and a pot full of green plants andshe held in hand a lamp.  The first thing she did was to take themirror and, putting it into the bag, tie it up and throw it backinto the room; then she let down her hair over her face and setthe lamp on the pot of flowers during the twinkling of an eye;then she took up all the things and went away shutting the windowwithout saying a word.  My heart was riven by this state of thecase, and by her secret signals, her mysterious secrets and herutter silence; and thereby my longing waxed more violent and mypassion and distraction redoubled on me.  So I retraced my steps,tearful-eyed and heavy hearted, and returned home, where I foundthe daughter of my uncle sitting with her face to the wall; forher heart was burning with grief and galling jealousy; albeit heraffection forbade her to acquaint me with what she suffered ofpassion and pining when she saw the excess of my longing anddistraction.  Then I looked at her and saw on her head twobandages, one on account of the accident to her forehead and theother over her eye in consequence of the pain she endured forstress of weeping; and she was in miserable plight shedding tearsand repeating these couplets,"I number nights; indeed I count night after night; * Yet lived I     long ere learnt so sore accompt to see, ah!Dear friend, I compass not what Allah pleased to doom * For     Layla, nor what Allah destined for me, ah!To other giving her and unto me her love, * What loss but Layla's     loss would He I ever dree, ah!"And when she had finished her reciting, she looked towards me andseeing me through her tears, wiped them away and came up to mehastily, but could not speak for excess of love.  So she remainedsilent for some while and then said, "O my cousin, tell me whatbefel thee with her this time." I told her all that had passedand she said, "Be patient, for the time of thy union is come andthou hast attained the object of thy hopes.  As for her signal tothee with the mirror which she put in the bag, it said to thee,When the sun is set; and the letting down of her hair over herface signified, When night is near and letteth fall the blacknessof the dark and hath starkened the daylight, come hither.  As forher gesture with the pot of green plants it meant, When thoucomest, enter the flower garden which is behind the street; andas for her sign with the lamp it denoted, When thou enterest theflower garden walk down it and make for the place where thouseest the lamp shining; and seat thyself beneath it and await me;for the love of thee is killing me." When I heard these wordsfrom my cousin, I cried out from excess of passion and said, "Howlong wilt thou promise me and I go to her, but get not my willnor find any true sense in thine interpreting." Upon this shelaughed and replied, "It remaineth for thee but to have patienceduring the rest of this day till the light darken and the nightstarker and thou shalt enjoy union and accomplish thy hopes; andindeed all my words be without leasing." Then she repeated thesetwo couplets,"Let days their folds and plies deploy, * And shun the house that     deals annoy!Full oft when joy seems farthest far * Thou nighmost art to hour     of joy."'Then she drew near to me and began to comfort me with soothingspeech, but dared not bring me aught of food, fearing lest I beangry with her and hoping I might incline to her; so when comingto me she only took off my upper garment and said to me, "Sit Omy cousin, that I may divert thee with talk till the end of theday and, Almighty Allah willing, as soon as it is night thoushalt be with thy beloved." But I paid no heed to her and ceasednot looking for the approach of darkness, saying, "O Lord, hastenthe coming of the night!" And when night set in, the daughter ofmy uncle wept with sore weeping and gave me a crumb of pure musk,and said to me, "O my cousin, put this crumb in thy mouth, andwhen thou hast won union with thy beloved and hast taken thy willof her and she hath granted thee thy desire, repeat to her thiscouplet,'Ho, lovers all!  by Allah say me sooth * What shall he do when     love sore vexeth youth?'"[FN#499]And she kissed me and swore me not to repeat this couplet till Ishould be about to leave my lover and I said, "Hearing isobeying!" And when it was supper-tide I went out and ceased notwalking on till I came to the flower garden whose door I foundopen.  So I entered and, seeing a light in the distance, madetowards it and reaching it, came to a great pavilion vaulted overwith a dome of ivory and ebony, and the lamp hung from the midstof the dome.  The floor was spread with silken carpetsembroidered in gold and silver, and under the lamp stood a greatcandle, burning in a candelabrum of gold.  In mid pavilion was afountain adorned with all manner of figures;[FN#500] and by itsside stood a table covered with a silken napkin, and on its edgea great porcelain bottle full of wine, with a cup of crystalinlaid with gold.  Near all these was a large tray of silvercovered over, and when I uncovered it I found therein fruits ofevery kind, figs and pomegranates, grapes and oranges, citronsand shaddocks[FN#501] disposed amongst an infinite variety ofsweet scented flowers, such as rose, jasmine, myrtle, eglantine,narcissus and all sorts of sweet smelling herbs.  I was charmedwith the place and I joyed with exceeding joy, albeit I found notthere a living soul and my grief and anxiety ceased from me.--AndShahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased to say herpermitted say.        When it was the One Hundred and Sixteenth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youngmerchant continued to Taj al-Muluk: "I was charmed with the placeand joyed with great joy albeit there I found not a living soulof Almighty Allah's creatures, and saw nor slave nor hand maid tooversee these things or to watch and ward these properties.  So Isat down in the pavilion to await the coming of the beloved of myheart; but the first hour of the night passed by, and the secondhour, and the third hour, and still she came not.  Then hungergrew sore upon me, for that it was long since I had tasted foodby reason of the violence of my love: but when I found the placeeven as my cousin had told me, and saw the truth of her interpretation of my beloved's signs, my mind was set at rest and Ifelt the pangs of hunger; moreover, the odour of the viands onthe table excited me to eat.  So making sure of attaining mydesire, and being famished for food I went up to the table andraised the cover and found in the middle a china dish containingfour chickens reddened with roasting and seasoned with spices,round the which were four saucers, one containing sweetmeats,another conserve of pomegranate seeds, a third almondpastry[FN#502] and a fourth honey fritters; and the contents ofthese saucers were part sweet and part sour.  So I ate of thefritters and a piece of meat, then went on to the almond cakesand ate what I could; after which I fell upon the sweetmeats,whereof I swallowed a spoonful or two or three or four, endingwith part of a chicken and a mouthful of something beside.  Uponthis my stomach became full and my joints loose and I waxed toodrowsy to keep awake; so I laid my head on a cushion, afterhaving washed my hands, and sleep over came me; I knew not whathappened to me after this, and I awoke not till the sun's heatscorched me, for that I had never once tasted sleep for dayspast.  When I awoke I found on my stomach a piece of salt and abit of charcoal; so I stood up and shook my clothes and turned tolook right and left, but could see no one; and discovered that Ihad been sleeping on the marble pavement without bedding beneathme.  I was perplexed thereat and afflicted with great affliction;the tears ran down my cheeks and I mourned for myself.  Then Ireturned home, and when I entered, I found my cousin beating herhand on her bosom and weeping tears like rain shedding clouds;and she versified with these couplets,"Blows from my lover's land a Zephyr cooly sweet, * And with its     every breath makes olden love new glow:O Zephyr of the morning hour, come show to us * Each lover hath     his lot, his share of joy and woe:Could I but win one dearest wish, we had embraced * With what     embrace and clip of breast fond lovers know.Allah forbids, while bides unseen my cousin's face, * All joys     the World can give or hand of Time bestow.Would Heaven I knew his heart were like this heart of me, *     Melted by passion-flame and charged with longing owe."When she saw me, she rose in haste and wiped away her tears andaddressed me with her soft speech, saying, "O son of my uncle,verily Allah hath been gracious to thee in thy love, for that shewhom thou lovest loveth thee, whilst I pass my time in weepingand bewailing my severance from thee who blamest me and chidestme; but may Allah not punish thee for my sake!" Thereupon shesmiled in my face a smile of reproach and caressed me; thentaking off my walking clothes, she spread them out and said, "ByAllah, this is not the scent of one who hath enjoyed his lover! So tell me what hath befallen thee, O my cousin." I told her allthat had passed, and she smiled again a smile of reproach andsaid, "Verily, my heart is full of pain; but may he not live whowould hurt thy heart!  Indeed, this woman maketh herselfinordinately dear and difficult to thee, and by Allah, O son ofmy uncle, I fear for thee from her.[FN#503]  Know, O my cousin,that the meaning of the salt is thou west drowned in sleep likeinsipid food, disgustful to the taste; and it is as though shesaid to thee; 'It behoveth thou be salted lest the stomach ejectthee; for thou professes to be of the lovers noble and true; butsleep is unlawful and to a lover undue; therefore is thy love buta lie.' However, it is her love for thee that lieth; for she sawthee asleep yet aroused thee not and were her love for thee true,she had indeed awoken thee.  As for the charcoal, it means 'Allahblacken thy face'[FN#504] for thou makest a lying presence oflove, whereas thou art naught but a child and hast no object inlife other than eating and drinking and sleeping!  such is theinterpretation of her signs, and may Allah Almighty deliver theefrom her!" When I heard my cousin's words, I beat my hand upon mybreast and cried out, "By Allah, this is the very truth, for Islept and lovers sleep not!  Indeed I have sinned against myself,for what could have wrought me more hurt than eating andsleeping?  Now what shall I do?" Then I wept sore and said to thedaughter of my uncle, "Tell me how to act and have pity on me, somay Allah have pity on thee: else I shall die." As my cousinloved me with very great love,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawnof day and ceased saying her permitted say.       When it was the One Hundred and Seventeenth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youngmerchant continued his tale to Taj al-Muluk: "Thereupon quoth Ito the daughter of my uncle, "Tell me what to do and have pity onme, so may Allah have pity on thee!" As the daughter of my uncleloved me with great love, she replied, "On my head and eyes! But, O my cousin, I repeat what I have told thee oftentimes, if Icould go in and out at will, I would at once bring you twotogether and cover you both with my skirt: nor would I do thisbut hoping to win thy favour.  Inshallah, I will do my utmostendeavour to unite you; but hear my words and do my bidding.  Gothou to the very same place and sit down where thou sattestbefore and at supper tide look thou eat not, for eating inducethsleep; and have a care-thou slumber not, for she will not come tothee till a fourth part of the night be passed.  And the Almightyavert her mischief from thee!" Now when I heard these words Irejoiced and besought Allah to hasten the night; and, as soon asit was dark, I was minded to go, and my cousin said to me, "Whenthou shalt have met her, repeat to her the couplet I taught theebefore, at the time of thy leave taking." Replied I, "On my headand eyes!" and went out and repaired to the garden, where I foundall made ready in the same state as on the previous night, withevery requisite of meat and drink, dried fruits, sweet scentedflowers and so forth.  I went up into the pavilion and smelt theodour of the viands and my spirit lusted after them; but Ipossessed my soul in patience for a while, till at last I couldno longer withstand temptation.  So I arose from my seat and wentup to the table and, raising its cover, found a dish of fowls,surrounded by four saucers containing four several meats.  I atea mouthful of each kind and as much as I would of the sweetmeatsand a piece of meat: then I drank from the saucer a sauceyellowed with saffron[FN#505] and as it pleased me, I supped itup by the spoonful till I was satisfied and my stomach was full. Upon this, my eyelids drooped; so I took a cushion and set itunder my head, saying, "Haply I can recline upon it without goingto sleep." Then I closed my eyes and slept, nor did I wake tillthe sun had risen, when I found on my stomach a cube ofbone,[FN#506] a single tip-cat stick,[FN#507] the stone of agreen date[FN#508] and a carob pod.  There was no furniture noraught else in the place, and it was as if there had been nothingthere yesterday.  So I rose and shaking all these things off me,fared forth in fury; and, going home, found my cousin groaningand versifying with these couplets,"A wasted body, heart enpierced to core, * And tears that down my     poor cheeks pour and pour:And lover cure of access; but, but still * Naught save what's     fair can come from fairest flow'r:O cousin mine thou fill'st my soul with pate, * And from these     tears mine eyelids ache full sore!"I chid the daughter of my uncle and abused her, whereat she wept;then, wiping away her tears, she came up to me and kissed me andbegan pressing me to her bosom, whilst I held back from herblaming myself.  Then said she to me, "O my cousin, it seemeththou sleptest again this night?" Replied I, "Yes; and when Iawoke, I found on my stomach a cube of bone, a single tip-catstick, a stone of a green date and a carob pod, and I know notwhy she did this." Then I wept and went up to her and said,"Expound to me her meaning in so doing and tell me how shall Iact and aid me in my sore strait." She answered, "On my head andeyes!  By the single tip cat stick and the cube of bone which sheplaced upon thy stomach she saith to thee 'Thy body is presentbut thy heart is absent'; and she meaneth, 'Love is not thus: sodo not reckon thyself among lovers.' As for the date stone, it isas if she said to thee, 'An thou wert in love thy heart would beburning with passion and thou wouldst not taste the delight ofsleep; for the sweet of love is like a green date[FN#509] whichkindleth a coal of fire in the vitals.' As for the carobpod[FN#510] it signifieth to thee, 'The lover's heart iswearied'; and thereby she saith, 'Be patient under our separationwith the patience of Job.' " When I heard this interpretation,fires darted into my vitals like a dart and grief redoubled uponmy heart and I cried out, saying, "Allah decreed sleep to me formy ill fortune." Then I said to her, "O my cousin, by my life,devise me some device whereby I may win my will of her!" She weptand answered, "O Aziz, O son of my uncle, verily my heart is fullof sad thought which I cannot speak: but go thou again to nightto the same place and beware thou sleep not, and thou shaltsurely attain thy desire.  This is my counsel and peace be withthee!" Quoth I, "If Allah please I will not sleep, but will do asthou biddest me." Then my cousin rose, and brought me food,saying, "Eat now what may suffice thee, that nothing may divertthy heart." So I ate my fill and, when night came, my cousin roseand bringing me a sumptuous suit of clothes clad me therein. Then she made me swear I would repeat to my lover the verseaforesaid and bade me beware of sleeping.  So I left her andrepaired to the garden and went up into that same pavilion whereI occupied myself in holding my eyelids open with my fingers andnodding my head as the night darkened on me."--And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.       When it was the One Hundred and Eighteenth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youngmerchant continued to Taj al Muluk: "So I repaired to the gardenand went up into that same pavilion and occupied myself in gazingupon the flower beds and in holding my eyelids open with myfingers and nodding my head as the night darkened on me.  Andpresently I grew hungry with watching and the smell of the meatsbeing wafted towards me, my appetite increased: so I went up tothe table and took off the cover and ate a mouthful of every dishand a bit of meat; after which I turned to the flagon of wine,saying to myself, I will drink one cup.  I drank it, and then Idrank a second and a third, till I had drunk full ten, when thecool air smote me and I fell to the earth like a felled man.  Iceased not to lie thus till day arose, when I awoke and foundmyself out side the garden, and on my stomach were a butcher'sknife and a dram-weight of iron.[FN#511]  Thereat I trembled and,taking them with me, went home, where I found my cousin saying,"Verily, I am in this house wretched and sorrowful, having nohelper but weeping." Now when I entered, I fell down at fulllength and throwing the knife and the dram weight from my hand, Ifainted clean away.  As soon as I came to myself, I told her whathad befallen me and said, Indeed, I shall never enjoy my desire."But when she saw my tears and my passion, they redoubled herdistress on my account, and she cried, "Verily, I am helpless!  Iwarned thee against sleeping; but thou wouldst not hearken to mywarning, nor did my words profit thee aught." I rejoined, "ByAllah, I conjure thee to explain to me the meaning of the knifeand the iron dram-weight." "By the dram weight," replied mycousin, "she alludeth to her right eye,[FN#512] and she swearethby it and saith, 'By the Lord of all creatures and by my righteye!  if thou come here again and sleep, I will cut thy throatwith this very knife.' And indeed I fear for thee, O my cousin,from her malice; my heart is full of anguish for thee and Icannot speak.  Nevertheless, if thou can be sure of thyself notto sleep when thou returnest to her, return to her and beware ofsleeping and thou shalt attain thy desire; but if when returningto her thou wilt sleep, as is thy wont, she will surely slaughterthee." Asked I, "What shall I do, O daughter of my uncle: I begthee, by Allah, to help me in this my calamity." Answered she,"On my head and eyes!  if thou wilt hearken to my words and do mybidding, thou shalt have thy will." Quoth I, "I will indeedhearken to thy words and do thy bidding;" and quoth she, "When itis time for thee to go, I will tell thee." Then she pressed me toher bosom and laying me on the bed, shampoo'd my feet, tilldrowsiness overcame me and I was drowned in sleep, then she tooka fan and seated herself at my head with the fan in her hand andshe was weeping till her clothes were wet with tears.  Now whenshe saw that I was awake, she wiped away the drops and fetched mesome food and set it before me.  I refused it, but she said tome, "Did I not tell thee that thou must do my bidding?  Eat!" SoI ate and thwarted her not and she proceeded to put the food intomy mouth and I to masticate it, till I was full.  Then she mademe drink jujube sherbet[FN#513] and sugar and washed my hands anddried them with a kerchief; after which she sprinkled me withrose water, and I sat with her awhile in the best of spirits. When the darkness had closed in, she dressed me and said to me,"O son of my uncle, watch through the whole night and sleep not;for she will not come to thee this tide till the last of the darkhours and, Allah willing, thou shalt be at one with her thisnight; but forget not my charge." Then, she wept, and my heartwas pained for her by reason of her over much weeping, and Iasked, "What is the charge thou gayest me?" She answered, "Whenthou takest leave of her repeat to her the verse beforementioned." So, full of joy I left her and repairing to thegarden, went up into the pavilion where, being satiated withfood, I sat down and watched till a fourth part of the dark hourswas past.  That night seemed longsome to me as it were a year:but I remained awake till it was three quarters spent and thecocks crew and I was famished for long watching.  Accordingly Iwent up to the table and ate my fill, whereupon my head grewheavy and I wanted to sleep, when behold, a light appeared makingtowards me from afar.  I sprang up and washed my hands and mouthand roused myself; and before long she came with ten damsels, inwhose midst she was like the full moon among the stars.  She wasclad in a dress of green satin purfled with red gold, and she wasas saith the poet,"She lords it o'er our hearts in grass green gown, * With     buttons[FN#514] loose and locks long flowing down.Quoth I, 'What is thy name?' Quoth she, 'I'm she, * Who burns the     lover-heart live coals upon:'I made my plaint to her of loving lowe; * Laughed she, 'To stone     thou moanest useless moan!'Quoth I, 'An be of hardest stone thy heart, * Allah drew sweetest     spring from hardest stone.' "When she saw me she laughed and said, "How is it that thou artawake and that sleep overcame thee not?  Forasmuch as thou hastwatched through the night, I know that thou art a lover; fornight watching is the mark of lovers displaying brave enduranceof their desires." Then she turned to her women and signed tothem and they went away from her, whereupon she came up to me andstrained me to her breast and kissed me, whilst I kissed her, andshe sucked my upper lip whilst I sucked her lower lip.  I put myhand to her waist and pressed it and we came not to the groundsave at the same moment.  Then she undid her petticoat trouserswhich slipped down to her anklets, and we fell to clasping andembracing and toying and speaking softly and biting and intertwining of legs and going round about the Holy House and thecorners thereof,[FN#515] till her joints became relaxed for lovedelight and she swooned away.  I entered the sanctuary, andindeed that night was a joy to the sprite and a solace to thesight even as saith the poet,"Sweetest of nights the world can show to me, that night * When     cups went round and round as fed by ceaseless spring:There utter severance made I 'twixt mine eyes and sleep, * And     joined, re joined mine ear drop with the anklet     ring."[FN#516]We lay together in close embrace till the morning when I wouldhave gone away, but she stopped me and said, "Stay till I tellthee something"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased saying her permitted say.       When it was the One Hundred and Nineteenth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youngmerchant continued his recital to Taj al Muluk: "When I wouldhave gone away, she stopped me and said, "Stay, till I tell theesomething and charge thee with a charge." So I stayed whilst sheunfolded a kerchief and drew out this piece of linen and spreadit open before me.  I found worked on it these two figures ofgazelles and admired it with great admiration.  Then I took thepiece of linen and went away, joyful, after we had agreed that Ishould visit her every night in the garden; but in my joy Iforgot to repeat to her the verse my cousin had taught me.  Forwhen giving me the piece of linen with the gazelles she had saidto me, "Keep this carefully, as it is my sister's handiwork." Iasked her, "What is thy sister's name?"; and she answered, "Hername is Nur al-Huda." When I went to my cousin, I found her lyingdown; but as soon as she saw me, she rose, with the tears runningfrom her eyes, and came up to me, and kissed me on the breast andsaid, "Didst thou do as I enjoined thee?  and repeat the verse toher?" "I forgot it," replied I; "and nothing drove it out of mymind but these two figured gazelles." And I threw the piece oflinen on the floor before her.  She rose and sat down again, butwas unable to contain herself for impatience, and her eyes ranover with tears, whilst she repeated these two couplets,"O thou who seekest parting, softly fare!  * Let not the Pair     delude with cunning art:Pare softly, Fortune's nature is to 'guile, * And end of every     meeting is to part."And when she ended her recitation she said, "O my cousin, give methis piece of linen." So I gave it to her and she took it andunfolding it, saw what was therein.  When the tryst time came formy going to my lover, the daughter of my uncle said to me, "Go,and peace attend thee; and when thou art about to leave her,recite to her the verse I taught thee long ago and which thoudidst forget." Quoth I, "Tell it me again"; and she repeated it. Then I went to the garden and entered the pavilion, where I foundthe young lad, awaiting me.  When she saw me, she rose and kissedme and made me sit in her lap; and we ate and drank and did ourdesire as before.  In the morning, I repeated to her my cousin'sverse which was this,"Ho, lovers all!  by Allah say me sooth * What shall he do when     Love sor' vexeth youth?"When she heard this, her eyes filled with tears and she answeredand said,"Strive he to cure his case, to hide the truth, * Patiently     humble self and sue for rush!"I committed it to memory and returned home rejoicing at havingdone my cousin's bidding.  When I entered the house I found herlying down and my mother at her head weeping over her case; butas soon as I went in to her my mother said to me, "A foul plagueon such a cousin!  How couldst thou leave the daughter of thyuncle ailing and not ask what ailed her?" But when my cousin sawme she raised her head and sat up and asked me, "O Aziz, didstthou repeat to her the couplet I taught thee?" I answered, "Yes,and when she heard it she wept and recited in answer anothercouplet which I committed to memory." Quoth my cousin, "Tell itme." I did so; and when she heard it she wept with much weepingand repeated the following verses,'How shall youth cure the care his life undo'th, * And every day     his heart in pieces hew'th?In sooth he would be patient, but he findeth * Naught save a     heart which love with pains imbu'th."Then added my cousin, "When thou goest to her as of wont, repeatto her also these two couplets which thou hast heard." I replied,"Hearkening and obedience!" and I went at the wonted time, to thegarden, where there passed between my mistress and myself whattongue faileth to describe.  When I was about to leave her, Irepeated to her those two couplets of my cousin's; whereupon thetears streamed from her eyes and she replied,"If he of patience fail the truth to hide * For him no cure save     Death my vision view'th!"I committed them to memory and returned home, and when I went into my cousin I found her fallen into a fit and my mother sittingat her head.  When she heard my voice, she opened her eyes andasked, "O Aziz! didst thou repeat the two couplets to her?"whereto I answered, "Yes; but she wept on hearing them and shereplied with this couplet beginning, If he of patience fail, tothe end." And I repeated it; whereupon my cousin swooned again,and when she came to herself, she recited these two couplets,"Hearkening, obeying, with my dying mouth * I greet who joy of     union ne'er allow'th:Pair fall all happy loves, and fair befal * The hapless lover     dying in his drowth!"Again when it was night, I repaired to the garden as usual whereI found the young lady awaiting me.  We sat down and ate anddrank, after which we did all we wanted and slept till themorning; and, as I was going away, I repeated to her the sayingof my cousin.  When she heard the couplet she cried out with aloud cry and was greatly moved and exclaimed, "Awah! Awah![FN#517]  By Allah, she who spake these lines is dead!" Thenshe wept and said to me, "Woe to thee!  How is she who spoke thusrelated to thee?" Replied I, "She is the daughter of my father'sbrother." "Thou liest," rejoined she; "by Allah, were she thycousin, thou hadst borne her the same love as she bore thee!  Itis thou who hast slain her and may the Almighty kill thee as thoukilledst her!  By Allah, hadst thou told me thou hadst a cousin,I would not have admitted thee to my favours!" Quoth I, "Verilyit was she who interpreted to me the signs thou madest and it wasshe who taught me how to come to thee and how I should deal withthee; and, but for her, I should never have been united to thee."She then asked me, "Did thy cousin then know of us?"; and Ianswered, "Yes;" whereupon she exclaimed, "Allah give thee sorrowof thy youth, even as thou hast sorrowed her youth!" Then shecried to me, "Go now and see after her." So I went away troubledat heart, and ceased not walking till I reached our street, whenI heard sounds of wailing, and asking about it, was answered,"Azizah, we found her dead behind the door." I entered the house,and when my mother saw me, she said, "Her death lieth heavy onthy neck and may Allah not acquit thee of her blood!"--AndShahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying herpermitted say.        When it was the One Hundred and Twentieth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youngmerchant continued to Taj al-Muluk: "So I entered the house andwhen my mother saw me she said, "Her death lieth heavy on thyneck and may Allah not acquit thee of her blood!  A plague onsuch a cousin!" Then came my father, and we laid her out and getready her bier and buried her; and we had recitations of thewhole Koran over her tomb and we abode by her grave three days,after which we returned to our home, and I grieving for hergrievously.  Then my mother came to me and said, "I would fainknow what thou didst to her, to break her heart[FN#518] for, O myson, I questioned her at all times of the cause of her complaint,but she would tell me nothing nor let me know aught of it.  SoAllah upon thee, tell me what thou hast been doing to her thatshe died." Quoth I, "I did nothing." Quoth my mother, "Allahavenge her on thee!  Verily she told me naught, but kept hersecret till she died of her love longings for thee; but when shedied I was with her and she opened her eyes and said to me; 'Owife of my uncle may Allah hold thy son guiltless of my blood andpunish him not for what he hath done by me!  And now Allahtransporteth me from the house of the world which is perishableto the house of the other world which is eternal.' Said I, 'O mydaughter, Allah preserve thee and preserve thy youth!' And as Iquestioned her of the cause of her illness, she made me noanswer; but she smiled and said, 'O wife of my uncle, bid thyson, whenever he would go whither he goeth every day, repeatthese two saws at his going away; 'Faith is fair!  Unfaith isfoul!' For this is of my tender affection to him, that I amsolicitous concerning him during my lifetime and after my death.'Then she gave me somewhat for thee and sware me that I would notgive it until I see thee weeping for her and lamenting her death. The thing is with me; and, when I have seen thy case as I havesaid, I will make it over to thee." "Show it me," cried I: butshe would not.  Then I gave myself up to love delights andthought no more of my cousin's death: for my mind was unsettledand fain would I have been with my lover the livelong day andnight.[FN#519]  So hardly had I perceived the darkness fall whenI betook myself to the garden, where I found the young ladysitting on coals of fire for much impatience.  As soon as she wassure that she saw me, she ran to me and throwing her arms aboutmy neck, enquired of the daughter of my uncle.  I replied, "Soothto say she is dead, and we have caused Zikr- litanies andrecitations of the Koran to be performed for her; and it is nowfour nights and this be the fifth since she is gone." When sheheard that, she shrieked aloud and wept and said, "Did I not tellthee that thou hast slain her?  Hadst thou let me know of herbefore her death, I would have requited her the kindness she didme, in that she served me and united thee to me; for without her,we had never foregathered, we twain, and I fear lest somecalamity befal thee because of thy sin against her." Quoth I,"She acquitted me of offence ere she died;" and I repeated to herwhat my mother had told me.  Quoth she, "Allah upon thee!  whenthou returnest to thy mother, learn what thing she keepeth forthee." I rejoined, "My mother also said to me; 'Before thedaughter of thy uncle died, she laid a charge upon me, saying,Whenever thy son would go whither he is wont to go, teach himthese two saws, 'Faith is fair; Unfaith is foul!' " When my ladyheard this she exclaimed, "The mercy of Almighty Allah be uponher!  Indeed, she hath delivered thee from me, for I minded to dothee a mischief, but now I will not harm thee nor trouble thee."I wondered at this and asked her, "What then west thou minded todo with me in time past and we two being in bond of love?"Answered she, "Thou art infatuated with me; for thou art young inlife and a raw laddie; thy heart is void of guile and thouweetest not our malice and deceit.  Were she yet alive, she wouldprotect thee; for she is the cause of thy preservation and shehath delivered thee from destruction.  And now I charge theespeak not with any woman, neither accost one of our sex, be sheyoung or be she old; and again I say Beware!  for thou art simpleand raw and knowest not the wiles of women and their malice, andshe who interpreted the signs to thee is dead.  And indeed I fearfor thee, lest thou fall into some disgrace and find none todeliver thee from it, now that the daughter of thy uncle is nomore."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to sayher permitted say.      When it was the One Hundred and Twenty-first Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youngmerchant continued to Taj al-Muluk: "Then the young lady said tome, "I fear for thee lest thou fall into some disgrace and findnone to deliver thee from it.  Alas for thy cousin and ah, thepity of her!  Would I had known her before her death, that Imight have requited by waiting upon her the fair service she didme.  The mercy of Allah Almighty be upon her, for she kept hersecret and revealed not what she suffered, and but for her thouhadst never foregathered with me; no, never!  But there is onething I desire of thee." I asked, "What is it?"; and sheanswered, "It is that thou bring me to her grave, that I mayvisit her in the tomb wherein she is and write some coupletsthereon." I rejoined, "To morrow, if Allah please!"[FN#520]  Islept with her that night, and she ceased not saying after everyhour, "Would thou hadst told me of thy cousin before her death!"And I asked her, "What is the meaning of the two saws she taughtme?  'Faith is fair!  Unfaith is foul!'" But she made no answer. As soon as it was day she rose and, taking a purse of goldpieces, said to me, "Come, show me her tomb, that I may visit itand grave some verses thereon and build a dome over it andcommend her to Allah's mercy and bestow these diners in alms forher soul." I replied, "To hear is to obey!"; and walked on beforeher, whilst she followed me, giving alms as she went and sayingto all upon whom she lavisht bounty, "This is an alms for thesoul of Azizah, who kept her counsel till she drank the cup ofdeath and never told the secret of her love." And she stinted notthus to give alms and say, "for Azizah's soul," till the pursewas empty and we came to the grave.  And when she looked at thetomb, she wept and threw herself on it; then, pulling out achisel of steel and a light hammer, she graved therewith upon thehead stone in fine small characters these couplets,"I past by a broken tomb amid a garth right sheen, * Whereon     seven blooms of Nu'uman[FN#521] glowed with cramoisie;Quoth I, 'Who sleepeth in this tomb?' Quoth answering Earth *     'Before a lover Hades-tombed[FN#522] bend reverently!'Quoth I, 'May Allah help thee, O thou slain of Love, * And grant     thee home in Heaven and Paradise height to see!'Hapless are lovers all e'en tombed in their tombs, * Where amid     living folk the dust weighs heavily!Pain would I plant a garden blooming round thy grave, * And water     every flower with tear drops flowing free!"Then she turned away in tears and I with her and returned to thegarden where she said to me, "By Allah!  I conjure thee neverleave me!" "To hear is to obey," replied I.  Then I gave myselfwholly up to her and paid her frequent visits: she was good andgenerous to me; and as often as I passed the night with her, shewould make much of me and would ask me of the two saws my cousinAzizah told my mother and I would repeat them to her.  Andmatters ceased not to be on this wise and I continued for a wholeyear eating and drinking and enjoying dalliance and wearingchange of rich raiment until I waxed gross and fat, so that Ilost all thought of sorrowing and mourning, and I clean forgot mycousin Azizah.  And on New Year's day I went to the bath, where Irefreshed myself and put on a suit of sumptuous clothes; thencoming out I drank a cup of wine and smelt the scent of my newgear which was perfumed with various essences; and my breast wasbroadened thereby, for I knew not the tricks of Pate nor thechanging ways of Time.  When the hour of night prayer came, I wasminded to repair to my lover; but, being the worse for wine, Iknew not when going to her whither I went, so my drunkennessturned me into a by street called Syndic Street;[FN#523] and thewhile I walked up that street behold, I caught sight of an oldwoman faring with a lighted taper in one hand, and in the other afolded letter.--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased saying her permitted say.      When it was the One Hundred and Twenty-second Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youngmerchant, whose name was Aziz, continued to Taj al-Muluk:--Andwhen I entered the street called Syndic Street behold, I caughtsight of an old woman walking with a lighted taper in one handand in the other a folded letter and I drew near her and lo!  shewas weeping and repeating these couplets,"O glad news bearer well come!  Welcome!  Hail!  * How sweet thy     speech to me, what treat thy tale:O messenger from him whose weal I love, * God bless thee long as     breathes soft morning-gale!"Now when she saw me she asked, "O my son! canst thou read?"; andI answered, of my officiousness, "Yes, old naunty!" Rejoined she,"Then take this letter and read it to me." And when she handed itto me, I took it and unfolding it read it to her and behold itwas from an absent man to his friends and lovers whom he greeted;and, when she heard its purport, she rejoiced at the good tidingsand blessed me, saying, "Allah dispel thine anxiety, even as thouhast dispelled mine!" Then she took the letter and walked on. Meanwhile, I was urged by a call of nature and sat down on myheels to make water.[FN#524] When I had ended I stood up andwiped the orifice with a pebble and then, letting down myclothes, I was about to wend my way, when suddenly the old womancame up to me again and, bending down over my hand, kissed it andsaid, "O my master!  the Lord give thee joy of thy youth!  Ientreat thee to walk with me a few steps as far as yonder door,for I told them what thou didst read to me of the letter, andthey believe me not, so come with me two steps and read them theletter from behind the door and accept the prayers of a righteouswoman." I enquired, "What is the history of this letter?", andshe replied, "O my son, this letter is from my son, who hath beenabsent for a term of ten years.  He set out with a stock ofmerchandise and tarried long in foreign parts, till we lost hopeof him and supposed him to be dead.  Now after all that delaycometh this letter from him, and he hath a sister who weepeth forhim night and day; so I said to her, 'He is well and all right.'But she will not believe me and declares, 'There is no help butthou bring me one who will read this letter in my presence, thatmy heart may be at rest and my mind at ease.' Thou knowest, O myson, that all who love are wont to think evil: so be good enoughto go with me and read to her this letter, standing behind thecurtain, whilst I call his sister to listen within the door, soshalt thou dispel our heed and fulfil our need.  Verily quoth theApostle of Allah (whom Allah bless and preserve!), 'Whoso easeththe troubled of one of the troubles of this troublous world,Allah will ease him of an hundred troubles'; and according toanother tradition, 'Whoso easeth his brother of one of thetroubles of this troublous world, Allah shall relieve him ofseventy and two troubles on the Day of Resurrection.' And I havebetaken myself to thee; so disappoint me not." Replied I, "Tohear is to obey: do thou go before me!" So she walked ondevancing me and I followed her a little way, till she came tothe gate of a large and handsome mansion whose door was platedwith copper.[FN#525]  I stood behind the door, whilst the oldwoman cried out in Persian, and ere I knew it a damsel ran upwith light and nimble step.  She had tucked up her trousers toher knees, so that I saw a pair of calves that confounded thinkerand lighter, and the maid herself was as saith the poetdescribing her,"O thou who barest leg calf, better to suggest * For passion     madded amourist better things above!Towards its lover cloth the bowl go round and run; * Cup[FN#526]     and cup bearer only drive us daft with love."[FN#527]Now these legs were like two pillars of alabaster adorned withanklets of gold, wherein were set stones of price.  And thedamsel had tucked up the end of her gown under her arm pit andhad rolled up her sleeves to the elbow, so that I could see herwhite wrists whereon were two pairs of bracelets with clasps ofgreat pearls; and round her neck was a collar of costly gems. Her ears were adorned with pendants of pearls and on her head shewore a kerchief[FN#528] of brocade, brand new and broidered withjewels of price.  And she had thrust the skirt of her shift intoher trousers string being busy with some household business.  Sowhen I saw her in this undress, I was confounded at her beauty,for she was like a shining sun.  Then she said, with soft, choicespeech, never heard I sweeter, "O my mother!  is this he whocometh to read the letter?" "It is," replied the old woman; andshe put out her hand to me with the letter.  Now between her andthe door was a distance of about half a rod[FN#529]; so Istretched forth my hand to take the letter from her and thrusthead and shoulders within the door, thinking to draw near her andread the letter when, before I knew what her design was, the oldwoman butted her head against my back and pushed me forwards withthe letter in my hand, so that ere I could take thought I foundmyself in the middle of the hall far beyond the vestibule.  Thenshe entered, faster than a flash of blinding leven, and hadnaught to do but to shut the door.  And Shahrazed perceived thedawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.      When it was the One Hundred and Twenty-third Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youthAziz pursued to Taj al Muluk: "When the old woman pushed meforwards I found myself, ere I could think, inside the vestibule;and the old woman entered faster than a flash of blinding leveeand had naught to do but to shut the door.  When the girl saw mein the vestibule, she came up to me and strained me to her bosom,and threw me to the floor; then she sat astraddle upon my breastand kneaded my belly with her fingers, till I well nigh lost mysenses.  Thereupon she took me by the hand and led me, unable toresist for the violence of her pressure, through sevenvestibules, whilst the old woman forewent us with the lightedcandle, till we came to a great saloon with four estrades whereona horseman might play Polo.[FN#530] Here she released me, saying,"Open thine eyes." So I opened them still giddy for the excess ofher embracing and pressing, and saw that the whole saloon wasbuilt of the finest marbles and alabasters, and all its furniturewas of silk and brocade even to the cushions and mattresses. Therein also were two benches of yellow brass and a couch of redgold, set with pearls and precious stones, befitting none saveKings like thyself.  And off the saloon were smaller sittingrooms; and the whole place was redolent of wealth.  Then sheasked, "O Aziz, which is liefer to thee life or death?" "Life,"answered I; and she said, "If life be liefer to thee, marry me."Quoth I, "Indeed I should hate to marry the like of thee." Quothshe, "If thou marry me thou wilt at least be safe from thedaughter of Dalilah the Wily One."[FN#531]  I asked, "And who bethat daughter of the Wily One?" Whereupon she laughed andreplied, " 'Tis she who hath companied with thee this day for ayear and four months (may the Almighty destroy and afflict herwith one worse than herself!) By Allah, there liveth not a moreperfidious than she.  How many men hath she not slain before theeand what deeds hath she not done.  Nor can I understand how thouhast been all the time in her company, yet she hath not killedthee nor done thee a mischief." When I heard her words, Imarvelled with exceeding marvel and said, "O my lady, who madethee to know her?"  Said she, "I know her as the age knoweth itscalamities; but now I would fain have thee tell me all that hathpassed between you two, that I may ken the cause of thydeliverance from her." So I told her all that had happenedbetween us, including the story of my cousin Azizah.  Sheexpressed her pity when she heard of the death, and her eyes ranover with tears and she claps hand on hand and cried out, Heryouth was lost on Allah's way,[FN#532] and may the Lord blessthee for her good works!  By Allah, O Aziz, she who died for theewas the cause of thy preservation from the daughter of Dalia theWily; and, but for her, thou hadst been lost.  And now she isdead I fear for thee from the Crafty One's perfidy and mischief;but my throat is choking and I cannot speak." Quoth I Ay, byAllah: all this happened even as thou sayest." And she shook herhead and cried, "There liveth not this day the like of Azizah.  Icontinued, "And on her death bed she bade me repeat to my loverthese two saws, 'Faith is fair!  Unfaith is foul'" When she heardme say this, she exclaimed, "O Aziz, by Allah those same wordssaved thee from dying by her hand; and now my heart is at easefor thee from her, for she will never kill thee and the daughterof thy uncle preserved thee during her lifetime and after herdeath.  By Allah, I have desired thee day after day but could notget at thee till this time when I tricked thee and outwittedthee; for thou art a raw youth[FN#533] and knowest not the wilesof young women nor the deadly guile of old women." Rejoined I,No, by Allah!" Then said she to me, "Be of good cheer and eyesclear; the dead hath found Allah's grace, and the live shall bein good case.  Thou art a handsome youth and I do not desire theebut according to the ordinance of Allah and His Apostle (on whombe salutation and salvation!).  Whatever thou requirest of moneyand stuff, thou shalt have forthright without stint, and I willnot impose any toil on thee, no, never!, for there is with mealways bread baked hot and water in pot.  All I need of thee isthat thou do with me even as the cock doth." I asked "And whatdoth the cock?" Upon this she laughed and clapped her hands andfell over on her back for excess of merriment then she sat up andsmiled and said, "O light of my eyes, really dost thou not knowwhat cock's duty is?" "No, by Allah!" replied I, and she, "Thecock's duty is to eat and drink and tread.' I was abashed at herwords and asked, "Is that the cock's duty?  Yes, answered she;"and all I ask of thee now is to gird thy loins and strengthenthy will and futter thy best." Then she clapped her hands andcried out, saying, "O my mother, bring forward those who are withthee." And behold, in came the old woman accompanied by fourlawful witnesses, and carrying a veil of silk.  Then she lightedfour candles, whilst the witnesses saluted me and sat down; andthe girl veiled herself with the veil and deputed one of them toexecute the contract on her behalf.  So they wrote out themarriage bond and she testified to have received the whole sumsettled upon her, both the half in advance and the half inarrears; and that she was indebted to me in the sum of tenthousand dirhams.--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day andceased saying her permitted say.      When it was the One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youngmerchant continued to Taj al-Muluk: When they wrote out themarriage contract, she testified to having received the whole sumsettled upon her, the half in advance and the half in arrears andthat she was indebted to me in the sum of ten thousand dirhams. She paid the witnesses their wage and they withdrew whence theycame.  Thereupon she arose and cast off her clothes and stood ina chemise of fine silk edged with gold lace, after which she tookoff her trousers and seized my hand and led me up to the couch,saying, "There is no sin in a lawful put in." She lay down on thecouch outspread upon her back; and, drawing me on to her breast,heaved a sigh and followed it up with a wriggle by way of beingcoy.  Then she pulled up the shift above her breasts, and when Isaw her in this pose, I could not withhold myself from thrustingit into her, after I had sucked her lips, whilst she whimperedand shammed shame and wept when no tears came, and then said she,"O my beloved, do it, and do thy best!" Indeed the case remindedme of his saying, who said,"When I drew up her shift from the roof of her coynte, * I found     it as strait* as my mind and my money:So I drove it half-way, and she sighed a loud sigh * Quoth I,     'Why this sigh?': 'For the rest of it, honey!'"And she repeated, "O my beloved, let the finish be made for I amthine handmaid.  My life on thee, up with it!  give it me, all ofit!  that I may take it in my hand and thrust it into my veryvitals!" And she ceased not to excite me with sobs and sighs andamorous cries in the intervals of kissing and clasping until amidour murmurs of pleasure we attained the supreme delight and theterm we had in sight.  We slept together till the morning, when Iwould have gone out; but lo!  she came up to me, laughing, andsaid, "So! So! thinkest thou that going into the Hammam is thesame as going out?[FN#534]  Dost thou deem me to be the like ofthe daughter of Dalilah the Wily One?  Beware of such a thought,for thou art my husband by contract and according to law.  Ifthou be drunken return to thy right mind, and know that the housewherein thou art openeth but one day in every year.  Go down andlook at the great door." So I arose and went down and found thedoor locked and nailed up and returned and told her of thelocking and nailing.  "O Aziz," said she, "We have in this houseflour, grain, fruits and pomegranates; sugar, meat, sheep,poultry and so forth enough for many years; and the door will notbe opened till after the lapse of a whole twelvemonth and well Iweet thou shalt not find thyself without this house till then."Quoth I "There is no Majesty, and there is no Might save inAllah, the Glorious, the Great!" "And how can this harm thee,"rejoined she; "seeing thou knowest cock's duty, whereof I toldthee?" Then she laughed and I laughed too, and I conformed towhat she said and abode with her, doing cock's duty and eatingand drinking and futtering for a year of full twelve months,during which time she conceived by me, and I was blessed with ababe by her.  On the New Year's day I heard the door opened andbehold, men came in with cakes and flour and sugar.  Upon this, Iwould have gone out but my wife said, "Wait till supper tide andgo out even as thou camest in." So I waited till the hour ofnight prayer and was about to go forth in fear and trembling,when she stopped me, saying, "By Allah, I will not let thee gountil thou swear to come back this night before the closing ofthe door." I agreed to this, and she swore me a solemn oath onBlade and Book,[FN#535] and the oath of divorce to boot, that Iwould return to her.  Then I left her and going straight to thegarden, found the door open as usual; where at I was angry andsaid to myself, "I have been absent this whole year and come hereunawares and find the place open as of wont!  I wonder is thedamsel still here as before?  I needs must enter and see before Igo to my mother, more by reason that it is now nightfall." So Ientered the flower garden,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn ofday and ceased to say her permitted say.End of Vol. 2.                       Volume 2 Footnotes[FN#1] Supplementarily to note 2, p. 2, [FN#2 Vol 1]and note 2,p. 14, [FN#21 Vol 1] vol. i., I may add that "Shahrazad," in theShams al-Loghat, is the P.N. of a King. L. Langles (Les Voyagesde Sindibad Le Marin et La Ruse des Femmes, first appended toSavary's Grammar and reprinted 12 mot pp. 161 + 113, ImprimerieRoyale, Paris, M.D.CCC.XIV) explains it by Le cypres, la beautede la ville; and he is followed by (A. de Biberstein) Kazimirski(Ends el-Djelis Paris, Barrois, 1847). Ouseley (Orient. Collect.)makes Shahrzad=town-born; and others an Arabisation of Chehr-azad(free of face, ingenuous of countenance) the petit nom of QueenHumay, for whom see the Terminal Essay. The name of the sister,whom the Fihrist converts into a Kahramanah, or nurse, vulgarlywritten Dinar-zad, would= child of gold pieces, freed by goldpieces, or one who has no need of gold pieces: Dinzad=child offaith and Daynazad, proposed by Langles, "free from debt (!)" Ihave adopted Macnaghten's Dunyazad. "Shahryar," which Scotthideously writes "Shier ear," is translated by the Shams, King ofthe world, absolute monarch and the court of Anushir wan whilethe Burhan-i-Kati'a renders it a King of Kings, and P.N. of atown. Shahr-baz is also the P.N. of a town in Samarcand.[FN#2] Arab. "Malik," here used as in our story-books: "Pompeywas a wise and powerful King" says the Gesta Romanorum. This Kingis, as will appear, a Regent or Governor under Harun al-Rashid.In the next tale he is Viceroy of Damascus, where he is alsocalled "Sultan."[FN#3] The Bull Edit. gives the lines as follows:---      The lance was his pen, and the hearts of his foes *         His paper, and dipped he in blood for ink;     Hence our sires entitled the spear Khattiyah, *         Meaning that withal man shall write, I think.The pun is in "Khattiyah" which may mean a writer (feminine) andalso a spear, from Khatt Hajar, a tract in the provinceAl-Bahrayn (Persian Gulf), and Oman, where the best Indianbamboos were landed and fashioned into lances. Imr al-Keys(Mu'allakah v. 4.) sings of "our dark spears firmly wrought ofKhattiyan cane;" Al-Busiri of "the brown lances of Khatt;" alsosee Lebid v. 50 and Hamasah pp. 26, 231, Antar notes the "Spearsof Khatt" and "Rudaynian lances." Rudaynah is said to have beenthe wife of one Samhar, the Ferrara of lances; others make herthe wife of Al-Ka'azab and hold Sambar to be a town in Abyssiniawhere the best weapons were manufactured The pen is the Calamusor Kalam (reed cut for pen) of which the finest and hardest arebrought from Java: they require the least ribbing. The rhetoricalfigure in the text is called Husn al-Ta'alil, our aetiology; andis as admirable to the Arabs as it appears silly to us.[FN#4] "He loves folk" is high praise, meaning something morethan benevolence and beneficence.. Like charity it covers a hostof sins.[FN#5] The sentence is euphuistic.[FN#6] Arab. "Rubb"=syrup a word Europeanised by the "RobLaffecteur."[FN#7] The Septentriones or four oxen and their wain.[FN#8] The list fatally reminds us of "astronomy and the use ofthe globes" . . . "Shakespeare and the musical glasses."[FN#9] The octave occurs in Night xv. I quote Torrens (p. 360) byway of variety.[FN#10] A courteous formula of closing with the offer.[FN#11] To express our "change of climate" Easterns say, "changeof water and air," water coming first.[FN#12] "The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon bynight" (Psalm cxxi. 6). Easterns still believe in the blightingeffect of the moon's rays, which the Northerners of Europe, whoview it under different conditions, are pleased to deny. I haveseen a hale and hearty Arab, after sitting an hour in themoonlight, look like a man fresh from a sick bed; and I knew anEnglishman in India whose face was temporarily paralysed bysleeping with it exposed to the moon.[FN#13] The negroids and negroes of Zanzibar.[FN#14] i.e. Why not make thy heart as soft as thy sides! Theconverse of this was reported at Paris during the Empire, when aman had by mistake pinched a very high personage: "Ah, Madame! ifyour heart be as hard as (what he had pinched) I am a lost man."[FN#15] "Na'iman" is said to one after bathing or head-shaving:the proper reply, for in the East every sign of ceremony has itscountersign, is "Allah benefit thee!" (Pilgrimage i. 11, iii.285; Lane M. E. chaps. viii.; Caussin de Perceval's ArabicGrammar, etc., etc.) I have given a specimen (Pilgrimage i., 122)not only of sign and countersign, but also of the rhymingrepartee which rakes love. Hanien ! (pleasant to thee! said whena man drinks). Allah pleasure thee (Allah yuhannik which Arnautsand other ruffians perverted to Allah yanik, Allah copulate withthee); thou drinkest for ten!ÄI am the cock and thou art the hen!(i.e. a passive catamite)ÄNay, I am the thick one (the peniswhich gives pleasure) and thou art the thin! And so forth withmost unpleasant pleasantries.[FN#16] In the old version she is called "The Fair Persian,"probably from the owner: her name means "The Cheerer of theCompanion."[FN#17] Pronounce "Nooraddeen." I give the name written inArabic.[FN#18] Amongst Moslems, I have said, it is held highlydisgraceful when the sound of women's cries can be heard byoutsiders.[FN#19] In a case like this, the father would be justified byRasm (or usage) not by Koranic law, in playing Brutus with hisson. The same would be the case in a detected intrigue with apaternal concubine and, in very strict houses, with a slave-girl.[FN#20] Orientals fear the "Zug" or draught as much as Germans;and with even a better reason. Draughts are most dangerous in hotclimates.[FN#21] The Unity of the Godhead and the Apostleship of Mohammed.[FN#22] This would be done only in the case of the very poor.[FN#23] Prayers over the dead are not universal in Al-Islam; butwhen they are recited they lack the "sijdah" or prostration.[FN#24] Or, "Of the first and the last," i.e. Mohammed, whoclaimed (and claimed justly) to be the "Seal" or head and end ofall Prophets and Prophecy. For note that whether the Arab be heldinspired or a mere imposter, no man making the same pretensionhas moved the world since him. Mr. J. Smith the Mormon (tomention one in a myriad) made a bold attempt and failed.[FN#25] i.e. flatterers.[FN#26] In one matter Moslems contrast strongly with Christians,by most scrupulously following the example of their law-giver:hence they are the model Conservatives. But (European)Christendom is here, as in other things, curiously contradictory:for instance, it still keeps a "Feast of the Circumcision," andpractically holds circumcision in horror. Eastern Christians,however, have not wholly abolished it, and the Abyssinians, whofind it a useful hygenic precaution, still practise it. Forulcers, syphilis and other venereals which are readily cured inEgypt become dangerous in the Highlands of Ethiopia.[FN#27] Arab. "Sabab," the orig. and material sense of the word;hence "a cause," etc.[FN#28] Thus he broke his promise to his father, and it isinsinuated that retribution came upon him.[FN#29] "O Pilgrim" (Ya Hajj) is a polite address even to thosewho have not pilgrimaged. The feminine "Hajjah" (in Egyptpronounced "Haggeh") is similarly used.[FN#30] Arab. "usul"=roots, i.e. I have not forgotten mybusiness.[FN#31] Moslems from Central and Western North Africa.(Pilgrimage i. 261; iii. 7, etc); the "Jabarti" is the MoslemAbyssinian.[FN#32] This is a favourite bit of chaff and is to be lengthenedout almost indefinitely e.g. every brown thing is not civet norevery shining thing a diamond; every black thing is not charcoalnor every white chalk; every red thing is not a ruby nor everyyellow a topaz; every long-necked thing is not a camel, etc.,etc., etc.[FN#33] He gives him the name of his grandfather; a familiarusage.[FN#34] Arab. "Ma'janah," a place for making unbaked bricks(Tob=Span. Adobe) with chaff and bruised or charred straw. Theuse of this article in rainless lands dates from ages immemorial,and formed the outer walls of the Egyptian temple.[FN#35] Arab. "Barsh," a bit of round matting used by the poor asa seat. The Wazir thus showed that he had been degraded to thecondition of a mat-maker.[FN#36] The growth (a Poa of two species) which named Wady Halfa(vulg. "Halfah"), of which the home public has of late heardperhaps a trifle too much. Burckhardt (Prov. 226) renders it "dryreeds" -incorrectly enough.[FN#37] This "Hashimi" vein, as they call it, was an abnormaldevelopment between the eyes of the house of Abbas, inheritedfrom the great- grandfather of the Prophet; and the latter had itremarkably large, swelling in answer and battle-rage. The text,however, may read "The sweat of wrath," etc.[FN#38] Torrens and Payne prefer "Ilm"=knowledge. Lane has morecorrectly "Alam"=a sign, a flag.[FN#39] The lines were in Night xi.: I have quoted Torrens (p.379) for a change.[FN#40] Still customary in Tigris-Euphrates land, where sea-crafthas not changed since the days of Xisisthrus-Noah, and longbefore.[FN#41] To cool the contents.[FN#42] Hence the Khedivial Palace near Cairo "Kasr al-Nuzhah;"literally, "of Delights;" one of those flimsy new-Cairo buildingswhich contrast so marvellously with the architecture of ancientand even of mediaeval Egypt, and which are covering the land withmodern ruins. Compare Mohammed Ali's mosque in the citadel withthe older Sultan Hasan. A popular tale is told that, when theconquering Turk, Yawuz Sultan Selim, first visited Cairo, theyled him to Mosque Al-Ghuri. "This is a splendid Ka'ah (saloon)!"quoth he. When he entered Sultan Hasan, he exclaimed, "This is acitadel!"; but after inspecting the Mosque Al-Mu'ayyad he cried,"'Tis a veritable place of prayer, a fit stead for the Faithfulto adore the Eternal!"[FN#43] Arab. gardeners are very touchy on this point. A friendof mine was on a similar occasion addressed, in true Egyptianlingo, by an old Adam-son, "Ya ibn al-Kalb! beta'mil ay?" (O dog-son, what art thou up to?).[FN#44] "The green palm-stick is of the trees of Paradise;" saythe Arabs in Solomonic style but not Solomonic words: so our"Spare the rod," etc.[FN#45] Wayfarers, travellers who have a claim on the kindness ofthose at home: hence Abd al-Rahman al-Burai sings in his famousOde:-- He hath claim on the dwellers in the places of their birth, *Whoso wandereth the world, for he lacketh him a home.It is given in my "First Footsteps in East Africa" (pp. 53-55).[FN#46] The good old man treated the youth like a tired child.[FN#47] In Moslem writings the dove and turtle-dove are mostlyfeminine, whereas the female bird is always mute and only themale sings to summon or to amuse his mate.[FN#48] An unsavoury comparison of the classical Narcissus withthe yellow white of a nigger's eyes.[FN#49] A tree whose coals burn with fierce heat: Al-Hariri (VthSeance). This Artemisia is like the tamarisk but a smaller growthand is held to be a characteristic of the Arabian Desert. ABadawi always hails with pleasure the first sight of the Ghaza,after he has sojourned for a time away from his wilds. Mr.Palgrave (i. 38) describes the "Ghada" as an Euphorbia with awoody stem often 5-6 feet high and slender, flexible green twigs(?), "forming a feathery tuft, not ungraceful to the eye, whileit affords some shelter to the traveller, and food to hiscamels."[FN#50] Arab. "Sal'am"=S(alla) A(llah) a(layhi) was S(allam);A(llah) b(less) h(im) a(nd) k(eep)=Allah keep him and assain![FN#51] The ass is held to be ill-omened. I have noticed thebraying elsewhere. According to Mandeville the Devil did notenter the Ark with the Ass, but he left it when Noah said"Benedicite." In his day (A.D. 1322) and in that of Benjamin ofTudela, people had seen and touched the ship on Ararat, the Judi(Gordiaei) mountains; and this dates from Berosus (S.C. 250) who,of course, refers to the Ark of Xisisthrus. See Josephus Ant. i.3, 6; and Rodwell (Koran, pp. 65, 530).[FN#52] As would happen at a "Zikr," rogation or litany. Thosewho wish to see how much can be made of the subject will read"Pearls of the Faith, or Islam's Rosary, being the ninety-ninebeautiful names of Allah" (Asma-el-Husna) etc. by Edwin Arnold:London, Trubner, 1883.[FN#53] i.e. the Saki, cup-boy or cup-bearer. "Moon-faced," as Ihave shown elsewhere, is no compliment in English, but it is inPersian and Arabic.[FN#54] He means we are "Zahiri," plain honest Moslems, not"Batini," gnostics (ergo reprobates) and so forth, who disregardall appearances and external ordinances. This suggests hisopinion of Shaykh Ibrahim and possibly refers to Ja'afar'ssuspected heresy.[FN#55] This worthy will be noticed in a subsequent page.[FN#56] Arab. "Lisam," the end of the "Kufiyah," or head-kerchiefpassed over the face under the eyes and made fast on the otherside. This mouth-veil serves as a mask (eyes not beingrecognisable) and defends from heat, cold and thirst. I alsobelieve that hooding the eyes with this article, Badawi-fashion,produces a sensation of coolness, at any rate a marked differenceof apparent temperature; somewhat like a pair of dark spectaclesor looking at the sea from a sandy shore. (Pilgrimage i., 210 and346.) The woman's "Lisam" (chin-veil) or Yashmak is noticed ini., 337. [FN#57] Most characteristic is this familiarity between thegreatest man then in the world and his pauper subject. Thefisherman alludes to a practise of Al-Islman, instituted byCaliph Omar, that all rulers should work at some handicraft inorder to spare the public treasure. Hence Sultan Mu'ayyad ofCairo was a calligrapher who sold his handwriting, and hisexample was followed by the Turkish Sultans Mahmud, Abd al-Majidand Abd al-Aziz. German royalties prefer carpentering and LouisXVI, watch-making.[FN#58] There would be nothing singular in this request. Thedemocracy of despotism levels all men outside the pale ofpolitics and religion.[FN#59] "Wa'llahi tayyib!" an exclamation characteristic of theEgyptian Moslem.[FN#60] The pretended fisherman's name Karim=the Generous.[FN#61] Such an act of generosity would appear to Europeans well-nigh insanity, but it is quite in Arab manners. Witness the oft-quoted tale of Hatim and his horse. As a rule the Arab is thereverse of generous, contrasting badly, in this point, with hiscousin the Jew: hence his ideal of generosity is of the veryhighest. "The generous (i.e. liberal) is Allah's friend, aye,though he be a sinner; and the miser is Allah's foe, aye, thoughhe be a saint!" Indian Moslems call a skin-flint Makhi-chus =fly-sucker. (Pilgrimage i. 242.)[FN#62] Arab. "Amma ba'ad" or (Wa ba'ad), an initiatory formulaattributed to Koss ibn Sa'idat al-Iyadi, bishop of Najran (thetown in Al-Yaman which D'Herbelot calls Negiran) and a famouspreacher in Mohammed's day, hence "more eloquent than Koss"(Maydani, Arab. Prov., 189). He was the first who addressedletters with the incept, "from A. to B."; and the first whopreached from a pulpit and who leant on a sword or a staff whendiscoursing. Many Moslems date Amma ba'ad from the Prophet David,relying upon a passage of the Koran (xxxviii. 19).[FN#63] Arab. "Nusf"=half (a dirham): vulgarly pronounced "nuss,"and synonymous with the Egypt. "Faddah" (=silver), the Greek"Asper," and the Turkish "parah." It is the smallest Egyptiancoin, made of very base metal and, there being forty to thepiastre, it is worth nearly a quarter of a farthing.[FN#64] The too literal Torrens and Lane make the Caliph give thegardener-lad the clothes in which he was then clad, forgetting,like the author or copier, that he wore the fisherman's lousysuit.[FN#65] In sign of confusion, disappointment and so forth: not"biting his nails," which is European and utterly un-Asiatic.[FN#66] See lines like these in Night xiii. (i. 136); thesentiment is trite.[FN#67] The Arab will still stand under his ruler's palace andshout aloud to attract his attention. Sayyid Sa'id known as the"Iman of Muskat" used to encourage the patriarchal practice.Mohammed repeatedly protested against such unceremonious conduct(Koran xciv. 11, etc.). The "three times of privacy" (Koran cv.57) are before the dawn prayer, during the Siesta (noon) andafter the even-prayer.[FN#68] The Judges of the four orthodox schools.[FN#69] That none might see it or find it ever after.[FN#70] Arab. "Khatt Sharif"=a royal autographical letter: theterm is still preserved in Turkey, but Europeans will write"Hatt."[FN#71] Meaning "Little tom-cat;" a dim. of "Kitt" vulg. Kutt orGutt.[FN#72] Arab. "Matmurah" -the Algerine "Matamor" -a "silo," madefamiliar to England by the invention of "Ensilage."[FN#73] The older "Mustapha"=Mohammed. This Intercession-doctrineis fiercely disputed. (Pilgrimage ii. 77.) The Apostle of Al-Islam seems to have been unable to make up his mind upon thesubject: and modern opinion amongst Moslems is apparentlyborrowed from the Christians.[FN#74] Lane (i. 486) curiously says, "The place of thestagnation of blood:" yet he had translated the word aright inthe Introduction (i. 41). I have noticed that the Nat'a is madelike the "Sufrah," of well-tanned leather, with rings in theperiphery, so that a thong passed through turns it into a bag.The Sufrah used for provisions is usually yellow, with a blackborder and small pouches for knives or spoons. (Pilgrimage i.111.)[FN#75] This improbable detail shows the Caliph's greatness.[FN#76] "Cousin" is here a term of familiarity, our "coz."[FN#77] i.e. without allowing them a moment's delay to changeclothes.[FN#78] i.e. according to my nature, birth, blood, de race.[FN#79] Our "Job." The English translators of the Bible, whoborrowed Luther's system of transliteration (of A.D. 1522),transferred into English the German "j" which has the sound of"i" or "y"; intending us to pronounce Yacob (or Yakob), Yericho,Yimnites, Yob (or Hiob) and Yudah. Tyndall, who copied Luther(A.D. 1525-26), preserved the true sound by writing lacob, BenIamin and Iudas. But his successors unfortunately returned to theGerman; the initial I, having from the xiii century beenornamentally lengthened and bent leftwards, became a consonant.The public adopted the vernacular sound of "j" (da) and hence ourlanguage and our literature are disgraced by such barbarisms as"Jehovah" and "Jesus"; Dgehovah and Dgeesus for Yehovah andYesus. Future generations of school-teachers may remedy the evil;meanwhile we are doomed for the rest of our days to hear   Gee-rusalem! Gee-rusalem! etc.Nor is there one word to be said in favour of the corruptionexcept that, like the Protestant mispronunciation of Latin andthe Erasmian ill-articulation of Greek, it has become English,and has lent its little aid in dividing the Britons from the restof the civilised world.[FN#80] The moon, I repeat, is masculine in the so-called"Semitic" tongues.[FN#81] i.e. camel loads, about lbs. 300; and for long journeyslbs. 250.[FN#82] Arab. "Janazah," so called only when carrying a corpse;else Na'ash, Sarir or Tabut: Iran being the large hearse on whichchiefs are borne. It is made of plank or stick work; but thereare several varieties. (Lane, M. E. chaps. xxviii.)[FN#83] It is meritorious to accompany the funeral cortege of aMoslem even for a few paces.[FN#84] Otherwise he could not have joined in the prayers.[FN#85] Arab. "Halwa" made of sugar, cream, almonds, etc. That ofMaskat is famous throughout the East.[FN#86] i.e. "Camphor" to a negro, as we say "Snowball," by thefigure antiphrase.[FN#87] "Little Good Luck," a dim. form of "bakht"=luck, aPersian word naturalized in Egypt.[FN#88] There are, as I have shown, not a few cannibal tribes inCentral Africa and these at times find their way into the slavemarket.[FN#89] i.e. After we bar the door.[FN#90] Arab. "Jawish" from Turk. Chawush, Chiaoosh, a sergeant,poursuivant, royal messenger. I would suggest that this is theword "Shalish" or "Jalish" in Al-Siynti's History of the Caliphs(p. 501) translated by Carlyle "milites," by Schultens"Sagittarius" and by Jarett "picked troops."[FN#91] This familiarity with blackamoor slave-boys is common inEgypt and often ends as in the story: Egyptian blood issufficiently mixed with negro to breed inclination formiscegenation. But here the girl was wickedly neglected by hermother at such an age as ten.[FN#92] Arab. "Farj"; hence a facetious designation of the othersex is "Zawi'l-furuj" (grammatically Zawatu'l- furuj)=habentesrimam, slit ones.[FN#93] This ancient and venerable practice of inspecting themarriage-sheet is still religiously preserved in most parts ofthe East, and in old-fashioned Moslem families. It is publiclyexposed in the Harem to prove that the "domestic calamity" (thedaughter) went to her husband a clean maid. Also the general ideais that no blood will impose upon the exerts, or jury of matrons,except that of a pigeon-poult which exactly resembles hymenealblood-- when not subjected to the microscope. This belief isuniversal in Southern Europe and I have heard of it in England.Further details will be given in Night ccxi.[FN#94] "Agha" Turk.=sir, gentleman, is, I have said, politelyaddressed to a eunuch.[FN#95] As Bukhayt tells us he lost only his testes, consequentlyhis erectio et distensio penis was as that of a boy beforepuberty and it would last as long as his heart and circulationkept sound. Hence the eunuch who preserves his penis is muchprized in the Zenanah where some women prefer him to the entireman, on account of his long performance of the deed of kind. Ofthis more in a future page.[FN#96] It is or rather was the custom in Egypt and Syria torange long rows of fine China bowls along the shelves runninground the rooms at the height of six or seven feet, and theyformed a magnificent cornice. I bought many of them at Damascustill the people, learning their value, asked prohibitive prices.[FN#97] The tale is interesting as well as amusing, excellentlydescribing the extravagance still practiced in middle-classMoslem families on the death of the pater familias. I must againnote that Arab women are much more unwilling to expose the backof the head covered by the "Tarhah" (head-veil) than the face,which is hidden by the "Burke" or nose bag.[FN#98] The usual hysterical laughter of this nervous race.[FN#99] Here the slave refuses to be set free and starve. For amaster so to do without ample reasons is held disgraceful. I wellremember the weeping and wailing throughout Sind when an orderfrom Sir Charles Napier set free the negroes whom Britishphilanthropy thus doomed to endure if not to die of hunger.[FN#100] Manumission, which is founded upon Roman law, is anextensive subject discussed in the Hidayah and other canonicalworks. The slave here lays down the law incorrectly but his claimshows his truly "nigger" impudence.[FN#101] This is quite true to nature. The most remarkable thingin the wild central African is his enormous development of"destructiveness." At Zanzibar I never saw a slave break a glassor plate without a grin or a chuckle of satisfaction.[FN#102] Arab. "Khassa-ni"; Khusyatani (vulg.) being thetesticles, also called "bayzatan" the two eggs) a double entendrewhich has given rise to many tales. For instance in the wittyPersian book "Dozd o Kazi" (The Thief and the Judge) a footpadstrips the man of learning and offers to return his clothes if hecan ask him a puzzle in law or religion. The Kazi (in folk-loremostly a fool) fails, and his wife bids him ask the man to supperfor a trial of wits on the same condition. She begins withcompliments and ends by producing five eggs which she would havehim distribute equally amongst the three; and, when he isperplexed, she gives one to each of the men taking three forherself. Whereupon the "Dozd" wends his way, having lost hisbooty as his extreme stupidity deserved. In the text the eunuch,Kafur, is made a "Sandal" or smooth-shaven, so that he was of nouse to women.[FN#103] Arab. "Khara," the lowest possible word: Ya Khara! isthe commonest of insults, used also by modest women. I have heardone say it to her son.[FN#104] Arab. "Kamah," a measure of length, a fathom, alsocalled "Ba'a." Both are omitted in that sadly superficial book,Lane's Modern Egyptians, App. B.[FN#105] Names of her slave-girls which mean (in order),Garden-bloom, Dawn (or Beautiful), Tree o' Pearl (P. N. ofSaladin's wife), Light of (right) Direction, Star o' the MornLewdness (= Shahwah, I suppose this is a chaff), Delight,Sweetmeat and Miss Pretty.[FN#106] This mode of disposing of a rival was very common inHarems. But it had its difficulties and on the whole the riverwas (and is) preferred.[FN#107] An Eastern dislikes nothing more than drinking in a dimdingy place: the brightest lights seem to add to his"drinkitite."[FN#108] He did not sleep with her because he suspected somepalace-mystery which suggested prudence, she also had herreasons.[FN#109] This as called in Egypt "Allah." (Lane M. E. chaps. i.)[FN#110] It would be a broad ribbon-like band upon which theletters could be worked.[FN#111] In the Arab. "he cried." These "Yes, Yes!" and "No! No!"trifles are very common amongst the Arabs.[FN#112] Arab. "Maragha" lit. rubbed his face on them like afawning dog. Ghanim is another "softy" lover, a favouritecharacter in Arab tales; and by way of contrast, the girl ismasterful enough.[FN#113] Because the Abbaside Caliphs descend from Al-Abbas,paternal uncle of Mohammed, text means more explicitly, "Odescendant of the Prophet's uncle!"[FN#114] The most terrible part of a belle passion in the East isthat the beloved will not allow her lover leave of absence for anhour.[FN#115] It is hard to preserve these wretched puns. In theoriginal we have "O spray (or branch) of capparis-shrub (araki)which has been thinned of leaf and fruit (tujna, i.e., whosefruit, the hymen, has been plucked before and not by me) I seethee (araka) against me sinning (tajni).[FN#116] Apparently the writer forgets that the Abbaside bannersand dress were black, originally a badge of mourning for the ImamIbrahim bin Mohammed put to death by the Ommiade CaliphAl-Marwan. The modern Egyptian mourning, like the old Persian, isindigo-blue of the darkest; but, as before noted, the custom isby no means universal.[FN#117] Koran, chaps. iv. In the East as elsewhere the Devilquotes Scripture.[FN#118] A servant returning from a journey shows his master duehonour by appearing before him in travelling suit and uncleaned.[FN#119] The first name means "Rattan", the second "Willow wand,"from the "Ban" or "Khilaf" the Egyptian willow (Salix AegyptiacaLinn.) vulgarly called "Safsaf." Forskal holds the "Ban" to be adifferent variety.[FN#120] Arab. "Ta'am," which has many meanings: in mod. parlanceit would signify millet holcus seed.[FN#121] i.e. "I well know how to deal with him."[FN#122] The Pen (title of the Koranic chaps. Ixviii.) and thePreserved Tablet (before explained).[FN#123] These plunderings were sanctioned by custom. But a fewyears ago, when the Turkish soldiers mutinied about arrears ofpay (often delayed for years) the governing Pasha would set fireto the town and allow the men to loot what they pleased during astated time. Rochet (soi-disant D'Hericourt) amusingly describesthis manoeuvre of the Turkish Governor of Al-Hodaydah in the lastgeneration. (Pilgrimage iii. 381.)[FN#124] Another cenotaph whose use was to enable women toindulge in their pet pastime of weeping and wailing in company.[FN#125] The lodging of pauper travellers, as the chapel inIceland is of the wealthy. I have often taken benefit of themosque, but as a rule it is unpleasant, the matting being notonly torn but over-populous. Juvenal seems to allude to theJewish Synagogue similarly used: "in qua te quaero proseucha"?(iii. 296) and in Acts iii. we find the lame, blind and impotentin the Temple-porch.[FN#126] This foul sort of vermin is supposed to be bred byperspiration. It is an epoch in the civilised traveller's lifewhen he catches his first louse.[FN#127] The Moslem peasant is a kind hearted man and will makemany sacrifices for a sick stranger even of another creed. It isa manner of "pundonor" with the village.[FN#128] Such treatment of innocent women was only too commonunder the Caliphate and in contemporary Europe.[FN#129] This may also mean, "And Heaven will reward thee," butcamel-men do not usually accept any drafts upon futurity.[FN#130] He felt that he was being treated like a corpse.[FN#131] This hatred of the Hospital extends throughout SouthernEurope, even in places where it is not justified.[FN#132] The importance of the pillow (wisadah or makhaddah) tothe sick man is often recognised in The Nights. "He took to hispillow" is = took to his bed.[FN#133] i.e in order that the reverend men, who do not rendersuch suit and service gratis, might pray for him.[FN#134] The reader will notice in The Nights the frequentmention of these physical prognostications, with which mesmeristsare familiar.[FN#135] The Pers. name of the planet Saturn in the SeventhHeaven. Arab. "Zuhal"; the Kiun or Chiun of Amos vi. 26.[FN#136] i.e. "Pardon me if I injured thee"-- a popular phrase.[FN#137] A "seduction," a charmer. The double-entendre has beforebeen noticed.[FN#138] This knightly tale, the longest in the Nights (xliv.--cxlv.), about one-eighth of the whole, does not appear in theBres. Edit. Lane, who finds it "objectionable," reduces it to twoof its episodes, Aziz-cum-Azizah and Taj al-Muluk. On the otherhand it has been converted into a volume (8vo, pp. 240)"Scharkan, Conte Arabe," etc. Traduit par M. Asselan Riche, etc.Paris: Dondey-Dupre. 1829. It has its longueurs and at times islongsome enough; but it is interesting as a comparison betweenthe chivalry of Al-Islam and European knight-errantry. Althoughall the characters are fictitious the period is evidently in theearly crusading days. Caesarea, the second capital of Palestine,taken during the Caliphate of Omar (A.H. 19) and afterwardsrecovered, was fortified in A.H. 353 = 963 as a base against theArabs by the Emperor Phocas, the Arab. "Nakfur" i.e. Nicephorus.In A.H. 498=1104, crusading craft did much injury by plunderingmerchantmen between Egypt and Syria, to which allusion is foundin the romance. But the story teller has not quite made up hismind about which Caesarea he is talking, and M. Riche tells usthat Cesaree is a "ville de la Mauritanie, en Afrique" (p. 20).[FN#139] The fifth Ommiade Caliph reign. A.H. 65-86 = 685-704.[FN#140] This does not merely mean that no one was safe from hiswrath: or, could approach him in the heat of fight: it is areminiscence of the masterful "King Kulayb," who establishedgame-laws in his dominions and would allow no man to approach hiscamp-fire. Moreover the Jinn lights a fire to decoy travellers,but if his victim be bold enough to brave him, he invites him totake advantage of the heat.[FN#141] China.[FN#142] The Jaxartes and the Bactrus (names very looselyapplied).[FN#143] In full "Sharrun kana" i.e. an evil (Sharr) has come tobeing (kana) that is, "bane to the foe" a pagan and knightlyname. The hero of the Romance "Al-Dalhamah" is described as abitter gourd (colocynth), a viper, a calamity.[FN#144] This is a Moslem law (Koran chaps. iv. bodily borrowedfrom the Talmud) which does not allow a man to marry one wifeunless he can carnally satisfy her. Moreover he must distribute hishonours equally and each wife has a right to her night unless sheherself give it up. This was the case even with the spouses of theProphet; and his biography notices several occasions when his wiveswaived their rights in favour of one another M. Riche kindlyprovides the King with la piquante francaise (p. 15).[FN#145] So the celebrated mosque in Stambul, famed for being thelargest church in the world is known to the Greeks as "Agia (pron.Aya) Sophia" and to Moslems as "Aye Sofiyeh" (Holy Wisdom) i.e. theLogos or Second Person of the Trinity (not a Saintess). The sendinga Christian girl as a present to a Moslem would, in these days, beconsidered highly scandalous. But it was done by the Mukaukis orCoptic Governor of Egypt (under Heraclius) who of course hated theGreeks. This worthy gave two damsels to Mohammed; one called Sirinand the other Mariyah (Maria) whom the Prophet reserved for hisespecial use and whose abode is still shown at Al-Medinah. The Rev.Doctor Badger (loc. cit. p. 972) gives the translation of anepistle by Mohammed to this Mukaukis, written in the Cuficcharacter ( ? ?) and sealed "Mohammed, The Apostle of Allah." Myfriend seems to believe that it is an original, but upon thissubject opinions will differ. It is, however, exceedinglyinteresting, beginning with "Bismillah," etc., and ending (beforethe signature) with a quotation from the Koran (iii. 57); and itmay be assumed as a formula addressee to foreign potentates by aProphet who had become virtually "King of Arabia."[FN#146] This prayer before "doing the deed of kind" is, I havesaid, Moslem as well Christian.[FN#147] Exodus i. 16, quoted by Lane (M. E., chaps. xxvii.).Torrens in his Notes cites Drayton's "Moon-calf':--    Bring forth the birth-stool--no, let it alone;    She is so far beyond all compass grown,    Some other new device us needs must stead,    Or else she never can be brought to bed.It is the "groaning-chair" of Poor Robin's Almanac (1676) and wefind it alluded to in Boccaccio, the classical sedile whichaccording to scoffers has formed the papal chair (a curule seat)ever since the days of Pope Joan, when it has been held advisablefor one of the Cardinals to ascertain that His Holiness possessesall the instruments of virility. This "Kursi al-wiladah" is ofpeculiar form on which the patient is seated. A most interestingessay might be written upon the various positions preferred duringdelivery, e.g. the wild Irish still stand on all fours, like theso-called "lower animals." Amongst the Moslems of Waday, etc., acord is hung from the top of the hut, and the woman in labour holdson to it standing with her legs apart, till the midwife receivesthe child.[FN#148] Some Orientalists call "lullilooing" the trilling cry,which is made by raising the voice to its highest pitch andbreaking it by a rapid succession of touches on the palate with thetongue-tip, others "Ziraleet" and Zagaleet, and one traveller tellsus that it began at the marriage-festival of Isaac and Rebecca (!).Arabs term it classically "Tahlil" and vulgarly "Zaghrutah" (Plur.Zagharit) and Persians "Kil." Finally in Don Quixote we have"Lelilies," the battle-cry of the Moors (Duffield iii. 289). Dr.Buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds, but the goodmissionary heard it at the festival of Jagannath. (Pilgrimage iii.197 )[FN#149] i.e. "Light of the Place" (or kingdom) and "Delight of theAge."[FN#150] It is utterly absurd to give the old heroic Persian nameAfridun or Furaydun, the destroyer of Zohak or Zahhak to a Greek,but such anachronisms are characteristic of The Nights and areevidently introduced on purpose. See Boccaccio, ix. 9.[FN#151] Arab. "Yunan" lit. Ionia, which applies to all Greece,insular and continental, especially to ancient Greece.[FN#152] In 1870 I saw at Sidon a find of some hundreds of gold"Philippi" and "Alexanders."[FN#153] M. Riche has (p. 21), "Ces talismans travailles par leciseau du celebre Califaziri," adding in a note, "Je pense quec'est un sculpteur Arabe."[FN#154] This periphrase, containing what seems to us a uselessnegative, adds emphasis in Arabic.[FN#155] This bit of geographical information is not in the BullEdit.[FN#156] In Pers. = a tooth, the popular word.[FN#157] This preliminary move, called in Persian Nakl-i Safar, isgenerally mentioned. So the Franciscan monks in California, whensetting out for a long journey through the desert, marched threetimes round the convent and pitched tents for the night under itswalls.[FN#158] In Arab. "Khazinah" or "Khaznah" lit. a treasure,representing 1,000 "Kis" or purses (each=Pound Sterling5). The sumin the text is 7,000 purses X 5=Pound Sterling35,000.[FN#159] Travellers often prefer such sites because they aresheltered from the wind, and the ground is soft for pitching tents;but many have come to grief from sudden torrents following rain.[FN#160] Arab "Ghabah" not a forest in our sense of the word, buta place where water sinks and the trees (mostly Mimosas), whichelsewhere are widely scattered, form a comparatively dense growthand collect in thickets. These are favourite places for wild beastsduring noon-heats.[FN#161] At various times in the East Jews and Christians wereordered to wear characteristic garments, especially the Zunnar orgirdle.[FN#162] The description is borrowed from the Coptic Convent, whichinvariably has an inner donjon or keep. The oldest monastery in theworld is Mar Antonios (St. Anthony the Hermit) not far from Suez.(Gold Mines of Midian, p. 85.)[FN#163] "Dawahi," plur. of Dahiyah = a mishap. The title means"Mistress of Misfortunes" or Queen of Calamities (to the enemy);and the venerable lady, as will be seen, amply deserved her name,which is pronounced Zat al-Dawahi.[FN#164] Arab. "Kunfuz"=hedgehog or porcupine.[FN#165] These flowers of speech are mere familiarities, notinsults. In societies where the sexes are separated speech becomesexceedingly free. "Etourdie que vous etes," says M. Riche, toningdown the text.[FN#166] Arab. "Zirt," a low word. The superlative "Zarrat"(fartermost) or, "Abu Zirt" (Father of farts) is a facetious termamong the bean-eating Fellahs and a deadly insult amongst theBadawin (Night ccccx.). The latter prefer the word Taggaa(Pilgrimage iii. 84). We did not disdain the word infarthingale=pet en air.[FN#167] Arab. "kicked" him, i.e. with the sharp corner of theshovel-stirrup. I avoid such expressions as "spurring" and"pricking over the plain," because apt to give a wrong idea.[FN#168] Arab. "Allaho Akbar!" the classical Moslem slogan.[FN#169] Arab horses are never taught to leap, so she was quitesafe on the other side of a brook nine feet broad.[FN#170] "Batrik" (vulg. Bitrik)=patricius, a title given toChristian knights who commanded ten thousand men; the Tarkhan (orNobb) heading four thousand, and the Kaumas (Arab. Kaid) twohundred. It must not be confounded with Batrak (orBatrik)=patriarcha. (Lane's Lex.)[FN#171] Arab. "Kazi al-Kuzat," a kind of Chief Justice orChancellor. The office wag established under the rule of Harun alRashid, who so entitled Abu Yusuf Ya'akab al-Ansari: therefore theallusion is anachronistic. The same Caliph also caused the Olema todress as they do still.[FN#172] The allusion is Koranic: "O men, if ye be in doubtconcerning the resurrection, consider that He first created you ofthe dust of the ground (Adam), afterwards of seed" (chaps. xxii.).But the physiological ideas of the Koran are curious. It supposesthat the Mani or male semen is in the loins and that of women inthe breast bone (chaps Ixxxvi.); that the mingled seed of the two(chaps. Ixxvi.) fructifies the ovary and that the child is fedthrough the navel with menstruous blood, hence the cessation of thecatamenia. Barzoi (Kalilah and Dimnah) says:-- "Man's seed, fallinginto the woman's womb, is mixed with her seed and her blood: whenit thickens and curdles the Spirit moves it and it turns about likeliquid cheese; then it solidifies, its arteries are formed, itslimbs constructed and its joints distinguished. If the babe is amale, his face is placed towards his mother's back; if a female,towards her belly." (P. 262, Mr. L G.N. Keith- Falconer'stranslation.) But there is a curious prolepsis of thespermatozoa-theory. We read (Koran chaps. vii.), "Thy Lord drewforth their posterity from the loins of the sons of Adam;" and thecommentators say that Allah stroked Adam's back and extracted fromhis loins all his posterity, which shall ever be, in the shape ofsmall ants; these confessed their dependence on God and weredismissed to return whence they came." From this fiction it appears(says Sale) that the doctrine of pre-existence is not unknown tothe Mohammedans, and there is some little conformity between it andthe modern theory of generatio ex animalculis in semine marium. Thepoets call this Yaum-i-Alast = the Day of Am-I-not (-your Lord)?which Sir William Jones most unhappily translated "Art thou notwith thy Lord ?" (Alasta bi Rabbi- kum); fand they produce a grandvision of unembodied spirits appearing in countless millions beforetheir Creator.[FN#173] The usual preliminary of a wrestling bout.[FN#174] In Eastern wrestling this counts as a fair fail. So Ajaxfell on his back with Ulysses on his breast. (Iliad xxxii., 700,etc.)[FN#175] So biting was allowed amongst the Greeks in the {Greekletters} he final struggle on the ground.[FN#176] Supposed to be names of noted wrestlers. "Kayim" (notEl-Kim as Torrens has it) is a term now applied to a juggler or"professor" of legerdemain who amuses people in the streets witheasy tricks. (Lane, M. E., chaps. xx.)[FN#177] Lit. "laughed in his face" which has not the unpleasantmeaning it bears in English.[FN#178] Arab. "Abu riyah"=a kind of child's toy. It is our"bull-roarer" well known in Australia and parts of Africa.[FN#179] The people of the region south of the Caspian which iscalled "Sea of Daylam." It has a long history; for which seeD'Herbelot, s.v. "Dilem."[FN#180] Coptic convents in Egypt still affect these drawbridgesover the keep-moat.[FN#181] Koran iv., xxii. etc., meaning it is lawful to marry womentaken in war after the necessary purification although theirhusbands be still living. This is not permitted with a free womanwho is a True Believer. I have noted that the only concubineslave-girl mentioned in the Koran are these "captives possessed bythe right hand."[FN#182] The Amazonian dame is a favourite in folk-lore and is anornament to poetry from the Iliad to our modern day. Such heroines,apparently unknown to the Pagan Arabs, were common in the earlyages of Al-Islam as Ockley and Gibbon prove, and that the race isnot extinct may be seen in my Pilgrimage (iii. 55) where the sisterof Ibn Rumi resolved to take blood revenge for her brother.[FN#183] And Solomon said, "O nobles, which of you will bring meher throne ?" A terrible genius (i.e. an If rit of the Jinn namedDhakwan or the notorious Sakhr) said, " I will bring it unto theebefore thou arise from thy seat (of justice); for I am able toperform it, and may be trusted" (Koran, xxvii. 38-39). Balkis orBilkis (says the Durrat al-Ghawwas) daughter of Hozad binSharhabil, twenty-second in the list of the rulers of Al- Yaman,according to some murdered her husband, and became, by Moslemignorance, the Biblical " Queen of Sheba." The Abyssinians transferher from Arabian Saba to Ethiopia and make her the mother bySolomon of Menelek, their proto-monarch; thus claiming for theirroyalties an antiquity compared with which all reigning houses inthe world are of yesterday. The dates of the Tababi'ah or Tobbasprove that the Bilkis of history ruled Al-Yaman in the earlyChristian era.[FN#184] Arab. "Fass," fiss or fuss; the gem set in a ring; alsoapplied to a hillock rounded en cabochon. In The Nights it is usedto signify "a fine gem."[FN#185] This prominence of the glutaei muscles is always insistedupon, because it is supposed to promise well in a bed-fellow. InSomali land where the people are sub-steatopygous, a rich youngman, who can afford such luxury, will have the girls drawn up inline and choose her to wife who projects furthest behind[FN#186] The "bull" is only half mine.[FN#187] A favourite Arab phrase, the "hot eye" is one full oftears.[FN#188] i.e., "Coral," coral branch, a favourite name for aslave-girl, especially a negress. It is the older "Morgiana." I donot see why Preston in Al-Harini's "Makamah (Seance) of Singar"renders it pearls, because Golius gives "small pearls," when it isevidently "coral." Richardson (Dissert. xlviii.) seems to mejustified in finding the Pari (fairy) Marjan of heroic Persianhistory reflected in the Fairy Morgain who earned off King Arthurafter the battle of Camelon.[FN#189] Arab. "'Ud Jalaki"=Jalak or Jalik being a poetical andalmost obsolete name of Damascus.[FN#190] The fountain in Paradise whose water shall be drunk with"pure" wine mixed and sealed with musk (for clay). It is so calledbecause it comes from the "Sanam" (Sanima, to be high) boss orhighest ridge of the Moslem Heaven (Koran lv. 78 and lxxxiii. 27).Mr. Rodwell says "it is conveyed to the highest apartments in thePavilions of Paradise." (?)[FN#191] This "hysterical" temperament is not rare even amongst thebravest Arabs.[FN#192] An idea evidently derived from the Aeolipyla (ollaanimatoria) the invention of Hero Alexandrinus, which showed thatthe ancient Egyptians could apply the motive force of steam.[FN#193] Kuthayyir ibn Abi Jumah, a poet and far-famed Rawi orTale-reciter, mentioned by Ibn Khallikan he lived at Al-Medinah andsang the attractions of one Azzah, hence his soubriquet Sahib(lover of) Azzah. As he died in A. H. 105 (=726), his presence hereis a gross anachronism the imaginary Sharrkan flourished before theCaliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marwan A. H. 65-86.[FN#194] Jamil bin Ma'amar, a poet and lover contemporary withAl-Kuthayrir.[FN#195] Arab. "Tafazzal," a word of frequent use inconversation="favour me," etc.[FN#196] The word has a long history. From the Gr.    ææ  or      is the Lat. stibium; while the Low Latin "antimonium" and the Span.Althimod are by metathesis for Al-Ithmid. The dictionaries definethe substance as a stone from which antimony is prepared, but theArabs understand a semi-mythical mineral of yellow colour whichenters into the veins of the eyes and gives them Iynx-like vision.The famous Anz nicknamed Zarka (the blue eyed) of Yamamah(Province) used it; and, according to some, invented Kohl. When her(protohistoric) tribe Jadis had destroyed all the rival race ofTasm, except Ribah ibn Murrah; the sole survivor fled to the Tobbaof Al-Yaman, who sent a host to avenge him. The king commanded hisHimyarites to cut tree-boughs and use them as screens (again Birnamwood). Zarka from her Utum, or peel-tower, saw the army threemarches off and cried, "O folk, either trees or Himyar are comingupon you!" adding, in Rajaz verse:--I swear by Allah that trees creep onward, or that Himyar bearethsomewhat which he draweth along!She then saw a man mending his sandal. But Jadis disbelieved;Cassandra was slain and, when her eyes were cut out the vesselswere found full of Ithmid. Hence Al-Mutanabbi sang:           "Sharper-sighted than Zarka of Jau" (Yamamah).See C. de Perceval i. 101; Arab. Prov. i. 192; and Chenery p. 381.(The Assemblies of Al-Hariri; London, Williams and Norgate, 1867).I have made many enquiries into the true nature of Ithmid andfailed to learn anything: on the Upper Nile the word is=Kohl.[FN#197] The general colour of chessmen in the East, where the gameis played on a cloth more often than a board.[FN#198] Arab. "Al-fil," the elephant=the French fol or fou and ourbishop. I have derived "elephant" from Pil (old Persian, Sansk.Pilu) and Arab. Fil, with the article Al-Fil, whence the Greek{Greek letters} the suffix--as being devoted to barbarous words asObod-as (Al Ubayd), Aretas (Al-Haris), etc. Mr. Isaac Taylor (TheAlphabet i. 169), preserves the old absurdity of "eleph-ant orox-like (!) beast of Africa." Prof. Sayce finds the word al-ab (twodistinct characters) in line 3, above the figure of an (Indian)elephant, on the black obelisk of Nimrod Mound, and suggests anAssyrian derivation.[FN#199] Arab. "Shaukat" which may also mean the "pride" or"mainstay" (of the army).[FN#200] Lit. "smote him on the tendons of his neck." This is thefamous shoulder-cut (Tawash shuh) which, with the leg-cut (Kalam),formed, and still forms, the staple of Eastern attack with thesword.[FN#201] Arab. "Diras." Easterns do not thresh with flails. Thematerial is strewed over a round and smoothed floor of dried mud inthe open air and threshed by different connivances. In Egypt thefavourite is a chair-like machine called "Norag," running on ironplates and drawn by bulls or cows over the corn. Generally,however, Moslems prefer the old classical {Greek letters}, theTribulum of Virgil and Varro, a slipper-shaped sled of woodgarnished on the sole with large-headed iron nails, or sharpfragments of flint or basalt. Thus is made the "Tibn" or straw, theuniversal hay of the East, which our machines cannot imitate.[FN#202] These numbers appear to be grossly exaggerated, but theywere possible in the days of sword and armour: at the battle ofSaffayn the Caliph Ali is said to have cut down five hundred andtwenty-three men in a single night.[FN#203] Arab. "Bika'a": hence the "Buka'ah" or Coelesyria.[FN#204] Richardson in his excellent dictionary (note 103) whichmodern priggism finds "unscientific " wonderfully derives this wordfrom Arab. "Khattaf," a snatcher (i.e. of women), a ravisher. It isan evident corruption of "captivus" through Italian and French[FN#205] These periodical and fair-like visitations to convents arestill customary; especially amongst the Christians of Damascus. [FN#206] Camphor being then unknown.[FN#207] The "wrecker" is known all over the world; and not onlybarbarians hold that ships driven ashore become the property of theshore[FN#208] Arab. "Jokh": it is not a dictionary word, but the onlyterm in popular use for European broadcloth.[FN#209] The second person plural is used because the writer wouldinvolve the subjects of his correspondent in the matter.[FN#210] This part of the phrase, which may seem unnecessary to theEuropean, is perfectly intelligible to all Orientalists. You mayread many an Eastern letter and not understand it. Compare Boccacooiv. 1.[FN#211] i.e. he was greatly agitated[FN#212] In text "Li-ajal a al-Taudi'a," for the purpose offarewelling, a low Egyptianism; emphatically a "Kalam wati."(Pilgrimage thee iii. 330.)[FN#213] In the Mac. Edit. Sharrkan speaks, a clerical error.[FN#214] The Farsakh (Germ. Stunde) a measure of time rather thandistance, is an hour's travel or its equivalent, a league, ameile=three English stat. miles. The word is still used in Persiaits true home, but not elsewhere. It is very old, having beendetermined as a lineal measure of distance by Herodotus (ii. 5 and6 ; v. 53), who computes it at 30 furlongs (=furrow-lengths, 8 tothe stat. mile). Strabo (xi.) makes it range from 40 to 60 stades(each=606 feet 9 inches), and even now it varies between 1,500 to6,000 yards. Captain Francklin (Tour to Persia) estimates it =about four miles. (Pilgrimage ii. 113.)[FN#215] Arab. "Ashhab." Names of colours are few amongst semicivilised peoples, but in Arabia there is a distinct word for everyshade of horseflesh.[FN#216] She had already said to him "Thou art beaten ineverything!"[FN#217] Showing that she was still a Christian.[FN#218] This is not Badawi sentiment: the honoratioren amongstwild people would scorn such foul play; but amongst the settledArabs honour between men and women is unknown and such "hocussing"would be held quite fair.[FN#219] The table of wine, in our day, is mostly a japanned traywith glasses and bottles, saucers of pickles and fruits and,perhaps, a bunch of flowers and aromatic herbs. During theCaliphate the "wine-service" was on a larger scale.[FN#220] Here the "Bhang" (almost a generic term applied tohellebore, etc.) may be hyoscyamus or henbane. Yet there arevarieties of Cannabis, such as the Dakha of South Africa capable ofmost violent effect. I found the use of the drug well known to thenegroes of the Southern United States and of the Brazil, althoughfew of their owners had ever heard of it.[FN#221] Amongst Moslems this is a reference to Adam who first"sinned against himself,' and who therefore is called "Safiyu'llah," the Pure of Allah. (Pilgrimage iii. 333.)[FN#222] Meaning, an angry, violent man.[FN#223] Arab. "Inshad," which may mean reciting the verse ofanother or improvising one's own. In Modern Egypt "Munshid" is thesinger or reciter of poetry at Zikrs (Lane M. E. chaps. xxiv.).Here the verses are quite bad enough to be improvised by thehapless Princess.[FN#224] The negro skin assumes this dust colour in cold, fear,concupiscence and other mental emotions.[FN#225] He compares her glance with the blade of a Yamani sword,a lieu commun of Eastern poetry. The weapons are famous in TheNights; but the best sword-cutlery came from Persia as theporcelain from China to Sana'a. Here, however, is especial allusionas to the sword "Samsam" or "Samsamah." It belonged to theHimyarite Tobba, Amru bin Ma'ad Kurb, and came into the hands ofHarun al-Rashid. When the Emperor of the Greeks sent a present ofsuperior sword-blades to him by way of a brave, the Caliph, in thepresence of the Envoys, took "Samsam" in hand and cut the others intwain as if they were cabbages without the least prejudice to theedge of "Samsam."[FN#226] This touch of pathos is truly Arab. So in the "Romance ofDalhamah" (Lane, M. E. xxiii.) the infant Gundubah sucks the breastof its dead mother and the King exclaims, "If she had committedthis crime she would not be affording the child her milk after shewas dead."[FN#227] Arab. "Sadda'l-Aktar," a term picturesque enough to bepreserved in English. "Sadd," I have said, is a wall or dyke, theterm applied to the great dam of water- plants which obstructs thenavigation of the Upper Nile, the lilies and other growths floatingwith the current from the (Victoria) Nyanza Lake. I may note thatwe need no longer derive from India the lotus-llily so extensivelyused by the Ancient Egyptians and so neglected by the moderns thatit has well nigh disappeared. All the Central African basins aboundin the Nymphaea and thence it found its way down the Nile Valley.[FN#228] Arab. "Al Marhumah": equivalent to our "late lamented." [FN#229] Vulgarly pronounced "Mahmal," and by Egyptians and Turks"Mehmel." Lane (M. E. xxiv.) has figured this queenly litter and Ihave sketched and described it in my Pilgrimage (iii. 12).[FN#230] For such fits of religious enthusiasm see my Pilgrimage(iii. 254).[FN#231] "Irak" (Mesopotamia) means "a level country beside thebanks of a ever."[FN#232] "Al Kuds," or "Bays al-Mukaddas," is still the popularname of Jerusalem, from the Heb. Yerushalaim ha-Kadushah (legend onshekel of Simon Maccabeus).[FN#233] "Follow the religion of Abraham" says the Koran (chaps.iii. 89). Abraham, titled "Khalilu'llah," ranks next in dignity toMohammed, preceding Isa, I need hardly say that his tomb is not inJerusalem nor is the tomb itself at Hebron ever visited. HereMoslems (soi disant) are allowed by the jealousies of Europe toclose and conceal a place which belongs to the world, especially toJews and Christians. The tombs, if they exist, lie in a vault orcave under the Mosque.[FN#234] Aba, or Abayah, vulg. Abayah, is a cloak of hair, goat'sor camel's; too well known to require description.[FN#235] Arab. "Al-Wakkad," the man who lights and keeps up thebath-fires.[FN#236] Arab. "Ma al-Khalaf" (or "Khilaf") a sickly perfume butmuch prized, made from the flowers of the Salix Aegyptiaca.[FN#237] Used by way of soap; like glasswort and other plants.[FN#238] i.e., "Thou art only just recovered."[FN#239] To "Nakh" is to gurgle "Ikh! Ikh!" till the camel kneels.Hence the space called "Barr al-Manakhah" in Al-Medinah (Pilgrimagei. 222, ii. 91). There is a regular camel vocabulary amongst theArabs, made up like our "Gee" (go ye!), etc. of significant wordsworn down.[FN#240] Arab. "Laza," the Second Hell provided for Jews.[FN#241] The word has been explained (vol. i. 112).[see Volume 1,note 199]  It is trivial, not occurring in the Koran which uses"Arabs of the Desert ;" "Arabs who dwell in tents," etc. (chaps.ix. and xxxiii.). "A'arabi" is the classical word and the origin of"Arab" is disputed. According to Pocock (Notae Spec. Hist. Arab.):"Diverse are the opinions concerning the denomination of the Arabs;but the most certain of all is that which draws it from Arabah,which is part of the region of Tehama (belonging to Al-MedinahPilgrimage ii. 118), which their father Ismail afterwardsinhabited." Tehamah (sierra caliente) is the maritime region of AlHijaz, the Moslems Holy Land; and its "Arabah," a very small tractwhich named a very large tract, must not be confounded, as somehave done, with the Wady Arabah, the ancient outlet of the DeadSea. The derivation of "Arab" from "Ya'arab" a fancied son ofJoktan is mythological. In Heb. Arabia may be called "Eretz Ereb"(or "Arab")=land of the West; but in Arabic "Gharb" (not Ereb) isthe Occident and the Arab dates long before the Hebrew.[FN#242] "When thine enemy extends his hand to thee, cut it off ifthou can, or kiss it," wisely said Caliph al-Mansur.[FN#243] The Tartur was a peculiar turban worn by the NorthernArabs and shown in old prints. In modern Egypt the term is appliedto the tall sugar-loaf caps of felt affected mostly by regularDervishes. Burckhardt (Proverbs 194 and 398) makes it the high capof felt or fur proper to the irregular cavalry called Dely orDelaty. In Dar For (Darfour) "Tartur" is a conical cap adorned withbeads and cowries worn by the Manghwah or buffoon who correspondswith the Egyptian "Khalbus" or "Maskharah" and the Turkish"Sutari." For an illustration see Plate iv. fig. 10 of Voyage auDarfour par Mohammed El Tounsy (The Tunisian), Paris, Duprat, 1845.[FN#244] The term is picturesque and true; we say "gnaw," which isnot so good.[FN#245] Here, meaning an Elder, a Chief, etc.; the word has beenalmost naturalised in English. I have noted that Abraham was thefirst "Shaykh."[FN#246] This mention of weighing suggests the dust of Dean Swiftand the money of the Gold Coast It was done, I have said, becausethe gold coin, besides being "sweated" was soft and was soon worndown.[FN#247] Fem. of Naji (a deliverer, a saviour)=Salvadora.[FN#248] This, I have noted, is according to Koranic command(chaps. iv. 88). "When you are saluted with a salutation, salutethe person with a better salutation." The longer answer to "Peacebe with (or upon) thee! " is still universally the custom. The"Salem" is so differently pronounced by every Eastern nation thatthe observant traveller will easily make of it a Shibboleth.[FN#249] The Badawi, who was fool as well as rogue, begins to fearthat he has kidnapped a girl of family.[FN#250] These examinations being very indecent are usually done instrictest privacy. The great point is to make sure of virginity.[FN#251] This is according to strict Moslem law: the purchaser maynot look at the girl's nakedness till she is his, and he ought tomanage matters through an old woman.[FN#252] Lit. wrath; affliction which chokes; in Hindustani itmeans simply anger.[FN#253] i.e. Heaven forbid I be touched by a strange man.[FN#254] Used for fuel and other purposes, such as making "dossstick."[FN#255] Arab "Yaftah'Allah" the offer being insufficient. Therascal is greedy as a Badaw and moreover he is a liar, which theBadawi is not.[FN#256] The third of the four great Moslem schools of Theology,taking its name from the Imam al-Shafi'i (Mohammed ibn Idris) whodied in Egypt A.H. 204, and lies buried near Cairo. (Sale's Prel.Disc. sect. viii.)[FN#257] The Moslem form of Cabbala, or transcendental philosophyof the Hebrews. [FN#258] Arab. "Bakh" the word used by the Apostle to Ali hisson-in-law. It is the Latin "Euge."[FN#259] Readers, who read for amusement, will do well to "skip"the fadaises of this highly educated young woman.[FN#260] There are three Persian Kings of this name (Artaxerxes)which means "Flour and milk," or "high lion." The text alludes toArdeshir Babegan, so called because he married the daughter ofBabak the shepherd, founder of the Sassanides in A.D. 202. SeeD,Herberot, and the Dabistan.[FN#261] Alluding to the proverb, "Folk follow their King's faith,""Cujus regio ejus religio" etc.[FN#262] Second Abbaside, A.H. 136-158 (=754-775).[FN#263] The celebrated companion of Mohammed who succeeded AbuBakr in the Caliphate (A.H. 13-23=634-644). The Sunnis know him asAl-Adil the Just, and the Shiahs detest him for his usurpation, hisausterity and harshness. It is said that he laughed once and weptonce. The laugh was caused by recollecting how he ate hisdough-gods (the idols of the Hanifah tribe) in The Ignorance. Thetears were drawn by remembering how he buried alive his babydaughter who, while the grave was being dug, patted away the dustfrom his hair and beard. Omar was doubtless a great man, but he isone of the most ungenial figures in Moslem history which does notabound in genialities. To me he suggests a Puritan, a Covenanter ofthe sourest and narrowest type; and I cannot wonder that thePersians abhor him, and abuse him on all occasions.[FN#264] The austere Caliph Omar whose scourge was more feared thanthe sword was the - author of the celebrated saying "Consult them(feminines) and do clear contrary-wise."[FN#265] Our "honour amongst thieves."[FN#266] The sixth successor of Mohammed and founder of the BanuUmayyah or Ommiades, called the "sons of the little mother" fromtheir eponymus (A.H. 41-60=661-680). For his Badawi wife Maysun,and her abuse of her husband, see Pilgrimage iii. 262.[FN#267] Shaykh of the noble tribe, or rather nation, Banu Tamimand a notable of the day, surnamed, no one knows why, "Sire of theSea."[FN#268] This is essential for cleanliness in hot lands: howevermuch the bath may be used, the body-pile and lower hair, ifsubmitted to a microscope, will show more or less sordes adherent.The axilla-hair is plucked because if shaved the growing pilecauses itching and the depilatories are held deleterious. At firstvellication is painful but the skin becomes used to it. The pectenis shaved either without or after using depilatories, of which morepresently. The body-pile is removed by "Takhfif"; the Liban Shami(Syrian incense), a fir- gum imported from Scio, is melted andallowed to cool in the form of a pledget. This is passed over theface and all the down adhering to it is pulled up by the roots(Burckhardt No. 420). Not a few Anglo-Indians have adopted theseprecautions[FN#269] This Caliph was a tall, fair, handsome man ofawe-inspiring aspect. Omar used to look at him and say, "This isthe Caesar of the Arabs," while his wife called him a "fatted ass."[FN#270] The saying is attributed to Abraham when "exercised" bythe unkindly temper of Sarah; "woman is made hard and crooked likea rib;" and the modern addition is, "whoso would straighten her,breaketh her."[FN#271] i.e. "When ready and in erection."[FN#272] "And do first (before going in to your wives) some actwhich may be profitable unto your souls" or, for you: soul's good.(Koran, chaps. ii. 223.) Hence Ahnaf makes this prayer.[FN#273] It was popularly said that "Truth-speaking left Omarwithout a friend." Entitled "The Just" he was murdered by AbuLuluah, alias Firuz, a (Magian ?) slave of Al-Maghirah for denyinghim justice.[FN#274] Governor of Bassorah under the first four Caliphs. SeeD'Herbelot s.v. "Aschari."[FN#275] Ziyad bin Abi Sufyan, illegitimate brother of the CaliphMu'awiyah afterwards governor of Bassorah, Cufa and Al-Hijaz.[FN#276] The seditions in Kufah were mainly caused by the wilfulnepotism of Caliph Othman bin Asakir which at last brought abouthis death. His main quality seems to have been personal beauty:"never was seen man or woman of fairer face than he and he was themost comely of men:" he was especially famed for beautiful teethwhich in old age he bound about with gold wire. He is described asof middling stature, large- limbed, broad shouldered, fleshy ofthigh and long in the fore-arm which was hairy. His face inclinedto yellow and was pock-marked; his beard was full and his curlyhair, which he dyed yellow, fell below his ears. He is called"writer of the Koran" from his edition of the M.S., and "Lord ofthe two Lights" because he married two of the Prophet's daughters,Rukayyah and Umm Kulthum; and, according to the Shi'ahs who callhim Othman-i-Lang or" limping Othman," he vilely maltreated them.They justify his death as the act of an Ijma' al-Muslimin, thegeneral consensus of Moslems which ratifies "Lynch law." AltogetherOthman is a mean figure in history.[FN#277] "Nar" (fire) is a word to be used delicately from itsconnection with Gehenna. You say, e.g. "bring me a light, a coal(bassah)" etc.; but if you say "bring me fire! " the enemy willprobably remark "He wanteth fire even before his time!" The slangexpression would be "bring the sweet." (Pilgrimage i. 121.)[FN#278] Omar is described as a man of fair complexion, and veryruddy, but he waxed tawny with age, when he also became bald andgrey. He had little hair on the cheeks but a long mustachio withreddish ends. In stature he overtopped the people and was stout ashe was tall. A popular saying of Mohammed's is, "All (very) longmen are fools save Omar, and all (very) short men are knaves saveAli." The Persians, who abhor Omar, compare every lengthy,ungainly, longsome thing with him; they will say, "This road neverends, like the entrails of Omar." We know little about Ali'sappearance except that he was very short and stout, broad andfull-bellied with a tawny complexion and exceedingly hairy, hislong beard, white as cotton, filling all the space between hisshoulders. He was a "pocket. Hercules," and incredible tales, likethat about the gates of Khaybar, are told of his strength. Lastly,he was the only Caliph who bequeathed anything to literature: his"Cantiloquium" is famous and he has left more than one mystical andprophetic work. See Ockley for his "Sentences" and D'Herbelot s. D."Ali" and "Gebr." Ali is a noble figure in Moslem history.[FN#279] The emancipation from the consequences of his sins; or itmay mean a holy death.[FN#280] Battle fought near Al-Medinah A.D. 625. The word isderived from "shad" (one).

He died. poisoned, it issaid, in A.H 101,[FN#287] Abu Bakr originally called Abd al-Ka'abah (slave of theKa'abah) took the name of Abdullah and was surnamed Abu Bakr(father of the virgin) when Mohammed, who before had married onlywidows, took to wife his daughter, the famous or infamous Ayishah."Bikr" is the usual form, but "Bakr," primarily meaning a youngcamel, is metaphorically applied to human youth (Lane's Lex. s.c.). The first Caliph was a cloth-merchant, like many of the Meccanchiefs. He is described as very fair with bulging brow, deep seteyes and thin-checked, of slender build and lean loined, stoopingand with the backs of his hands fleshless. He used tinctures ofHenna and Katam for his beard. The Persians who hate him, call him"Pir-i-Kaftar," the old she-hyaena, and believe that he wandersabout the deserts of Arabia in perpetual rut which the males mustsatisfy.[FN#288] The second, fifth, sixth and seventh Ommiades.[FN#289] The mother of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz was a granddaughter ofOmar bin al-Khattab.

For this Hajj al- Akbar see my Pilgrimage iii. 226. It isoften confounded by writers (even by the learned M. Caussin dePerceval) with the common Pilgrimage as opposed to the Umrah, or "Lesser Pilgrimage" (ibid. iii. 342, etc.). The latter meansetymologically cohabiting with a woman in her father's house asopposed to 'Ars or leading her to the husband's home: it is appliedto visiting Meccah and going through all the pilgrim-rites but notat the Pilgrimage-season. Hence its title "Hajj al-Asghar" the"Lesser Hajj." But "Umrah" is also applied to a certain ceremonybetween the hills Safa (a large hard rock) and Marwah (stone fullof flints), which accompanies the Hajj and which I have described(ibid. iii. 344). At Meccah I also heard of two places calledAl-Umrah, the Greater in the Wady Fatimah and the Lesser half waynearer the city (ibid. iii. 344).[FN#294] A fair specimen of the unworthy egoism which all religioussystems virtually inculcate Here a pious father leaves his childrenmiserable to save his own dirty soul. [FN#295] Chief of the Banu Tamin, one of the noblest of tribes,derived from Tamim, the uncle of Kuraysh (Koreish); hence the poetssang:--     There cannot be a son nobler than Kuraysh,     Nor an uncle nobler than Tamim.The high minded Tamin is contrasted with the mean-spirited Kays,who also gave rise to a tribe; and hence the saying concerning oneabsolutely inconsistent, "Art thou now Tamin and then Kays?"[FN#296] Surnamed Al-Sakafi, Governor of Al-Yaman and Irak.[FN#297] Tenth Ommiade (regn.

The father whispers it in the right ear, oftenadding the Azan or prayer-call, and repeating in the left ear the"Ikamah" or Friday sentence. There are many rules for choosingnames according to the week-day, the ascendant planet, the "SortesCoranicae," etc.[FN#301] Amongst Moslems as amongst Christians there are sevendeadly sins: idolatry, murder, falsely charging modest women withunchastity, robbing orphans, usury, desertion in Holy War anddisobedience to parents. The difference between the two creeds isnoteworthy. And the sage knows only three, intemperance, ignoranceand egoism.[FN#302] Meaning, "It was decreed by Destiny; so it came to pass,"appropriate if not neat.[FN#303] The short, stout, dark, long-haired and two-bunched camelfrom "Bukhtar" (Bactria), the "Eastern" (Bakhtar) region on the Amuor Jayhun (Oxus) River; afterwards called Khorasan.

"Aylulain" is slumberingafter morning prayers (our "beauty-sleep"), causing heaviness andidleness: "Ghaylulah" is dozing about 9 a.m. engendering poverty andwretchedness: "Kaylulah" (with the guttural Kaf) is sleeping beforeevening prayers and "Faylulah" is slumbering after sunset--bothheld to be highly detrimental.

It is still famous for the water-wheels mentioned byal-Hariri (assembly of the Banu Haram).[FN#306] When they say, "The levee flashes bright on the hills ofAl-Yaman," the allusion is to the south quarter, wheresummer-lightning is seen. Al-Yaman (always with the article) means,I have said, the right-hand region to one facing the rising sun andAl-Sham (Syria) the left-hand region.[FN#307] Again "he" for "she," in delicacy and jealousy of makingpublic the beauty or conditions of the "veiled sex."

Richardson derives it from Namsh,being freckled (damasked).[FN#327] The Indian term for a tent large enough to cover a troopof cavalry.[FN#328] Arab. "Marhum" a formula before noticed. It is borrowedfrom the Jewish, "of blessed memory" (after the name of thehonoured dead, Prov. x. 17.); with the addition of "upon whom bepeace," as opposed to the imprecation, "May the name of the wickedrot!"[FN#329] The speeches of the five damsels should be read only bystudents.[FN#330] i.e. Those who look for "another and a better."[FN#331] The title of Caliph Abu Bakr because he bore truthfulwitness to the Apostle's mission or, others say, he confirmed the"Mi'raj" or nocturnal journey to Heaven.[FN#332] All this is Koranic (chaps. ii., etc.).[FN#333] This may have applied more than once to "hanging judges"in the Far West.[FN#334] A traditionist and jurisconsult of Al-Medinah in theseventh and eighth centuries.[FN#335] The Alexander of the Koran and Eastern legends, not to beconfounded with the Alexander of Macedon.

"Shirk," giving a partner to Allah, attendingchiefly to Christians and idolaters and in a minor degree to Jewsand Guebres. We usually English it by "polytheism," which is clumsyand conveys a wrong idea[FN#345] Grandson of the Caliph Ali. He is one of the Imams(High-priests) of the Shi'ah school.[FN#346] An eminent traditionist of the eighth century (A.D.).[FN#347] The prayers of the Fast-month and Pilgrimage-month areoften said in especial places outside the towns and cities; theseare the Indian Id(Eed-)gah. They have a screen of wall about ahundred yards long with a central prayer-niche and the normal threesteps for the preacher; and each extremity is garnished with animitation minaret. They are also called Namaz-gah and one issketched by Herklots (Plate iii. fig. 2). The object of the tripsthither in Zu'l-Ka'adah and Zu'l-Hijjah is to remind Moslems of the"Ta'arif," or going forth from Meccah to Mount Arafat.[FN#348] Arab. "Al-Hafi," which in Egyptian means sore-footed aswell. He was an ascetic of the eighth and ninth centuries (A.D.).He relates a tradition of the famous soldier saint Khalid bin Walidwho lies buried like the poet Ka'ab al-Ahbar near Hums (Emessa)once the Boeotia, Phrygia, Abdera, Suabia of Syria now Halbun(pronounced Halbaun) near Damascus. I cannot explain how thisKuraysh noble (a glorious figure in Moslem history) is claimed bythe Afghans as one of their countrymen and made to speak Pukhtu orPushtu, their rough old dialect of Persian. The curious reader willconsult my Pilgrimage iii. 322 for the dialogue between Mohammedand Khalid. Again there is general belief in Arabia that theEnglish sent a mission to the Prophet, praying that Khalid might bedespatched to proselytise them: unfortunately Mohammed was dead andthe "Ingriz" ratted. It is popularly held that no armed man canapproach Khalid's grave; but I suppose my revolver did not count.[FN#349] When he must again wash before continuing prayer.[FN#350] Bin Adham; another noted ascetic of the eighth century.Those curious about these unimportant names will consult the greatBiographical Dictionary of Ibn Khallikan, translated by BaronMacGuckin de Slane (1842-45).[FN#351] Thus making Bishr the "Imam" (artistes) lit. one whostands in front. In Koran xvii. 74 it means "leader": in ii. 118Allah makes Abraham an "Imam to mankind."[FN#352] A favourite sentiment in the East: we find it at the verybeginning of Sa'di's Gulistan: better a weal-bringing lie than aharm-dealing truth.[FN#353] A penny, one sixth of the drachma.[FN#354] Founder of the Hanbali, fourth (in date) of the fourorthodox Moslem schools. The Caliph al-Mu'atasim bi'llah, son ofHarun al-Rashid, who believed the Koran to have been created andnot a Logos (whatever that may be), co-eternal with Allah, scourgedthis Imam severely for "differing in opinion" (A.H. 220=833). Infact few of the notable reverends of that day escaped without acaress of the scourge or the sword.[FN#355] A learned man of the eighth century at Bassorah (A.D.).[FN#356] A traditionist of Khorasan in the ninth century (A.D.).[FN#357] "Azal," opp. to "Abad," eternity without end, infinity.[FN#358] Koran lxvi. 6.[FN#359] A traditionist of Al-Medinah, eighth century (A.D.).[FN#360] Arab. "Musa": the Egyptian word was "Mesu," the "child" orthe "boy" (brought up in the palace?), and the Hebrews made it"Mosheh" or "one drawn out of the water;" "Mu" in Egypt beingwater, the Arab "Ma"; whence probably the moderns have derived thedim. "Moyeh ," vulg. Egyptian for water.[FN#361] Koran, chaps. xxviii.: Shu'ayb is our Jethro: Koran,chaps. vii. and xi. Mr. Rodwell suggests (p. 101) that the name hasbeen altered from Hobab (Numb. x. 29).[FN#362] Arab. "Taub" (Saub), the long shirt popularly written inEnglish Tobe and pronounced so by Egyptians. It is worn by bothsexes (Lane, M. E. chaps. i. "Tob") in Egypt, and extends into theheart of Moslem Africa: I can compare it with nothing but a longnightgown dyed a dirty yellow by safflower and about as picturesqueas a carter's smock-frock.[FN#363] There is nothing of this in the Koran; and it is a mostunhappy addition, as Moses utterly and pretentiously ignored a"next world."[FN#364] Koran xxviii. 22-27. Mohammed evidently confounded thecontract between Laban and Jacob. (Gen. xxix. 15-39.)[FN#365] So says Al-Hariri (Ass. of Sasan), "The neighbour beforethe house and the traveller before the journey." In certain citiesthe neighbourhood is the real detective police, noting every actionand abating scandals (such as orgies, etc.) with a strong hand andwith the full consent of public opinion and of the authorities.This loving the neighbour shows evident signs of being borrowedfrom Christianity.[FN#366] Al-Asamm a theologian of Balkh, ninth century (A.D.).[FN#367] The founder of the Senior School, for which see Sale Prel.Disc. sect. viii.[FN#368] Thus serving the Lord by sinning against his own body.[FN#369] An Egyptian doctor of the law (ninth century).[FN#370] Koran lxxvii. 35, 36.

"Rival al-Ghayb," somewhat like the "HimalayanBrothers" of modern superstition. See Herklots (Qanoon-e-Islam) fora long and careful description of these "Mardan-i-Ghayb" (Pers.),a "class of people mounted on clouds," invisible, but moving in acircular orbit round the world, and suggesting the Hindu"Lokapalas." They should not be in front of the traveller nor onhis right, but either behind or on his left hand. Hence tables,memorial couplets and hemistichs are required to ascertain thestation, without which precaution journeys are apt to end badly.[FN#374] A sweetmeat before noticed.[FN#375] Door hinges in the east are two projections for the topand bottom of the leaf playing in hollows of the lintel andthreshold. It appears to be the primitive form, for we find it inthe very heart of Africa.

My sympathies are all withthe old woman who nightly punished the royal lecher.[FN#378] Arab. "Zunnar," the Gr. {Greek letters}. Christians andJews were compelled by the fanatical sumptuary laws of the CaliphAl-Mutawakkil (AD. 856) to wear a broad leather belt in public,hence it became a badge of the Faith. Probably it was confoundedwith the "Janeo" (Brahmanical thread) and the Parsi sacred girdlecalled Kashti. (Dabistan i, 297, etc.). Both Mandeville and LaBrocquiere speak of "Christians of the Girdle, because they are allgirt above," intending Jacobites or Nestorians.[FN#379] "Silah dar" (Arab. and Pers.)=a military officer of highrank; literally an "armour-bearer," chosen for velour andtrustworthiness. So Jonathan had a "young man" (brave) who bare hisarmour (I Sam. xiv. 1, 6 and 7); and Goliath had a man that barethe shield before him (ibid. xvii. 7, 41). Men will not readilyforget the name of Sulayman Agha, called the Silahdar, in Egypt.(Lane M. E. chaps. iv.)[FN#380] It will be told afterwards.[FN#381] The elder brother thus showed himself a vassal and provedhimself a good Moslem by not having recourse to civil war.[FN#382] Arab. "Ghazwah," the corrupt Gallicism, nowEuropeanised=raid, foray.[FN#383] Turk in modern parlance means a Turkoman, a pomade: thesettled people call themselves Osmanli or Othmanli. Turkoman=Turk-like.[FN#384] Arab. "Nimsa;" southern Germans, Austrians; from the Slav."Nemica" (any Germans), literally meaning "The dumb" (nemac),because they cannot speak Slav.[FN#385] Arab. "Dubara" from the Slav. "Dubrovnik," from "Dub" (anoak) and "Dubrava" (an oak forest). Ragusa, once a rival of Venice,gave rise to the word "Argosy." D'Herbelot calls it "Dobravenedik"or "Good Venice," the Turkish name, because it paid tribute whenVenice would not (?).[FN#386] Arab. "Jawarnah," or, "Jurnah" evidently Zara, a place ofmany names, Jadera (Hirtius de Bell. Alex. cap. 13), Jadra, Zadra(whence the modern term), Diadora, Diadosca and Jadrossa. Thisimportant Liburnian city sent forth many cruisers in crusadingdays; hence the Arabs came to know its name.[FN#387] Arab. "Banu'l-Asfar;" which may mean "Pale faces," in thesense of "yeller girls" (New Orleans) and that intended by NorthAmerican Indians, or, possibly, the peoples with yellow (or rathertow-coloured) hair we now call Russians. The races of Hindostanterm the English not "white men," but "red men;" and the reasonwill at once be seen by comparing a Britisher with a high-casteNagar Brahman whose face is of parchment colour as if he had drunkexsangue cuminum. The Yellow-faces of the text correspond with theSansk. "Svetadvipa"--Whiteman's Land.[FN#388] Arab. "Al-Musakhkham." No Moslem believes that Isa wascrucified and a favourite fancy is that Judas, changed to thelikeness of Jesus, thus paid for his treason. (Evangel. Barnabae.)Hence the resurrection is called not "Kiyamah" but"Kumamah"=rubbish. This heresy about the Cross they share with theDocetes, "certain beasts in the shape of men" (says Ignatius), whoheld that a phantom was crucified. So far the Moslems are logical,for "Isa," being angelically, miraculously and immaculatelyconceived, could not be; but they contradict themselves when theyhold a vacant place near Mohammed's tomb for the body of Isa afterhis second coming as a forerunner to Mohammed and Doomday.(Pilgrimage ii. 89.)[FN#389] A diviner, priest, esp. Jewish, and not belonging to thetribe of Levi.[FN#390] Again the coarsest word "Khara." The allusion is to thevulgar saying, "Thou eatest skite!" (i.e. thou talkest nonsense).Decent English writers modify this to, "Thou eatest dirt:" and LordBeaconsfield made it ridiculous by turning it into "eating sand."[FN#391] These silly scandals, which cause us only to smile, exciteEasterns to fury. I have seen a Moslem wild with rage on hearing aChristian parody the opening words of the Koran, "Bismillahi 'l-Rahmani 'l-Rahim, Mismish wa Kamar al-din," roughly translated, "In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate!Apricots and marmalede." The idea of the Holy Merde might have beensuggested by the Hindus: see Mandeville, of the archiprotopapaton(prelate) carrying ox-dung and urine to the King, who therewithanoints his brow and breast, &c. And, incredible to relate, this isstill practiced after a fashion by the Parsis, one of the mostprogressive and the sharpest witted of Asiatic races.[FN#392] Meaning that he had marked his brow with a cross (ofashes?) as certain do on Ash Wednesday.[FN#393] Syria, the "left-hand land" as has before been explained.The popular saying about its people is "Shami shumi!"--the Syrianis small potatoes (to render the sense Americanice). Nor did Syrus,the slave in Roman days, bear the best of names. In Al-Hijaz theSyrian is addressed "Abu Sham" (Father of Syria) and insulted as"Abuser of the Salt" (a traitor). Yet many sayings of Mohammed arerecorded in honour of Syria, and he sometimes used Syriac words.Such were "Bakh, bakh" (=euge, before noticed), and "Kakh," acongener of the Latin Cacus and Caca which our day has docked to"cack." (Pilgrimage iii. 115)[FN#394] Koran xiv. 34. "They (Unbelievers) shall be thrown therein(i.e., the House of Perdition=Hell); and an unhappy dwelling shallit be."[FN#395] The leg-cut is a prime favourite with the Eastern Sworder,and a heavy two-handed blade easily severs a horse's leg.[FN#396] Mohammed repeatedly declared (Koran lxi.) that theChristians had falsified the passage ("I go to my Father and theParaclete shall come," John xvi. 7) promising the advent of theComforter, {Greek letters} (ibid. xiv. 20; xv. 26) by substitutingthe latter word for {Greek letters} glorious, renowned, i.e., Ahmedor Mohammed=the praised one. This may have been found in the Arabictranslation of the Gospels made by Warakah, cousin to Mohammed'sfirst wife; and hence in Koran lxi. we find Jesus prophesying of anApostle "whose name shall be Ahmad." The word has consequently beeninserted into the Arabic Gospel of Saint Barnabas (Dabistan iii.67). Moslems accept the Pentateuch, the Psalter and the Gospel; butassert (Koran, passim.) that all extant copies have been hopelesslycorrupted, and they are right. Moses, to whom the Pentateuch isattributed, notices his own death and burial--"the mair themiracle," said the old Scotch lady. The "Psalms of David" rangeover a period of some five hundred years, and there are threeIsaiahs who pass with the vulgar for one. The many apocryphalGospels, all of which have been held genuine and canonical atdifferent times and in different places, prove that the four, whichare still in use, were retained because they lack the manifestabsurdities of their discarded rivals.[FN#397] Arab. " Labbayka; " the Pilgrimage-cry (Night xxii.) whichin Arabic is,     Labbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!     La Sharika lake, Labbayk'!     Inna 'l-hamda w'al ni'amata lake wa'l mulk!     Labbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!Some add "Here am I, and I honour Thee, the son of Thy two slaves;beneficence and good are all between Thy hands."With the "Talbiyah"the pilgrims should bless the Prophet, pray Allah to grant Heavenand exclaim, "By Thy mercy spare us from the pains of Hell-fire!"(Pilgrimage iii. 232.) Labbayka occurs in the verses attributed toCaliph Ali; so labba=he faced, and yalubbu=it faces (as one housefaces another); lastly, he professed submission to Allah; in whichsense, together with the verbal noun "Talbiyah," it is used by Al-Hanri (Pref. and Ass. of Su'adah).[FN#398] Arab. "Kissis" (plur. Kusus) from '            .[FN#399] Koran ii. The "red cow" is evidently the "red heifer" ofBarnabas, chaps. vii.[FN#400] Arab. "Al-Jasalik"={Greek letters}.[FN#401] This is from the first "Gospel of Infancy," wherein Jesussaid to his mother, "Verily I am Jesus, the Son of God, the Wordwhich thou hast brought forth, as the Angel Gabriel did declareunto thee; and my Father hath sent me to save the world" (chaps. i.2.). The passage is virtually quoted in the Koran (chaps. iii.141), of course omitting " the Son of God"[FN#402] Mohammed allowed his locks to grow down to his ear-lobesbut never lower.[FN#403] Arab. "Lisam" I have explained as a covering for the lowerface, made by drawing over it the corner of the head-kerchief(Pilgrimage i. 346). The Lisam of the African Tawarik hoods theeyes so that a man must turn up his face to see, and swathes allthe lower half, leaving only the nose exposed. And this is worn bymany men by night as well as by day, doubtless to avoid the evileye. The native Sultans of Darfur, like those of Bornu and othersfurther west, used white muslin as a face-wrap: hence, too, theceremonies when spitting, etc., etc. The Kufiyah or head-kerchiefof the Arabs soon reached Europe and became in Low Latin Cuphia; inSpanish Escofia; in Ital. Cuffia or Scuffia; in French Escoffion,Scofion (Reine Marguerite) Coeffe (une pellicule, marque debonheur) Coiffe and Coife, &c.; the Scotch Curch or Coif, opposedto the maiden snood, and, lastly our Sergeant-at-Law's Coif.Littre, the Learned, who in erudition was ne coiffe, has missedthis obvious derivation.[FN#404] "Cutting," throughout the book, alludes to the scymitarwith which Arabs never give point; and "thrusting" to the footman'sspear and the horseman's lance.[FN#405] A popular phrase, I repeat, for extreme tenor andconsternation.[FN#406] The name usually applies to a well-known district and cityof Al Yaman, where "Koss the eloquent" was bishop in Mohammed'sday: the Negiran of D'Herbelot. Here, however, it is the SyrianNajran (Nejran of Missionary Porter's miserable Handbook), now awretched village near the volcanic Lajja, about one hundred andtwenty miles direct south of Damascus and held by Druzes andChristians.[FN#407] The Kantar (quintal) of 100 ratls (Ibs.) =98-99 Ibs.avoir.[FN#408] Arab. "Jurab (bag) mi'adat- ih (of his belly)," the"curdling of the testicles" in fear is often mentioned.[FN#409] Clearly alluding to the magic so deeply studied bymediaeval Jews.[FN#410] Arab. "Sahakah," lit. rubbing. The Moslem Harem is a greatschool for this "Lesbian (which I would call Atossan) love "; butthe motive of the practice lies deeper. As amongst men the mixtureof the feminine with the masculine temperament leads to sodomy, sothe reverse makes women prefer their own sex. These tribades aremostly known by peculiarities of form and features, hairy cheeksand upper lips, gruff voices, hircine odour and the largeprojecting clitoris with erectile powers known to the Arabs as"bazar" hence Tabzir=circumcision or amputation of such clitoris.Burckhardt (Prov. 436) translates " Bazarah" by slut or wench. Headds " it originally signifies the labia which the Cairenes alsoentice Zambur and which are cut off in girlhood." See also Lane,Lex. s.v.; Tabzir. Both writers confuse excision of the nymphaewith circumcision of the clitoris (Zambur) Al-Siyuti (Kitab al-Iza'fi'Ilm al-Nikah) has a very interesting chapter on Sapphic venery,which is well known to Europe as proved by such works as "Gamiani,"and "Anandria ou Confessions de Mademoiselle Sappho, avec la Clef,"Lesbos, 1718. Onanism is fatally prevalent: in many Harems andgirls' schools tallow candles and similar succedanea are vainlyforbidden and bananas when detected are cut into four so as to beuseless; of late years, however, China has sent some marvellousartificial phalli of stuffed bladder, horn and even caoutchouc, thelatter material of course borrowed from Europe.[FN#411] This is considered a powerful aphrodisiac in the East.Hence male devotees are advised to avoid tile "two reds," i.e. meatand wine; while the "two reds," which corrupt women, are gold andsaffron, that is perfumery. Hence also the saying of Mohammed:--"Perfumes for men should have scent and not colour; for womenshould have colour and not scent." (Mishkat al-Masabih ii. 361.)[FN#412] These are the "Hibas" or thin cords of wool which theBadawi binds round his legs, I believe to keep off cramp.(Pilgrimage iii. 78).[FN#413] Crying out "La ilaha illa 'llah." (There is no god but theGod.); technically called "Tahlil."[FN#414] i.e. Men, angels and devils, the "Triloka" (triple people)of the Hindus. Alamin (plur.), never Alamayn (dual), is theTriregno denoted by the papal Tiara, the three Christian kingdomsbeing Heaven, Hell and Purgatory.[FN#415] Matrahinna or Mit-Rahinah is a well-known village nearMemphis, the name being derived from the old Egyptian Minat-ro-hinnu, the port at the mouth of the canal. Let me remark that twoof these three words, "Minat" and "Ru," are still common in "Aryan" Persian.[FN#416] Kiramat, a sign, a prodigy, opposed to Mu'ujizah, amiracle wrought by a prophet. The Sufis explain this thaumaturgy byAllah changing something of Nature's ordinary course in favour ofan especial worshipper, and, after a fashion, this is Catholicdoctrine (See Dabistan, iii. 173).[FN#417] Koran, x. 25, "until the earth receive its vesture and beadorned with various plants."[FN#418] i.e. the young hair sprouting on the boy's cheek.[FN#419] A fighter for the faith and now a title which follows thename, e.g. Osman Pasha Ghazi, whom the English press dubbed "GhaziOsman."[FN#420] That is the King of Constantinople.[FN#421] Cassia fistularis, a kind of carob: " Shambar" is theArab. form of the Persian " Chambar."[FN#422] Koran, ii. 149. Hence the vulgar idea that Martyrs arestill alive in the flesh. See my Pilgrimage (ii. 110 and elsewhere)for the romantic and picturesque consequences of that belief. TheCommentators (Jalal al-Din, etc.) play tricks with the Koranicwords, " they (martyrs) are not dead but living" (iii. 179) byplacing the happy souls in the crops of green birds which eat ofthe fruits and drink of the waters of Paradise; whereas thereprobates and the (very) wicked are deposited in black birds whichdrain the sanies and the boiling waters of Hell. Amongst the Greeksa body remaining entire long after death suggests AnathemaMaranatha: it is the contrary with Catholic Christians (Boccaccioiv. 5, of the Pot of Basil). Concerning this creed see Maundrell,Letter of 1698.[FN#423] Tor is "Mount Sinai" in the Koran (xcv. 1). I have only torepeat my opinion concerning the present site so called: "It isevident that Jebel Serbal dates only from the early days of CopticChristianity; that Jebel Musa, its Greek rival, rose after thevisions of Helena in the fourth century; whilst the building of theConvent by Justinian belongs to A.D 527. Ras Safsafah, its rival tothe north, is an affair of yesterday, and may be called theinvention of Robinson; and Jebel Katerina, to the south is theproperty of Ruppell" (Midian Revisited i., 237). I would thereforecall the "Sinaitic" Peninsula, Peninsula of Paran in old days andPeninsula of Tor (from its chief port) in our time. It is still myconviction that the true Mount Sinai will be found in Jabal Araif,or some such unimportant height to the north of the modern Hajj-road from Suez to Akabah. Even about the name (which the Koranwrites "Saina" and "Sinin") there is a dispute: It is usuallyderived from the root "Sanah"=sentis, a bush; but this is notsatisfactory. Our eminent Assyriologist, Professor Sayce, wouldconnect it with "Sin," the Assyrian Moon- god as Mount Nebo withthe Sun-god and he expects to find there the ruins of a Lunartemple as a Solar fane stands on Ba'al Zapuna (Baal Zephon) or theclassical Mount Casius.[FN#424] Alluding to the miracle of Aaron's rod (the gift ofJethro) as related in the Koran (chapts. vii. 1., xx., etc.), wherethe Egyptian sorcerers threw down thick ropes which by their magictwisted and coiled like serpents.[FN#425] Arab. "Ayat" lit. "signs," here "miracles of the truth,"1. c. Koranic versets as opposed to chapters. The ranks of theenemy represent the latter, sword-cuts the former--a verypersuasive mode of preaching.[FN#426] Lane (M. E. chapt.. iii.) shows by a sketch the positionof the worshipper during this "Salam" which is addressed, some say,to the guardian angels, others suppose to all brother-believers andangels.[FN#427] i.e., where the Syrians found him.[FN#428] i.e., Dedianus Arabised; a name knightly and plebian.[FN#429] In such tales the Wazir is usually the sharp-witted man,contrasting with the "dummy," or master.[FN#430] Carrier-pigeons were extensively used at this time. TheCaliph Al-Nasir li-Dini 'llah (regn. A.H. 575=1180) was, accordingto Ibn Khaldun, very fond of them. The moderns of Damascus stillaffect them. My successor, Mr. Consul Kirby Green, wrote anexcellent report on pigeon-fancying at Damascus. The so-calledMaundeville or Mandeville in A. D. 1322 speaks of carrier-pigeonsin Syria as a well-known mode Of intercourse between lord and lord.[FN#431] Mohammed who declared "There is no monkery in Al-Islam,"and who virtually abolished the priest, had an especial aversion tothe shaveling (Ruhban). But the "Gens aeterna in qua nemo nascitur"(Pliny v. 17) managed to appear even in Al-lslam, as Fakirs,,Dervishes, Sufis, etc. Of this more hereafter.[FN#432] i.e. her holiness would act like a fascinating talisman.[FN#433] The "smoking out" practice is common amongst the Arabs:hence Marshal Pelissier's so- called " barbarity." The Public isapt to forget that on a campaign the general's first duty is tosave his own men by any practice which the laws of fair warfare donot absolutely forbid.[FN#434] i.e. Mohammed, who promised Heaven and threatened Hell.[FN#435] Arab. "Ahr" or "ihr," fornication or adultery, i.e.,irreligion, infidelity as amongst the Hebrews (Isaiah xxiii.17).[FN#436] A sign of defeat.[FN#437] In English "last night": I have already noted that theMoslem day, like the Jewish and the Scandinavian, begins atsundown; and "layl " a night, is often used to denote the twenty-four hours between sunset and sunset, whilst "yaum," a day, wouldby us be translated in many cases "battle-day."[FN#438] Iterum the "Himalayan Brothers."[FN#439] Again, Mohammed who promised Good to the Good, and viceversa.[FN#440] They are sad doggrel like most of the pieces d'occasioninserted in The Nights.[FN#441] Here "Kahwah" (coffee) is used in its original sense ofstrong old wine. The derivation is "Akha"=fastidire fecit, causingdisinclination for food, the Matambre (kill- hunger) of theIberians. In old days the scrupulous called coffee "Kihwah" inorder to distinguish it from 'Kakwah," wine.[FN#442] i.e. Mohammed, a common title.[FN#443] That is, fatal to the scoffer and the impious.[FN#444] Equivalent to our "The Devil was sick," etc.[FN#445] i.e. to the enemy: the North American Indians (so called)use similar forms of "inverted speech"; and the Australianaborigines are in no way behind them.[FN#446] See Vol. i., p. 154 (Night xvi.).[FN#447] Arab. "Sauf," a particle denoting a near future whereas"Sa-" points to one which may be very remote.[FN#448] From the root "Shanh"=having a fascinating eye,terrifying. The Irish call the fascinater "eybitter" and the victim(who is also rhymed to death) "eybitten."[FN#449] i.e., not like the noble-born, strong in enduring thestress of fight.[FN#450] i.e., of Abraham. For the Well Zemzem and the Place ofAbraham see my Pilgrimage (iii. 171-175, etc.), where I describedthe water as of salt-bitter taste, like that of Epsom (iii. 203).Sir William Muir (in his excellent life of Mahomet, I. cclviii.)remarks that "the flavour of stale water bottled up for monthswould not be a criterion of the same water freshly drawn;" butsoldered tins-full of water drawn a fortnight before are to be hadin Calcutta and elsewhere after Pilgrimage time; and analysis wouldat once detect the salt.[FN#451] Racing was and is a favourite pastime with thosehippomanists, the Arabs; but it contrasts strongly with ourcivilised form being a trial of endurance rather than of speed. TheProphet is said to have limited betting in these words, "Thereshall be no wagering save on the Kuff (camel's foot), the Hafir(hoof of horse, ass, etc.) or the Nasal (arrow-pile or lancehead)."[FN#452] In the Mac. Edit. "Arman"=Armenia, which has beforeoccurred. The author or scribe here understands by "Caesarea" notthe old Turris Stratonis, Herod's city called after Augustus, butCaesareia the capital of Cappadocia (Pliny, vi. 3), the royalresidence before called Mazaca (Strabo).[FN#453] An idiom meaning "a very fool."[FN#454] i.e. Kana (was) ma (that which) was (kana).[FN#455] A son being "the lamp of a dark house."[FN#456] When the Israelites refused to receive the Law (the soulsof all the Prophets even those unborn being present at theCovenant), Allah tore up the mountain (Sinai which is notmentioned) by the roots and shook it over their heads to terrifythem, saying, "Receive the Law which we have given you with aresolution to keep it" (Koran chaps. xlx. 170). Much of this storyis from the Talmud (Abodah Sar. 2, 2, Tract Sabbath, etc.) whenceAl-Islam borrowed so much of its Judaism, as it took Christianityfrom the Apocryphal New Testament. This tradition is still held bythe Israelites, says Mr. Rodwell (p. 333) who refers it to amisunderstanding of Exod. xix. 17, rightly rendered in the E.version "at the nether part of the mountain."[FN#457] Arab. "Azghan" = the camel-litters in which women travel.[FN#458] i.e. to joy foes and dismay friends.[FN#459] Whose eyes became white (i.e. went blind) with mourningfor his son Joseph (Koran, chaps. xii. 84). He recovered his sightwhen his face was covered with the shirt which Gabriel had given tothe youth after his brethren had thrown him into the well.[FN#460] "Poison King" (Persian); or "Flower-King" (Arabic).[FN#461] A delicate allusion to the size of her hips and backparts, in which volume is, I have said, greatly admired for thebest of reasons.[FN#462] All Prophets had some manual trade and that of David wasmaking coats of mail, which he invented, for before his day menused plate-armour. So "Allah softened the iron for him" and in hishands it became like wax (Koran xxi. xxxiv., etc.). Hence a goodcoat of mail is called "Davidean." I have noticed (First Footsteps,p. 33 and elsewhere) the homage paid to the blacksmith on theprinciple which made Mulciber (Malik Kabir) a god. The myth ofDavid inventing mail possibly arose from his peculiarly fightingcareer. Moslems venerate Daud on account of his extraordinarydevotion, nor has this view of his character ceased : a moderndivine preferred him to "all characters in history."[FN#463] "Travel by night," said the Prophet, "when the plagues ofearth (scorpions, serpents, etc.) afflict ye not." Yet the night-march in Arabia is detestable (Pilgrimage iii.).[FN#464] This form of ceremony is called "Istikbal" (coming forthto greet) and is regulated by the severest laws of etiquette. As arule the greater the distance (which may be a minimum of one step)the higher the honour. Easterns infinitely despise strangers whoignore these vitals of politeness.[FN#465] i.e. he will be a desert Nimrod and the game will delightto be killed by him.[FN#466] This serves to keep the babe's eyes free frominflammation.[FN#467] i.e. Crown of the Kings of amorous Blandishment.[FN#468] Lane (i. 531) translates "the grey down." The Arabs use"Akhzar" (prop. "green") in many senses, fresh, gray-hued, etc.[FN#469] Allusion to the well-known black banners of the house ofAbbas. The Persians describe the growth of hair on a fair youngface by, "His cheeks went into mourning for the loss of theircharms."[FN#470] Arab. "Kafir" a Koranic word meaning Infidel, the activeparticiple of Kufr= Infidelity i.e. rejecting the mission ofMohammed. It is insulting and in Turkish has been degraded to"Giaour." Here it means black, as Hafiz of Shiraz terms a cheekmole "Hindu" i.e. dark-skinned and idolatrous.[FN#471] Alluding to the travel of Moses (Koran chaps. xviii.) withAl-Khizr (the "evergreen Prophet") who had drunk of the Fountain ofLife and enjoyed flourishing and continual youth. Moses isrepresented as the external and superficial religionist; the man ofoutsight; Al-Khizr as the spiritual and illuminated man of insight.[FM#472] The lynx was used like the lion in Ancient Egypt and theChita-leopard in India: I have never seen or heard of it in thesedays.[FN#473] Arab. "Sukur," whence our "Saker" the falcon, not to beconfounded with the old Falco Sacer, the Gr. {Greek letters}.Falconry which, like all arts, began in Egypt, is an extensivesubject throughout Moslem lands. I must refer my readers to"Falconry in the Valley of the Indus" (Van Voorst, 1852) and a longnote in Pilgrimage iii. 71.[FN#474] It was not respectful to pitch their camp within dog-bark.[FN#475] Easterns attach great importance to softness andsmoothness of skin and they are right: a harsh rough epidermisspoils sport with the handsomest woman.[FN#476] Canticles vii. 8: Hosea xiv. 6.[FN#477] The mesmeric attraction of like to like.[FN#478] Arab. "Taswif"=saying "Sauf," I will do it soon. It is abeautiful word etymologically.[FN#479] A very far fetched allusion. The face of the belovedspringing from an unbuttoned robe is the moon rising over the campin the hollow (bat'ha).[FN#480] Arab. "Kasabat" = "canes," long beads, bugles.[FN#481] Koran, xcvi. 5.[FN#482] Both words (masc. and fem.) mean "dear, excellent, highly-prized." The tale is the Arab form of the European "PatientGriselda" and shows a higher conception of womanly devotion,because Azizah, despite her wearisome weeping, is a girl of highintelligence and Aziz is a vicious zany, weak as water and wilfulas wind. The phenomenon (not rare in life) is explained by thecouplet:--     I love my love with an S      Because he is stupid and not intellectual.This fond affection of clever women for fools can be explained onlyby the law of unlikeness which mostly governs sexual unions inphysical matters; and its appearance in the story gives novelty andpoint. Aziz can plead only the violence of his passion whichdistinguished him as a lover among the mob of men who cannot loveanything beyond themselves. And none can pity him for losing amember which he so much abused.[FN#483] Arab. "Shahid," the index, the pointer raised intestimony: the comparison of the Eastern and the Western names iscurious.[FN#484] Musk is one of the perfumes of the Moslem Heaven; and"musky" is much used in verse to signify scented and dark-brown.[FN#485] Arab. "Mandil": these kerchiefs are mostly oblong, theshore sides being worked with gold and coloured silk, and oftenfringed, while the two others are plain.[FN#486] Arab. "Rayhani," of the Ocymum Basilicum or sweet basil:a delicate handwriting, so called from the pen resembling a leaf(?) See vol. i. p. 128. [Volume 1, note 229 & 230][FN#487] All idiom meaning "something unusual happened."[FN#488] An action common in grief and regret: here the lady wouldshow that she sighs for union with her beloved.[FN#489] Lane (i. 608) has a valuable note on the language ofsigns, from M. du Vigneau's "Secretaire Turc," etc. (Paris, 1688),Baron von Hammer-Purgstall ("Mines de ['Orient," No. 1, Vienna,1809) and Marcel's "Comes du Cheykh El-Mohdy" (Paris, 1833). It ispracticed in Africa as well as in Asia. At Abeokuta in Yoruba a manwill send a symbolical letter in the shape of cowries, palm-nutsand other kernels strung on rice- straw, and sharp wits readilyinterpret the meaning. A specimen is given in p. 262 of MissTucker's "Abbeokuta; or Sunrise within the Tropics."[FN#490] Mr. Payne (ii. 227) translates "Hawa al-'Urzi" by "thelove of the Beni Udhra, an Arabian tribe famous for the passion anddevotion with which love was practiced among them." See Nightdclxxxiii. I understand it as "excusable love" which, for want ofa better term, is here translated "platonic." It is, however, morelike the old "bundling" of Wales and Northern England; and allowsall the pleasures but one, the toyings which the French call lesplaisirs de la petite ode; a term my dear old friend Fred. Hankeyderived from la petite voie. The Afghans know it as "Namzad-bazi"or betrothed play (Pilgrimage, ii. 56); the Abyssinians as eye-love; and the Kafirs as Slambuka a Shlabonka, for which see Thetraveller Delegorgue.[FN#491] "Turk" in Arabic and Persian poetry means a plunderer, arobber. Thus Hafiz: "Agar an Turk-i-Shirazi ba-dast arad dil-i-mara," If that Shirazi (ah, the Turk!) would deign to take my heartin hand, etc.[FN#492] Arab. "Nazir," a steward or an eye (a "looker"). The ideais borrowed from Al-Hariri (Assemblies, xiii.), and,--[FN#493] Arab. "Hajib," a groom of the chambers, a chamberlain;also an eyebrow. See Al-Hariri, ibid. xiii. and xxii.[FN#494] This gesture speaks for itself: it is that of a dyerstaining a cloth. The "Sabbagh's" shop is the usual small recess,open to the street and showing pans of various dyes sunk like "dog-laps" in the floor.[FN#495] The Arab. "Sabt" (from sabata, he kept Sabt) and the Heb."Sabbath" both mean Saturn's day, Saturday, transferred by someunknown process throughout Christendom to Sunday. The change is oneof the most curious in the history of religions. If there be asingle command stronger than all others it is "Keep the Saturdayholy." It was so kept by the Founder of Christianity; the order wasnever abrogated and yet most Christians are not aware that Sabbath,or "Sawbath," means Saturn's day, the "Shiyar" of the older Arabs.And to complete its degradation "Sabbat" in French and German meansa criaillerie, a "row," a disorder, an abominable festival of Hexen(witches). This monstrous absurdity can be explained only byaberrations of sectarian zeal, of party spirit in religion.[FN#496] The men who cry to prayer. The first was Bilal, theAbyssinian slave bought and manumitted by Abu Bakr. His simple crywas "I testify there is no Ilah (god) but Allah (God)! Come ye toprayers!" Caliph Omar, with the Prophet's permission, added, "Itestify that Mohammed is the Apostle of Allah." The prayer-crywhich is beautiful and human, contrasting pleasantly with thebrazen clang of the bell. now is     Allah is Almighty (bis).     I declare no god is there but Allah (bis).     Hie ye to Rogation (Hayya=halumma).     Hie ye to Salvation (Falah=prosperity, Paradise).     ("Hie ye to Edification," a Shi'ah adjunct).     Prayer is better than sleep (in the morning, also bis).     No god is there but AllahThis prayer call is similarly worded and differently pronounced andintoned throughout Al-Islam.[FN#497] i.e. a graceful youth of Al-Hijaz, the Moslem Holy Land,whose "sons" claim especial privileges.[FN#498] Arab. "harf'= a letter, as we should say a syllable.[FN#499] She uses the masculine "fata," in order to make thequestion more mysterious.[FN#500] The fountain-bowl is often ornamented by a rude mosaic ofblack and white marble with enlivenments of red stone or tile incomplicated patterns.[FN#501] Arab. "Kubad" = shaddock (citrus decumana): the hugeorange which Captain Shaddock brought from the West Indies; it isthe Anglo-Indian pompelmoose, vulg. pummelo. An excellent bitter ismade out of the rind steeped in spirits. Citronworts came fromIndia whence they spread throughout the tropics: they were firstintroduced into Europe by the heroic Joam de Castro and planted inhis garden at Cintra where their descendants are still seen.[FN#502] Arab. "Baklawah," Turk. "Baklava," a kind of pastry withblanched almonds bruised small between layers of dough, baked inthe oven and cut into lozenges. It is still common[FN#503] Her just fear was that the young woman might prove "tooclever by half" for her simpleton cousin.[FN#504] The curse is pregnant with meaning. On Judgment-day therighteous shall arise with their faces shining gloriously: hencethe blessing, "Bayyaz' Allaho wajh-ak" (=Allah whiten thycountenance!). But the wicked shall appear with faces scorchedblack and deformed by horror (Koran xxiv.): hence "God blacken thybrow!" I may observe that Easterns curse, the curse beingeverywhere the language of excited destructiveness; but onlyWesterns, and these chiefly English, swear, a practice utterlymeaningless. "Damn it" without specifying what the "it" is, soundslike the speech of a naughty child anxious only to use a "wickedword." "Damn you!" is intelligible all the world over. It has givenrise to "les goddams" in France, "Godames" in the Brazil and"Gotama" amongst the Somal of Eastern Africa, who learn it in Aden,[FN#505] Arab. "Zardah," usually rice dressed with saffron andhoney, from Pers. "Zard," saffron, yellow. See Night dcxii.[FN#506] Vulgarly called "knuckle-bone," concerning which I shallhave something to say.[FN#507] A bit of wood used in the children's game called "Tab"which resembles our tip-cat (Lane M. E. chaps. xvii.).[FN#508] Arab. "Balah," the unripened date, which is considered alaxative and eaten in hot weather.[FN#509] Lane (i. 611), quoting Al-Kazwini, notes that the date-stone is called "Nawa" (dim. "Nawayah") which also means distance,absence, severance. Thus the lady threatens to cast off her greedyand sleepy lover.[FN#510] The pad of the carob-bean which changes little after beingplucked is an emblem of constancy.[FN#511] This dirham=48 grains avoir.[FN#512] The weight would be round: also "Hadid" (=iron) meanssharp or piercing (Koran chaps. Vi]. 21). The double "swear" isintended to be very serious. Moreover iron conjures away fiends:when a water-spout or a sand-devil (called Shaytan also in Arabia)approaches, you point the index at the Jinn and say, "Iron, O thouill-omened one!" Amongst the Ancient Egyptians the metal was ill-omened being the bones of Typhon, 80 here, possibly, we have aninstance of early homoeopathy--similia similibus.[FN#513] Probably fermented to a kind of wine. The insipid fruit(Unnab) which looks like an apple in miniature, is much used instews, etc. It is the fruit (Nabak classically Nabik) of RhamnusNabeca (or Sidrat) also termed Zizyphus Jujuba, seu Spina Christibecause fabled to have formed the crown of thorns: in the Englishmarket this plum is called Chinese Japonica. I have described it inPilgrimage ii. 205, and have noticed the infusion of the leaves forwashing the dead (ibid. ii. 105): this is especially the use of the"Ber" in India, where the leaves are superstitiously heldpeculiarly pure. Our dictionaries translate "Sidr" by "Lote-tree";and no wonder that believers in Homeric writ feel their bilearoused by so poor a realisation of the glorious myth. The Homeridsprobably alluded to Hashish or Bhang.[FN#514] Arab. "Azrar": the open collar of the Saub ("Tobe") orlong loose dress is symptomatic. The Eastern button is on the sameprinciple as ours (both having taken the place of the classicalfibula); but the Moslem affects a loop (like those to which weattach our "frogs") and utterly ignores a button-hole.[FN#515] Alluding to the ceremonious circumambulation of the HolyHouse at Meccah: a notable irreverence worthy of Kneph-town(Canopus).[FN#516] The ear-drop is the penis and the anklet its crown ofglory.[FN#517] Equivalent to our "Alas! Alas!" which, by the by, no oneever says. "Awah," like "Yauh," is now a woman's word although usedby Al-Hariri (Assembly of Basrah) and so Al-awwah=one who criesfrom grief "Awah." A favourite conversational form is "Yehh" withthe aspirate exasperated, but it is an expression of astonishmentrather than sorrow. It enters into Europe travel-books. [FN#518] In the text "burst her gall-bladder."[FN#519] The death of Azizah is told with true Arab pathos andsimplicity: it still draws tear. *from the eyes of the Badawi, andI never read it without a "lump in the throat."[FN#520] Arab. "Inshallah bukra!" a universal saying which is thehorror of travellers.[FN#521] I have explained "Nu'uman's flower" as the anemone whichin Grecised Arabic is "Anumiya." Here they are strewed over thetomb; often the flowers are planted in a small bed of mould sunk inthe upper surface.[FN#522] Arab. "Barzakh" lit. a bar, a partition: in the Koran(chapts. xxiii. and xxxv.) the space or the place between death andresurrection where souls are stowed away. It corresponds after afashion with the classical Hades and the Limbus (Limbo) ofChristendom, e.g.. Limbus patrum, infantum, fatuorum. But it mustnot be confounded with Al-A'araf, The Moslem purgatory.[FN#523] Arab. "Zukak al-Nakib," the latter word has been explainedas a chief, leader, head man.[FN#524] Moslems never stand up at such times, for a spray of urinewould make their clothes ceremonially impure: hence the scrupulouswill break up with stick or knife the hard ground in front of them.A certain pilgrim was reported to have made this blunder which ishardly possible in Moslem dress. A high personage once asked me ifit was true that he killed a man who caught him in a standingposition; and I found to my surprise that the absurd scandal wasalready twenty years old. After urinating the Moslem wipes the ospenis with one to three bits of stone, clay or handfuls of earth,and he must perform Wuzu before he can pray. Tournefort (Voyage auLevant iii. 335) tells a pleasant story of certain Christians atConstantinople who powdered with "Poivre-d'Inde" the stones in awall where the Moslems were in the habit of rubbing the os penis byway of wiping The same author (ii. 336) strongly recommends atranslation of Rabelais' Torcheculative chapter (Lib i., chaps. 13)for the benefit of Mohammedans.[FN#525] Arab. "Nuhas ahmar," lit. red brass.[FN#526] The cup is that between the lady's legs.[FN#527] A play upon "Sak" = calf, or leg, and "Saki," a cup-bearer. The going round (Tawaf) and the running (Sa'i) allude tothe circumambulation of the Ka'abah, and the running between MountSafa and Marwah (Pilgrimage ii. 58, and iii. 343). A religiousMoslem would hold the allusion highly irreverent.[FN#528] Lane (i. 614) never saw a woman wearing such kerchiefwhich is deshabille. It is either spread over the head or twistedturband-wise.[FN#529] The "Kasabah" was about two fathoms of long measure, andsometimes 12 « feet; but the length has been reduced.[FN#530] "Bat and ball," or hockey on horseback (Polo) is one ofthe earliest Persian games as shown by every illustrated copy ofFirdausi's "Shahnameh." This game was played with a Kurrah or smallhand-ball and a long thin bat crooked at the end called in PersianChaugan and in Arabic Saulajan. Another sense of the word is givenin the Burhan-i-Kati translated by Vullers (Lex. Persico-Latinum),a large bandy with bent head to which is hung an iron ball, alsocalled Kaukabah (our "morning-star") and like the umbrella itdenotes the grandees of the court. The same Kaukabah particularlydistinguished one of the Marquesses of Waterford. This Polocorresponds with the folliculus, the pallone, the baloun-game(moyen age) of Europe, where the horse is not such a companion ofman; and whereof the classics sang:--     Folle decet pueros ludere, folle senes.In these days we should spell otherwise the "folle" of seniorsplaying at the ball or lawn-tennis.[FN#531] "Dalil" means a guide; `'Dalilah," a woman who misguides,a bawd. See the Tale of Dalilah the Crafty, Night dcxcviii.[FN#532] i.e. she was a martyr.[FN#533] Arab. "Ghashim" a popular and insulting term, our "JohnnyRaw." Its use is shown in Pilgrimage i. 110.[FN#534] Bathers pay on leaving the Hammam; all enter withoutpaying.[FN#535] i.e. she swore him upon his sword and upon the Koran: aloaf of bread is sometimes added.

Now Al-Fazl was the most generous of the people ofhis age, upright of life, so that all hearts united in loving himand the wise flocked to him for counsel; whilst the subjects usedto pray for his long life, because he was a compendium of thebest qualities, encouraging the good and lief, and preventingevil and mischief.  But the Wazir Mu'ín bin Sáwí on the contraryhated folk [FN#4] and loved not the good and was a mere compoundof ill; even as was said of him,"Hold to nobles, sons of nobles! 'tis ever Nature's test  * That     nobles born of nobles shall excel in noble deed:And shun the mean of soul, meanly bred, for 'tis the law, *  Mean     deeds come of men who are mean of blood and breed."And as much as the people loved and fondly loved Al-Fazl binKhákán, so they hated and thoroughly hated the mean and miserlyMu'ín bin Sáwí. It befel one day by the decree of the Decreer,that King Mohammed bin Sulayman al-Zayni, being seated on histhrone with his officers of state about him, summoned his WazirAl-Fazl and said to him, "I wish to have a slave-girl of passingbeauty, perfect in loveliness, exquisite in symmetry and endowedwith all praiseworthy gifts."  Said the courtiers, "Such a girlis not to be bought for less than ten thousand gold pieces:"whereupon the Sultan called out to his treasurer and said, "Carryten thousand dinars to the house of Al-Fazl bin Khákán." Thetreasurer did the King's bidding; and the Minister went away,after receiving the royal charge to repair to the slave-bazarevery day, and entrust to brokers the matter aforesaid.  Moreoverthe King issued orders that girls worth above a thousand goldpieces should not be bought or sold without being first displayedto the Wazir.  Accordingly no broker purchased a slave-girl ereshe had been paraded before the minister; but none pleased him,till one day a dealer came to the house and found him takinghorse and intending for the palace.  So he caught hold of hisstirrup saying,"O thou, who givest to royal state sweet savour, * Thou'rt a     Wazir shalt never fail of favour!Dead Bounty thou hast raised to life for men;  * Ne'er fail of     Allah's grace such high endeavour!"Then quoth he, "O my lord, that surpassing object for whom thegracious mandate was issued is at last found; [FN#5]" and quoththe Wazir, "Here with her to me!"  So he went away and returnedafter a little, bringing a damsel in richest raiment robed, amaid spear-straight of stature and five feet tall; budding ofbosom with eyes large and black as by Kohl traced, and dewy lipssweeter than syrup or the sherbet one sips, a virginette smoothcheeked and shapely faced, whose slender waist with massive hipswas engraced; a form more pleasing than branchlet waving upon thetop-most trees, and a voice softer and gentler than the morningbreeze, even as saith one of those who have described her,"Strange is the charm which dights her brows like Luna's disk     that shine; * O sweeter taste than sweetest Robb[FN#6] or     raisins of the vine.A throne th'Empyrean keeps for her in high and glorious state, *     For wit and wisdom, wandlike form and graceful bending line:She in the Heaven of her face[FN#7] the seven-fold stars     displays, * That guard her cheeks as satellites against     the spy's design:If man should cast a furtive glance or steal far look at her, *     His heart is burnt by devil-bolts shot by those piercing     eyne."When the Wazir saw her she made him marvel with excess ofadmiration, so he turned, perfectly pleased, to the broker andasked, "What is the price of this girl?"; whereto he answered,"Her market-value stands at ten thousand dinars, but her ownerswears that this sum will not cover the cost of the chickens shehath eaten, the wine she hath drunken and the dresses of honourbestowed upon her instructor: for she hath learned calligraphyand syntax and etymology; the commentaries of the Koran; theprinciples of law and religion; the canons of medicine, and thecalendar and the art of playing on musical instruments."[FN#8]Said the Wazir, "Bring me her master."  So the broker brought himat once and, behold, he was a Persian of whom there was left onlywhat the days had left; for he was as a vulture bald and scaldand a wall trembling to its fall.  Time had buffetted him withsore smart, yet was he not willing this world to depart; even assaid the poet,"Time hath shattered all my frame, *  Oh! how time hath     shattered me.Time with lordly might can tame    * Manly strength and vigour     free.Time was in my youth, that none    * Sped their way more fleet         and fast:Time is and my strength is gone,   * Youth is sped, and speed     is past.[FN#9]"The Wazir asked him, "Art thou content to sell this slave-girl tothe Sultan for ten thousand dinars?"; and the Persian answered,"By Allah, if I offer her to the King for naught, it were but mydevoir."[FN#10] So the Minister bade bring the monies and sawthem weighed out to the Persian, who stood up before him andsaid, "By the leave of our lord the Wazir, I have somewhat tosay;" and the Wazir replied, "Out with all thou hast!"  "It is myopinion," continued the slave-dealer, "that thou shouldst notcarry the maid to the King this day; for she is newly off ajourney; the change of air[FN#11] hath affected her and the toilsof trouble have fretted her.  But keep her quiet in thy palacesome ten days, that she may recover her looks and become again asshe was.  Then send her to the Hammam and clothe her in therichest of clothes and go up with her to the Sultan: this will bemore to thy profit."  The Wazir pondered the Persian's words andapproved of their wisdom; so he carried her to his palace, wherehe appointed her private rooms, and allowed her every daywhatever she wanted of meat and drink and so forth.  And on thiswise she abode a while.  Now the Wazir Al-Fazl had a son like thefull moon when sheeniest dight, with face radiant in light,cheeks ruddy bright, and a mole like a dot of ambergris on adowny site; as said of him the poet and said full right,"A moon which blights you[FN#12] if you dare behold; * A branch     which folds you in its waving fold:Locks of the Zanj[FN#13] and golden glint of hair; * Sweet gait     and form a spear to have and hold:Ah! hard of heart with softest slenderest waist, * That evil to     this weal why not remould?[FN#14]Were thy form's softness placed in thy heart, * Ne'er would thy     lover find thee harsh and cold:Oh thou accuser! be my love's excuser, * Nor chide if love-pangs     deal me woes untold!I bear no blame: 'tis all my hear and eyne; * So leave thy     blaming, let me yearn and pine."Now the handsome youth knew not the affair of the damsel; and hisfather had enjoined her closely, saying, "Know, O my daughter,that I have bought thee as a bedfellow for our King, Mohammed binSulayman al-Zayni; and I have a son who is a Satan for girls andleaves no maid in the neighbourhood without taking hermaidenhead; so be on thy guard against him and beware of lettinghim see thy face or hear they voice." "Hearkening and obedience,"said the girl; and he left her and fared forth.  Some days afterthis it happened by decree of Destiny, that the damsel repairedto the baths in the house, where some of the slave women bathedher; after which she arrayed herself in sumptuous raiment; andher beauty and loveliness were thereby redoubled.  Then she wentin to the Wazir's wife and kissed her hand; and the dame said toher, "Naiman!  May it benefit thee,[FN#15] O Anis al-Jalis![FN#16]  Are not our baths handsome?"  "O my mistress," shereplied, "I lacked naught there save thy gracious presence." Thereupon the lady said to her slave-women, "Come with us to theHammam, for it is some days since we went there:" they answered,"To hear is to obey!" and rose and all accompanied her. Now shehad set two little slave-girls to keep the door of the privatechamber wherein was Anis al-Jalis and had said to them, "Suffernone go in to the damsel."  Presently, as the beautiful maidensat resting in her rooms, suddenly came in the Wazir's son whosename was Nur al-Din Ali,[FN#17] and asked after his mother andher women, to which the two little slave-girls replied, "They arein the Hammam."  But the damsel, Anis al-Jalis, had heard fromwithin Nur al-Din Ali's voice and had said to herself, "O wouldHeaven I saw what like is this youth against whom the Wazirwarned me, saying that he hath not left a virgin in theneighbourhood without taking her virginity: by Allah, I do longto have sight of him!"  So she sprang to her feet with thefreshness of the bath on her and, stepping to the door, looked atNur al-Din Ali and saw a youth like the moon in its full and thesight bequeathed her a thousand sighs. The young man also glancedat her and the look make him heir to a thousand thoughts of care;and each fell into Love's ready snare.  Then he stepped up to thetwo little slave-girls and cried aloud at them; whereupon bothfled before him and stood afar off to see what he would do.  Andbehold, he walked to the door of the damsel's chamber and,opening it, went in and asked her "Art thou she my father boughtfor me?" and she answered "Yes." Thereupon the youth, who waswarm with wine, came up to her and embraced her; then he took herlegs and passed them round his waist and she wound her arms abouthis neck, and met him with kisses and murmurs of pleasure andamorous toyings.  Next he sucked her tongue and she sucked his,and lastly, he loosed the strings of her petticoat-trousers andabated her maidenhead.  When the two little slave-girls saw theiryoung master get in unto the damsel, Anis al-Jalis, they criedout and shrieked; so as soon as the youth had had his wicked willof her, he rose and fled forth fearing the consequences of hisill-doing.  When the Wazir's wife heard the slave-girls' cries,she sprang up and came out of the baths with the perspirationpouring from her face, saying, "What is this unseemly clamour inthe house[FN#18]?"  Then she came up to the two little slave-girls and asked them saying, "Fie upon you! what is the matter?";and both answered, "Verily our lord Nur al-Din came in and beatus, so we fled; then he went up to Anis al-Jalis and threw hisarms round her and we know not what he did after that; but whenwe cried out to thee he ran away."  Upon this the lady went toAnis al-Jalis and said to her, "What tidings?"  "O my lady," sheanswered, "as I was sitting here lo! a handsome young man came inand said to me:--Art thou she my father bought for me?; and Ianswered Yes; for, by Allah, O mistress mine, I believed that hiswords were true; and he instantly came in and embraced me."  "Didhe nought else with thee but this?" quoth the lady, and quothshe, "Indeed he did!  But he did it only three times." "He didnot leave thee without dishonouring thee!" cried the Wazir's wifeand fell to weeping and buffetting her face, she and the girl andall the handmaidens, fearing lest Nur al-Din's father should killhim.[FN#19]  Whilst they were thus, in came the Wazir and askedwhat was the matter, and his wife said to him, "Swear that whatsoI tell thee thou wilt attend to it."  "I will," answered he.  Soshe related to him what his son had done, whereat he was muchconcerned and rent his raiment and smote his face till his nosebled, and plucked out his beard by the handful. "Do not killthyself," said his wife, "I will give thee ten thousand dinars,her price, of my own money."  But he raised his head and cried,"Out upon thee!  I have no need of her purchase-money: my fear islest life as well as money go."  "O my lord, and how is that?" "Wottest thou not that yonder standeth our enemy Al Mu'ín binSáwí who, as soon as he shall hear of this matter, will go up tothe Sultan"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceasedsaying her permitted say.              When it was the Thirty-fifth Night,She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that theWazir said to his wife, "Wottest thou not that yonder standethour enemy Al-Mu'ín bin Sáwí who, as soon as he hears of thismatter will go up to the Sultan and say to him, 'Thy Wazir who,thou wilt have it loveth thee, took from thee ten thousand ducatsand bought therewith a slave-girl whose like none ever beheld;but when he saw her, she pleased him and he said to his son,'Take her: thou art worthier of her than the Sultan.'  So he tookher and did away with her virginity and she is now in his house.' The King will say, 'Thou liest!' to which he will reply, 'Withthy leave I will fall upon him unawares and bring her to thee.' The King will give him warranty for this and he will come downupon the house and will take the girl and present her to theSultan, who will question her and she will not be able to denythe past.  Then mine enemy will say, 'O my lord, thou wottestthat I give thee the best of counsel; but I have not found favourin thine eyes.'  Thereupon the Sultan will make an example of me,and I shall be a gazing-stock to all the people and my life willbe lost."  Quoth his wife, "Let none know of this thing whichhath happened privily, and commit thy case to Allah and trust inHim to save thee from such strait; for He who knoweth the futureshall provide for the future."  With this she brought the Wazir acup of wine and his heart was quieted, and he ceased to feelwrath and fear.  Thus far concerning him; but as regards his sonNur al-Din Ali, fearing the consequence of his misdeed he abodehis day long in the flower garden and came back only at night tohis mother's apartment where he slept; and, rising before dawn,returned to the gardens.  He ceased not to do thus for two wholemonths without showing his face to his parent, till at last hismother said to his father, "O my lord, shall we lose our boy aswell as the girl?  If matters continue long in this way he willflee from us."  "And what to do?" asked he; and she answered, "Dothou watch this night; and, when he cometh, seize on him andfrighten him: I will rescue him from thee and do thou make peacewith him and give him the damsel to wife, for she loveth him ashe loveth her.  And I will pay thee her price." So the Ministersay up that night and, when his son came, he seized him andthrowing him down knelt on his breast and showed as thou he wouldcut his throat; but his mother ran to the youth's succour andasked her husband, "What wouldest thou do with him?"  He answeredher, "I will split his weasand."  Said the son to the father, "Ismy death, then, so light a matter to thee?"; and his father'seyes welled with tears, for natural affection moved him, and herejoined, "O my son, how light was to thee the loss of my goodand my life!"  Quoth Nur al-Din, "Hear, O my father, what thepoet hath said,‘Forgive me! thee-ward sinned I, but the wise * Ne'er to the     sinner shall deny his grace:Thy foe may pardon sue when lieth he * In lowest, and thou     holdest highest place!'"Thereupon the Wazir rose from off his son's breast saying, "Iforgive thee!"; for his heart yearned to him; and the youthkissed the hand of his sire who said, "O my son, were I sure thatthou wouldest deal justly by Anis al-Jalis, I would give her tothee."  "O my father, what justice am I to do to her?"  "I enjointhee, O my son, not to take another wife or concubine to sharewith her, nor sell her."  "O my father! I swear to thee thatverily I will not do her injustice in either way."  Having swornto that effect Nur al-Din went in to the damsel and abode withher a whole year, whilst Allah Almighty caused the King to forgetthe matter of the maiden; and Al-Mu'ín, though the affair came tohis ears, dared not divulge it by reason of the high favour inwhich his rival stood with the Sultan.  At the end of the yearAl-Fazl went one day to the public baths; and, as he came outwhilst he was still sweating, the air struck him[FN#20] and hecaught a cold which turned to a fever; then he took to his bed. His malady gained ground and restlessness was longsome upon himand weakness bound him like a chain; so he called out, "Hitherwith my son;" and when Nur al-Din Ali came he said to him, "O myson, know that man's lot and means are distributed and decreed;and the end of days by all must be dree'd; and that every souldrain the cup of death is nature's need."  The he repeated theselines,"I die my death, but He alone is great who dieth not! * And well     I wot, soon shall I die, for death was made my lot:A King there's not that dies and holds his kingdom in his hand, *     For Sovranty the Kingdom is of Him who dieth not."Then he continued, "O my son, I have no charge to leave thee savethat thou fear Allah and look to the issues of thine acts andbear in mind my injunctions anent Anis al-Jalis."  "O my father!"said Nur al-Din, "who is like unto thee?  Indeed thou art famedfor well doing and preachers offer prayers for thee in theirpulpits!"  Quoth Al-Fazl, "O my son, I hope that Allah Almightymay grant me acceptance!"  Then he pronounced the TwoTestimonies,[FN#21] or Professions of the Faith, and was recordedamong the blessed.  The palace was filled with crying andlamentation and the news of his death reached the King, and thecity-people wept, even those at their prayers and women athousehold cares and the school-children shed tears for Bin-Khákán.  Then his son Nur al-Din Ali arose and made ready hisfuneral, and the Emirs and Wazirs and high Officers of State andcity-notables were present, amongst them the Wazir al-Mu'ín binSáwí.  And as the bier went forth from the house some one in thecrowd of mourners began to chant these lines,"On the fifth day I quitted al my friends for evermore, * And     they laid me out and washed me on a slab without my     door:[FN#22]They stripped me of the clothes I was ever wont to wear, * And     they clothed me in the clothes which till then I never wore.On four men's necks they bore me and carried me from home * To     chapel; and some prayed for him on neck they bore:They prayed for me a prayer that no prostration knows;[FN#23] *     They prayed for me who praised me and were my friends of     yore;And they laid me in a house with a ceiling vaulted o'er, * And     Time shall be no more ere it ope to me its door."When they had shovelled in the dust over him and the crowd haddispersed, Nur al-Din returned home and he lamented with sobs andtears; and the tongue of the case repeated these couplets,"On the fifth day at even-tide they went away from me: *      farewelled them as faring they made farewell my lot:But my spirit as they went, with them went and so I cried, * 'Ah     return ye!' but replied she, 'Alas! return is notTo a framework lere and lorn that lacketh blood and life, * A     frame whereof remaineth naught but bones that rattle and     rot:Mine eyes are blind and cannot see quencht by the flowing tear! *     Mine ears are dull and lost to sense: they have no power to     hear!'"He abode a long time sorrowing for his father till, one day, ashe was sitting at home, there came a knocking at the door; so herose in haste and opening let in a man, one of his father'sintimates and who had been the Wazir's boon-companion.  Thevisitor kissed Nur al-Din's hand and said to him, "O my lord, hewho hath left the like of thee is not dead; and this way wentalso the Chief of the Ancients and the Moderns. [FN#24] O my lordAli, be comforted and leave sorrowing."  Thereupon Nur al-Dinrose and going to the guest-saloon transported thither all heneeded. Then he assembled his companions and took his handmaidagain; and, collecting round him ten of the sons of themerchants, began to eat meat and drink wine, giving entertainmentafter entertainment and lavishing his presents and his favours. One day his Steward came to him and said, "O my lord Nur al-Din,hast thou not heard the saying, Whoso spendeth and reckoneth not,to poverty wendeth and recketh not?"  And he repeated what thepoet wrote,"I look to my money and keep it with care, * For right well I wot     'tis my buckler and brand:Did I lavish my dirhams on hostilest foes,[FN#25] * I should     truck my good luck by mine ill luck trepanned:So I'll eat it and drink it and joy in my wealth; * And no     spending my pennies on others I'll stand:I will keep my purse close 'gainst whoever he be; * And a niggard     in grain a true friend ne'er I fand:Far better deny him than come to say:--Lend, * And five-fold the     loan shall return to thy hand!And he turns face aside and he sidles away, * While I stand like     a dog disappointed, unmanned,Oh, the sorry lot his who hath yellow-boys none, * Though his     genius and virtues shine bright as the sun!O my master," continued the Steward, "this lavish outlay andthese magnificent gifts waste away wealth."  When Nur al-Din Aliheard these words he looked at his servant and cried, "Of allthou hast spoken I will not heed one single word, for I haveheard the saying of the poet who saith,'An my palm be full of wealth and my wealth I ne'er bestow, * A     palsy take my hand and my foot ne'er rise again!Show my niggard who by niggardise e'er rose to high degree, * Or     the generous gifts generally hath slain.'"And he pursued, "Know, O Steward, it is my desire that so long asthou hast money enough for my breakfast, thou trouble me not withtaking thought about my supper."  Thereupon the Steward asked,"Must it be so?"; and he answered, "It must."  So the honest manwent his way and Nur al-Din Ali devoted himself to extravagance;and, if any of his cup-companions chanced to say, "This is apretty thing;" he would reply, "'Tis a gift to thee!"; or ifanother said, "O my lord, such a house is handsome;" he wouldanswer, "Take it: it is thine!"  After this reckless fashion hecontinued to live for a whole year, giving his friends a banquetin the morning and a banquet in the evening and a banquet atmidnight, till one day, as the company was sitting together, thedamsel Anis al-Jalis repeated these lines,"Thou deemedst well of Time when days went well, * And feardest     not what ills might deal thee Fate:Thy nights so fair and restful cozened thee, *  For peaceful     nights bring woes of heavy weight."When she had ended her verse behold, somebody knocked at thedoor. So Nur al-Din rose to open it and one of his boon-companions followed him without being perceived.  At the door hefound his Steward and asked him, "What is the matter?"; and heanswered, "O my lord, what I dreaded for thee hath come to pass!" "How so?"  "Know that there remains not a dirham's worth, less ormore in my hands.  Here are my Daftars and account books showingboth income and outlay and the registers of thine originalproperty."  When Nur al-Din heard these words he bowed his headand said, "There is no Majesty and there is no Might save inAllah!"  When the man who had followed him privily to spy on himheard the Steward's words, he returned to his friends and warnedthem saying, "Look ye well to what ye do: Nur al-Din ispenniless;" and, as the young host came back to his guests,vexation showed itself in his face.  Thereupon one of theintimates rose; and, looking at the entertainer, said to him, "Omy lord, may be thou wilt give me leave to retire?"  "And why soearly retirement this day?"; asked he and the other answered him,"My wife is in childbirth and I may not be absent from her:indeed I must return and see how she does."  So he gave himleave, whereupon another rose and said, "O my lord Nur al-Din, Iwish now to go to my brother's for he circumciseth his son to-day."[FN#26]  In short each and every asked permission to retireon some pretence or other, till all the ten were gone leaving Nural-Din alone.  Then he called his slave-girl and said to her, "OAnis al-Jalis, hast thou seen what case is mine?"  And he relatedto her what the Steward had told him.  Then quoth she, "O mylord, for many nights I had it in my mind to speak with thee ofthis matter, but I heard thee repeating,'When the World heaps favours on thee, pass on * Thy favours to     friends ere her hand she stay:Largesse never let her when fain she comes, * Nor niggardise kept     her from turning away!'When I heard these verses I held my peace and cared not toexchange a word with thee."  "O Anis al-Jalis," said Nur al-Din,"thou knowest that I have not wasted my wealth save on myfriends, especially these ten who have now left me a pauper, andI think they will not abandon and desert me without relief."  "ByAllah," replied she, "they will not profit thee with aught ofaid."  Said he, "I will rise at once and go to them and knock attheir doors; it may be I shall get from them somewhat wherewith Imay trade and leave pastime and pleasuring."  So he rose withoutstay or delay, and repaired to a street wherein all his tenfriends lived.  He went up to the nearest door and knocked;whereupon a handmaid came out and asked him, "Who art thou?"; andhe answered, "Tell thy master that Nur al-Din Ali standeth at thedoor and saith to him, 'Thy slave kisseth thy hand and awaiteththy bounty.'"  The girl went in and told her master, who cried ather, "Go back and say, 'My master is not at home.'"  So shereturned to Nur al-Din, and said to him, "O my lord, my master isout."  Thereupon he turned away and said to himself, "If this onebe a whoreson knave and deny himself, another may not provehimself such knave and whoreson."  Then he went up to the nextdoor and sent in a like message to the house-master, who deniedhimself as the first had done, whereupon he began repeating,"He is gone who when to his gate thou go'st, * Fed thy famisht     maw with his boiled and roast."When he had ended his verse he said, "By Allah, there is no helpbut that I make trial of them all: perchance there be one amongstthem who will stand me in the stead of all the rest."  So he wentthe round of the ten, but not one of them would open his door tohim or show himself or even break a bit of bread before him;whereupon he recited,"Like a tree is he who in wealth doth wone, * And while fruits he     the folk to his fruit shall run:But when bared the tree of what fruit it bare, * They leave it to     suffer from dust and sun.Perdition to all of this age!  I find * Ten rogues for every     righteous one."Then he returned to his slave-girl and his grief had grown moregrievous and she said to him, "O my lord, did I not tell thee,none would profit thee with aught of aid?"  And he replied, "ByAllah, not one of them would show me his face or know me!"  "O mylord," quoth she, "sell some of the moveables and householdstuff, such as pots and pans, little by little; and expend theproceeds until Allah Almighty shall provide."  So he sold all ofthat was in the house till nothing remained when he turned toAnis al-Jalis and asked her "What shall we do now?"; and sheanswered, "O my lord, it is my advice that thou rise forthwithand take me down to the bazar and sell me.  Thou knowest thatthey father bought me for ten thousand dinars: haply Allah mayopen thee a way to get the same price, and if it be His will tobring us once more together, we shall meet again."  "O Anis al-Jalis," cried he, "by Allah it is no light matter for me to beparted from thee for a single hour!"  "By Allah, O my lord," shereplied, "nor is it easy to me either, but Need hath its own law,as the poet said,'Need drives a man into devious roads, * And pathways doubtful of     trend and scope:No man to a rope[FN#27] will entrust his weight, * Save for cause     that calleth for case of rope.'"Thereupon he rose to his feet and took her,[FN#28] whilst thetears rolled down his cheek like rain; and he recited with thetongue of the case these lines,"Stay! grant one parting look before we part, * Nerving my heart     this severance to sustain:But, an this parting deal thee pain and bane, * Leave me to die     of love and spare thee pain!"Then he went down with her to the bazar and delivered her to thebroker and said to him, "O Hajj Hasan,[FN#29] I pray thee notethe value of her thou hast to cry for sale."  "O my lord Nur al-Din," quoth the broker, "the fundamentals are remembered;"[FN#30]adding, "Is not this the Anis al-Jalis whom thy father bought ofme for ten thousand dinars?" "Yes," said Nur al-Din.  Thereuponthe broker went round to the merchants, but found that all hadnot yet assembled.  So he waited till the rest had arrived andthe market was crowded with slave-girls of all nations, Turks,Franks and Circassians; Abyssinians, Nubians and Takruris;[FN#31]Tartars, Georgians and others; when he came forward and standingcried aloud, "O merchants! O men of money! every round thing isnot a walnut and every long thing a banana is not; all reds arenot meat nor all whites fat, nor is every brown thing adate![FN#32]  O merchants, I have here this union-pearl that hathno price: at what sum shall I cry her?" "Cry her at four thousandfive hundred dinars," quoth one of the traders. The broker openedthe door of sale at the sum named and, as he was yet calling, lo!the Wazir Al-Mu'ín bin Sáwí passed through the bazar and, seeingNur al-Din Ali waiting at one side, said to himself, "Why isKhákán's son[FN#33] standing about here?  Hath this gallows-birdaught remaining wherewith to buy slave-girls?"  Then he lookedround and, seeing the broker calling out in the market with allthe merchants around him, said to himself, "I am sure that he ispenniless and hath brought hither the damsel Anis al-Jalis forsale;" adding, "O how cooling and grateful is this to my heart!" Then he called the crier, who came up and kissed the groundbefore him; and he said to him, "I want this slave-girl whom thouart calling for sale."  The broker dared not cross him, so heanswered, "O my lord, Bismillah! in Allah's name so be it;" andled forward the damsel and showed her to him.  She pleased himmuch whereat he asked, "O Hasan, what is bidden for this girl?"and he answered, "Four thousand five hundred dinars to open thedoor of sale." Quoth Al-Mu'ín, "Four thousand five hundred is MYbid."  When the merchants heard this, they held back and darednot bid another dirham, wotting what they did of the Wazir'styranny, violence and treachery. So Al-Mu'ín looked at the brokerand said to him, "Why stand still? Go and offer four thousanddinars for me and the five hundred shall be for thyself." Thereupon the broker went to Nur al-Din and said, "O my lord, thyslave is going for nothing!"  "And how so?" asked he. The brokeranswered, "We had opened the biddings for her at four thousandfive hundred dinars; when that tyrant, Al-Mu'ín bin Sáwí, passedthrough the bazar and, as he saw the damsel she pleased him, sohe cried to me, 'Call me the buyer at four thousand dinars andthou shalt have five hundred for thyself.'  I doubt not but thathe knoweth that the damsel if thine, and if he would pay theedown her price at once it were well; but I know his injustice andviolence; he will give thee a written order upon some of hisagents and will send after thee to say to them, 'Pay himnothing.'  So as often as though shalt go in quest of the cointhey will say, 'We'll pay thee presently!' and they will put theeoff day after day, and thou art proud of spirit; till at last,when they are wearied with thine importunity, they will say,'Show us the cheque.' Then, as soon as they have got hold of itthey will tear it up and so thou wilt lose the girl's price."When Nur al-Din heard this he looked at the broker and asked him,"How shall this matter be managed?"; and he answered, "I willgive thee a counsel which, if thou follow, it shall bring theecomplete satisfaction." "And what is that?" quoth Nur al-Din.Quoth the broker, "Come thou to me anon when I am standing in themiddle of the market and, taking the girl from my hand, give hera sound cuffing and say to her, 'Thou baggage, I have kept my vowand brought thee down to the slave-market, because I swore anoath that I would carry thee from home to the bazar, and makebrokers cry thee for sale.'  If thou do this, perhaps the devicewill impose upon the Wazir and the people, and they will believethat thou broughtest her not to the bazar, but for the quittanceof thine oath." He replied, "Such were the best way." Then thebroker left him and, returning into the midst of the market, tookthe damsel by the hand, and signed to the Wazir and said, "O mylord, here is her owner." With this up came Nur al-Din Ali and,snatching the girl from the broker's hand, cuffed her soundly andsaid to her, "Shame on thee, O thou baggage!  I have brought theeto the bazar for quittance of mine oath; now get thee home andthwart me no more as is thy wont.  Woe to thee! do I need thyprice, that I should sell thee? The furniture of my house wouldfetch thy value many times over!" When Al-Mu'ín saw this he saidto Nur al-Din, "Out on thee!  Hast thou anything left for sellingor buying?"  And he would have laid violent hands upon him, butthe merchants interposed (for they all loved Nur al-Din), and theyoung man said to them, "Here am I in your hands and ye all knowhis tyranny."  "By Allah," cried the Wazir, "but for you I hadslain him!"  Then all signed with significant eyes to Nur al-Dinas much as to say, "Take thy wreak of him; not one of us willcome between thee and him."  Thereupon Nur al-Din, who was stoutof heart as he was stalwart of limb, went up to the Wazir and,dragging him over the pommel of his saddle, threw him to theground.  Now there was in that place a puddling- pit for brick-clay,[FN#34] into the midst of which he fell, and Nur al-Din keptpummelling and fisti-cuffing him, and one of the blows fell fullon his teeth, and his beard was dyed with his blood.  Also therewere with the minister ten armed slaves who, seeing their masterentreated after this fashion, laid hand on sword-hilt and wouldhave bared blades and fallen on Nur al-Din to cut him down; butthe merchants and bystanders said to them, "This is a Wazir andthat is the son of a Wazir; haply they will make friends sometime or other, in which case you will forfeit the favour of both. Or perchance a blow may befal your lord, and you will all die thevilest of deaths; so it were better for you not to interfere."Accordingly they held aloof and, when Nur al-Din had made an endof thrashing the Wazir, he took his handmaid and fared homewards.Al-Mu'ín also went his ways at once, with his raiment dyed ofthree colours, black with mud, red with blood and ash colouredwith brick-clay. When he saw himself in this state, he bound abit of matting[FN#35] round his neck and, taking in hand twobundles of coarse Halfah-grass,[FN#36] went up to the palace andstanding under the Sultan's windows cried aloud, "O King of theage, I am a wronged man!  I am foully wronged!"  So they broughthim before the King who looked at him; and behold, it was thechief Minister; whereupon he said, "O Wazir who did this deed bythee?"  Al-Mu'ín wept and sobbed and repeated these lines,"Shall the World oppress me when thou art in't? * In the lion's     presence shall wolves devour?Shall the dry all drink of thy tanks and I * Under rain-cloud     thirst for the cooling shower?""O my lord," cried he, "the like will befal every one who lovethand serveth thee well."  "Be quick with thee," quoth the Sultan,"and tell me how this came to pass and who did this deed by onewhose honour is part of my honour."  Quoth the Wazir, "Know, O mylord, that I went out this day to the slave-market to buy me acookmaid, when I saw there a damsel, never in my life long saw Ia fairer; and I designed to buy her for our lord the Sultan; so Iasked the broker of her and of her owner, and he answered, "Shebelongeth to Ali son of Al-Fazl bin Khákán.  Some time ago ourlord the Sultan gave his father ten thousand dinars wherewith tobuy him a handsome slave-girl, and he bought this maiden whopleased him; so he grudged her to our lord the Sultan and gaveher to his own son. When the father died, the son sold all he hadof houses and gardens and household gear, and squandered theprice till he was penniless.  Then he brought the girl to themarket that he might sell her, and he handed her over to thebroker to cry and the merchants bid higher and higher on her,until the price reached four thousand dinars; whereupon quoth Ito myself, 'I will buy this damsel for our lord the Sultan, whosemoney was paid for her.'  So I said to Nur al-Din, 'O my son,sell her to me for four thousand dinars.'  When he heard my wordshe looked at me and cried, 'O ill-omened oldster, I will sell herto a Jew or to a Nazarene, but I will not sell her to thee!'  'Ido not buy her for myself,' said I, 'I buy her for our lord andbenefactor the Sultan.'  Hearing my words he was filled withrage; and, dragging me off my horse (and I a very old man), beatme unmercifully with his fists and buffeted me with his palmstill he left me as thou seest, and all this hath befallen me onlybecause I thought to buy this damsel for thee!"  Then the Wazirthrew himself on the ground and lay there weeping and shivering. When the Sultan saw his condition and heard his story, the veinof rage started out between his eyes[FN#37] and he turned to hisbody-guard who stood before him, forty white slaves, smiters withthe sword, and said to them, "Go down forthright to the housebuilt by the son of Khákán and sack it and raze it and bring tome his son Nur al-Din with the damsel; and drag them both ontheir faces with their arms pinioned behind them."  They replied,"To hear is to obey;" and, arming themselves, they set out forthe house of Nur al-Din Ali.  Now about the Sultan was aChamerlain, Alam[FN#38] al-Din Sanjar hight, who had aforetimebeen Mameluke to Al-Fazl; but he had risen in the world and theSultan had advanced him to be one of his Chamberlains.  When heheard the King's command and saw the enemies make them ready toslay his old master's son, it was grievous to him: so he went outfrom before the Sultan and, mounting his beast, rode to Nur al-Din's house and knocked at the door.  Nur al-Din came out andknowing him would have saluted him: but he said, "O my masterthis is no time for greeting or treating.  Listen to what thepoet said,  'Fly, fly with thy life if by ill overtaken!   Let thy house speak thy death by its builder forsaken!   For a land else than this land thou may'st reach, my brother,   But thy life tho'lt ne'er find in this world another.'"[FN#39]"O Alam al-Din what cheer?" asked Nur al-Din, and he answered,"Rise quickly and fly for thy life, thou and the damsel; for Al-Mu'ín hath set a snare for you both; and, if you fall into hishands, he will slay you.  The Sultan hath despatched fortysworders against you and I counsel you to flee ere harm can hurtyou."  Then Sanjar put his hand to his purse and finding thereforty gold pieces took them and gave them to Nur al-Din, saying,"O my lord receive these and journey with them.  Had I more Iwould give them to thee, but this is not the time to takeexception." Thereupon Nur al-Din went in to the damsel and toldher what had happened, at which she wrung her hands.  Then theyfared forth at once from the city, and Allah spread over them Hisveil of protection, so that they reached the river-bank wherethey found a vessel ready for sea.  Her skipper was standingamidships and crying, "Whoso hath aught to do, whether in the wayof provisioning or taking leave of his people; or whoso hathforgotten any needful thing, let him do it at once and return,for we are about to sail"; and all of them saying, "There isnaught left to be done by us, O captain!", he cried to his crew,"Hallo there! cast off the cable and pull up the mooring-pole!"[FN#40] Quoth Nur al-Din, "Whither bound, O captain?" andquoth he, "To the House of Peace, Baghdad,"—-And Shahrazadperceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.              When it was the Thirty-sixth Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when theskipper answered, "To the House of Peace, Baghdad," Nur al-DinAli and the damsel went on board, and they launched the craft andshook out the sails, and the ship sped forth as though she were abird on wing; even as said one of them and said right well,"Watch some tall ship, she'll joy the sight of thee, * The breeze     outstripping in her haste to flee;As when a bird, with widely-spreading wings, * Leaveth the sky to     settle on the sea."So the vessel sailed on her fastest and the wind to her wasfairest. Thus far concerning them; but as regards the Mamelukes,they went to Nur al-Din's mansion and, breaking open the doors,entered and searched the whole place, but could find no trace ofhim and the damsel; so they demolished the house and, returningto the Sultan, reported their proceedings; whereupon quoth he,"Make search for them both, wherever they may be;" and theyanswered, "Hearing is obeying."  The Wazir Al-Mu'ín had also gonehome after the Sultan had bestowed upon him a robe of honour, andhad set his heart at rest by saying, "None shall take blood-wreakfor thee save I;" and he had blessed the King and prayed for hislong life and prosperity.  Then the Sultan bade proclaim aboutthe city, "Oyez, O ye lieges one and all!  It is the will of ourlord the Sultan that whoso happeneth on Nur al-Din Ali son of Al-Fazl bin Khákán, and bringeth him to the Sultan, shall receive arobe of honour and one thousand gold pieces; and he who hidethhim or knoweth his abiding place and informeth not, deservethwhatsoever pains and penalties shall befal him."  So all began tosearch for Nur al-Din Ali, but they could find neither trace nortidings of him.  Meanwhile he and his handmaid sailed on with thewind right aft, till they arrived in safety at Baghdad, and thecaptain said to them, "This is Baghdad and 'tis the city wheresecurity is to be had: Winter with his frosts hath turned awayand Prime hath come his roses to display; and the flowers are a-glowing and the trees are blowing and the streams are flowing." So Nur al-Din landed, he and his handmaid and, giving the captainfive dinars, walked on a little way till the decrees of Destinybrought them among the gardens, and they came to a place sweptand sprinkled, with benches along the walls and hanging jarsfilled with water.[FN#41]  Overhead was a trellis of reed-workand canes shading the whole length of the avenue, and at theupper end was a garden gate, but this was locked.  "By Allah,"quoth Nur al-Din to the damsel, "right pleasant is this place!";and she replied, "O my lord sit with me a while on this bench andlet us take our ease."  So they mounted and sat them down on thebench, after which they washed their faces and hands; and thebreeze blew cool on them and they fell asleep and glory be to Himwho never sleepeth!  Not this garden was named the Garden ofGladness[FN#42] and therein stood a belvedere hight the Palace ofPleasure and the Pavilion of Pictures, the whole belonging to theCaliph Harun al-Rashid who was wont, when his breast wasstraitened with care, to frequent garden and palace and there tosit.  The palace had eighty latticed windows and fourscore lampshanging round a great candelabrum of gold furnished with wax-candles; and, when the Caliph used to enter, he would order thehandmaids to throw open the lattices and light up the rooms; andhe would bid Ishak bin Ibrahim the cup-companion and the slave-girls to sing till his breast was broadened and his ailments wereallayed.  Now the keeper of the garden, Shaykh Ibrahim, was avery old man, and he had found from time to time, when he wentout on any business, people pleasuring about the garden gate withtheir bona robas; at which he was angered with exceedinganger.[FN#43]  But he took patience till one day when the Caliphcame to his garden; and he complained of this to Harun al-Rashidwho said, "Whomsoever thou surprisest about the door of thegarden, deal with him as thou wilt."  Now on this day theGardener chanced to be abroad on some occasion and returningfound these two sleeping at the gate covered with a singlemantilla; whereupon said he, "By Allah, good!  These twain knownot that the Caliph hath given me leave to slay anyone I maycatch at the door; but I will give this couple a shrewd whipping,that none may come near the gate in future."  So he cut a greenpalm-frond[FN#44] and went up to them and, raising his arm tillthe white of his arm-pit appeared, was about to strike them, whenhe bethought himself and said, "O Ibrahim, wilt thou beat themunknowing their case?  Haply they are strangers or of the Sons ofthe Road,[FN#45] and the decrees of Destiny have thrown themhere.  I will uncover their faces and look at them."  So helifted up the mantilla from their heads and said, "They are ahandsome couple; it were not fitting that I should beat them." Then he covered their faces again and, going to Nur al-Din'sfeet, began to rub and shampoo them,[FN#46] whereupon the youthopened his eyes and, seeing an old man of grave and reverendaspect rubbing his feet, he was ashamed and drawing them in, satup.  Then he took Shaykh Ibrahim's hand and kissed it.  Quoth theold man, "O my son, whence art thou?"; and quoth he, "O my lord,we two are strangers," and the tears started from his eyes.  "Omy son," said Shaykh Ibrahim, "know that the Prophet (whom Allahbless and preserve!) hath enjoined honour to the stranger;" andadded, "Wilt not thou arise, O my son, and pass into the gardenand solace thyself by looking at it and gladden thy heart?"  "Omy lord," said Nur al-Din, "to whom doth this garden belong?;"and the other replied, "O my son, I have inherited it from myfolk."  Now his object in saying this was to set them at theirease and induce them to enter the garden.  So Nur al-Din thankedhim and rose, he and the damsel, and followed him into thegarden; and lo! it was a garden, and what a garden!  The gate wasarched like a great hall and over walls and roof ramped vineswith grapes of many colours; the red like rubies and the blacklike ebonies; and beyond it lay a bower of trelliced boughsgrowing fruits single and composite, and small birds on branchessang with melodious recite, and the thousand-noted nightingaleshrilled with her varied shright; the turtle with her cooingfilled the site; the blackbird whistled like human wight[FN#47]and the ring-dove moaned like a drinker in grievous plight.  Thetrees grew in perfection all edible growths and fruited allmanner fruits which in pairs were bipartite; with the camphor-apricot, the almond-apricot and the apricot "Khorasani" hight;the plum, like the face of beauty, smooth and bright; the cherrythat makes teeth shine clear by her sleight, and the fig of threecolours, green, purple and white.  There also blossomed theviolet as it were sulphur on fire by night; the orange with budslike pink coral and marguerite; the rose whose redness gars theloveliest cheeks blush with despight; and myrtle and gilliflowerand lavender with the blood-red anemone from Nu'uman hight.  Theleaves were all gemmed with tears the clouds had dight; thechamomile smiled showing teeth that bite, and Narcissus with hisnegro[FN#48] eyes fixed on Rose his sight; the citrons shone withfruits embowled and the lemons like balls of gold; earth wascarpeted with flowers tinctured infinite; for Spring was comebrightening the place with joy and delight; and the streams ranringing, to the birds' gay singing, while the rustling breezeupspringing attempered the air to temperance exquisite.  ShaykhIbrahim carried them up into the pavilion, and they gazed on itsbeauty, and on the lamps aforementioned in the latticed windows;and Nur al-Din, remembering his entertainments of time past,cried, "By Allah, this is a pleasant place; it hath quenched inme anguish which burned as a fire of Ghaza-wood.[FN#49]"  Thenthey sat down and Shaykh Ibrahim set food before them; and theyate till they were satisfied and washed their hands: after whichNur al-Din went up to one of the latticed windows, and, callingto his handmaid fell to gazing on the trees laden with all mannerfruits.  Presently he turned to the Gardener and said to him, "OShaykh Ibrahim hast thou no drink here, for folk are wont todrink after eating?"  The Shaykh brought him sweet water, cooland pleasant, but he said, "This is not the kind of drink Iwanted." "Perchance thou wishest for wine?"  "Indeed I do, OShaykh!"  "I seek refuge from it with Allah: it is thirteen yearssince I did this thing, for the Prophet (Abhak[FN#50]) cursed itsdrinker, presser, seller and carrier!"  "Hear two words of me." "Say on."  "If yon cursed ass[FN#51] which standeth there becursed, will aught of his curse alight upon thee?" "By no means!" "Then take this dinar and these two dirhams and mount yonder assand, halting afar from the wine-shop, call the first man thouseest buying liquor and say to him, 'Take these two dirhams forthyself, and with this dinar buy me some wine and set it on theass.' So shalt thou be neither the presser, nor the buyer, northe carrier; and no part of the curse will fall  upon thee."  Atthis Shaykh Ibrahim laughed and said, "By Allah, O my son, Inever saw one wilier of wit than thou art, nor heard aughtsweeter than thy speech."  So he did as he was bidden by Nur al-Din who thanked him and said, "We two are now dependent on thee,and it is only meet that thou comply with our wishes; so bring ushere what we require."  "O my son," replied he, "this is mybuttery before thee" (and it was the store-room provided for theCommander of the Faithful); "so go in, and take whatso thou wilt,for there is over and above what thou wantest."  Nur al-Din thenentered the pantry and found therein vessels of gold and silverand crystal set with all kinds of gems, and was amazed anddelighted with what he saw.  Then he took out what he needed andset it on and poured the wine into flagons and glass ewers,whilst Shaykh Ibrahim brought them fruit and flowers and aromaticherbs. Then the old man withdrew and sat down at a distance fromthem, whilst they drank and made merry, till the wine got thebetter of them, so that their cheeks reddened and their eyeswantoned like the gazelle's; and their locks became dishevelledand their brightness became yet more beautiful.  Then said ShaykhIbrahim to himself, "What aileth me to sit apart from them?  Whyshould I not sit with them?  When shall I ever find myself incompany with the like of these two that favour two moons?" So hestepped forward and sat down on the edge of the dais, and Nur al-Din said to him, "O my lord, my life on thee, come nearer to us!" He came and sat by them, when Nur al-Din filled a cup and lookedtowards the Shaykh and said to him, "Drink, that thou mayest trythe taste of it!" "I take refuge from it with Allah!" replied he;"for thirteen years I have not done a thing of the kind."  Nural-Din feigned to forget he was there and, drinking off the cup,threw himself on the ground as if the drink had overcome him;whereupon Anis al-Jalis glanced at him and said, "O ShaykhIbrahim see how this husband of mine treateth me;" and heanswered, "O my lady, what aileth him?"  "This is how he alwaysserveth me," cried she, "he drinketh awhile, then falleth asleepand leaveth me alone with none to bear me company over my cup norany to whom I may sing when the bowl goeth round."  Quoth theShaykh (and his mien unstiffened for that his soul inclinedtowards her), "By Allah, this is not well!" Then she crowned acup and looking towards him said, "By my life thou must take anddrink it, and not refuse to heal my sick heart!"  So he put forthhis hand and took it and drank it off and she filled a second andset it on the chandelier and said, "O master mine, there is stillthis one left for thee."  "By Allah, I cannot drink it;" criedhe, "what I have already drunk is enough for me;" but sherejoined, "By Allah, there is no help for it."  So he took thecup and drank; and she filled him a third which he took and wasabout to drink when behold, Nur al-Din rolled round and satupright,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceasedsaying her permitted say.             When it was the Thirty-seventh Night,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nur al-Dinsat upright and said, "Ho, Shaykh Ibrahim, what is this?  Did Inot adjure thee a while ago and thou refusedst, saying, 'What I!'tis thirteen years ago since I have done such a thing!'"  "ByAllah," quoth the Shaykh (and indeed he was abashed), "no sin ofmine this, she forced me to do it." Nur al-Din laughed and theysat down again to wine and wassail, but the damsel turned to hermaster and said in a whisper, "O my lord, drink an
