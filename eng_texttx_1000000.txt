Appendices I - XII                             PrefaceTHIS book is a slice of intensified history—history as I saw it. Itdoes not pretend to be anything but a detailed account of the NovemberRevolution, when the Bolsheviki, at the head of the workers andsoldiers, seized the state power of Russia and placed it in the handsof the Soviets.Naturally most of it deals with “Red Petrograd,” the capital and heartof the insurrection. But the reader must realize that what took placein Petrograd was almost exactly duplicated, with greater or lesserintensity, at different intervals of time, all over Russia.In this book, the first of several which I am writing, I must confinemyself to a chronicle of those events which I myself observed andexperienced, and those supported by reliable evidence; preceded by twochapters briefly outlining the background and causes of the NovemberRevolution. I am aware that these two chapters make difficult reading,but they are essential to an understanding of what follows.Many questions will suggest themselves to the mind of the reader. Whatis Bolshevism? What kind of a governmental structure did the Bolshevikiset up? If the Bolsheviki championed the Constituent Assembly beforethe November Revolution, why did they disperse it by force of armsafterward? And if the bourgeoisie opposed the Constituent Assemblyuntil the danger of Bolshevism became apparent, why did they championit afterward?These and many other questions cannot be answered here. In anothervolume, “Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk,” I trace the course of theRevolution up to and including the German  peace. There I explain theorigin and functions of the Revolutionary organisations, the evolutionof popular sentiment, the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, thestructure of the Soviet state, and the course and outcome of the Brest-Litovsk negotiations….In considering the rise of the Bolsheviki it is necessary to understandthat Russian economic life and the Russian army were not disorganisedon November 7th, 1917, but many months before, as the logical result ofa process which began as far back as 1915. The corrupt reactionaries incontrol of the Tsar’s Court deliberately undertook to wreck Russia inorder to make a separate peace with Germany. The lack of arms on thefront, which had caused the great retreat of the summer of 1915, thelack of food in the army and in the great cities, the break-down ofmanufactures and transportation in 1916—all these we know now were partof a gigantic campaign of sabotage. This was halted just in time by theMarch Revolution.For the first few months of the new régime, in spite of the confusionincident upon a great Revolution, when one hundred and sixty millionsof the world’s most oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty, boththe internal situation and the combative power of the army actuallyimproved.But the “honeymoon” was short. The propertied classes wanted merely apolitical revolution, which would take the power from the Tsar and giveit to them. They wanted Russia to be a constitutional Republic, likeFrance or the United States; or a constitutional Monarchy, likeEngland. On the other hand, the masses of the people wanted realindustrial and agrarian democracy.William English Walling, in his book, “Russia’s Message,” an account ofthe Revolution of 1905, describes very well the state of mind of theRussian workers, who were later to support Bolshevism almostunanimously:They (the working people) saw it was possible that even under a freeGovernment, if it fell into the hands of other social classes, theymight still continue to starve….The Russian workman is revolutionary, but he is neither violent,dogmatic, nor unintelligent. He is ready for barricades, but he hasstudied them, and alone of the workers of the world he has learnedabout them from actual experience. He is ready and willing to fight hisoppressor, the capitalist class, to a finish. But he does not ignorethe existence of other classes. He merely asks that the other classestake one side or the other in the bitter conflict that draws near….They (the workers) were all agreed that our (American) politicalinstitutions were preferable to their own, but they were not veryanxious to exchange one despot for another (i.e., the capitalistclass)….The workingmen of Russia did not have themselves shot down, executed byhundreds in Moscow, Riga and Odessa, imprisoned by thousands in everyRussian jail, and exiled to the deserts and the arctic regions, inexchange for the doubtful privileges of the workingmen of Goldfieldsand Cripple Creek….And so developed in Russia, in the midst of a foreign war, the SocialRevolution on top of the Political Revolution, culminating in thetriumph of Bolshevism.Mr. A. J. Sack, director in this country of the Russian InformationBureau, which opposes the Soviet Government, has this to say in hisbook, “The Birth of the Russian Democracy”: The Bolsheviks organisedtheir own cabinet, with Nicholas Lenine as Premier and Leon Trotsky—Minister of Foreign Affairs. The inevitability of their coming intopower became evident almost immediately after the March Revolution. Thehistory of the Bolsheviki, after the Revolution, is a history of theirsteady growth….Foreigners, and Americans especially, frequently emphasise the“ignorance” of the Russian workers. It is true they lacked thepolitical experience of the peoples of the West, but they were verywell trained in voluntary organisation. In 1917 there were more thantwelve million members of the Russian consumers’ Cooperative societies;and the Soviets themselves are a wonderful demonstration of theirorganising genius. Moreover, there is probably not a people in theworld so well educated in Socialist theory and its practicalapplication.William English Walling thus characterises them:The Russian working people are for the most part able to read andwrite. For many years the country has been in such a disturbedcondition that they have had the advantage of leadership not only ofintelligent individuals in their midst, but of a large part of theequally revolutionary educated class, who have turned to the workingpeople with their ideas for the political and social regeneration ofRussia….Many writers explain their hostility to the Soviet Government byarguing that the last phase of the Russian Revolution was simply astruggle of the “respectable” elements against the brutal attacks ofBolshevism. However, it was the propertied classes, who, when theyrealised the growth in power of the popular revolutionaryorganisations, undertook to destroy them and to halt the Revolution. Tothis end the propertied classes finally resorted to desperate measures.In order to wreck the Kerensky Ministry and the Soviets, transportationwas disorganised and internal troubles provoked; to crush the Factory-Shop Committees, plants were shut down, and fuel and raw materialsdiverted; to break the Army Committees at the front, capital punishmentwas restored and military defeat connived at.This was all excellent fuel for the Bolshevik fire. The Bolshevikiretorted by preaching the class war, and by asserting the supremacy ofthe Soviets.Between these two extremes, with the other factions which whole-heartedly or half-heartedly supported them, were the so-called“moderate” Socialists, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries,and several smaller parties. These groups were also attacked by thepropertied classes, but their power of resistance was crippled by theirtheories.Roughly, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries believed thatRussia was not economically ripe for a social revolution—that only a_political_ revolution was possible. According to their interpretation,the Russian masses were not educated enough to take over the power; anyattempt to do so would inevitably bring on a reaction, by means ofwhich some ruthless opportunist might restore the old régime. And so itfollowed that when the “moderate” Socialists were forced to assume thepower, they were afraid to use it.They believed that Russia must pass through the stages of political andeconomic development known to Western Europe, and emerge at last, withthe rest of the world, into full-fledged Socialism. Naturally,therefore, they agreed with the propertied classes that Russia mustfirst be a parliamentary state—though with some improvements on theWestern democracies. As a consequence, they insisted upon thecollaboration of the propertied classes in the Government.From this it was an easy step to supporting them. The “moderate”Socialists needed the bourgeoisie. But the bourgeoisie did not need the“moderate” Socialists. So it resulted in the Socialist Ministers beingobliged to give way, little by little, on their entire program, whilethe propertied classes grew more and more insistent.And at the end, when the Bolsheviki upset the whole hollow compromise,the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries found themselves fightingon the side of the propertied classes…. In almost every country in theworld to-day the same phenomenon is visible.Instead of being a destructive force, it seems to me that theBolsheviki were the only party in Russia with a constructive programand the power to impose it on the country. If they had not succeeded tothe Government when they did, there is little doubt in my mind that thearmies of Imperial Germany would have been in Petrograd and Moscow inDecember, and Russia would again be ridden by a Tsar….It is still fashionable, after a whole year of the Soviet Government,to speak of the Bolshevik insurrection as an “adventure.” Adventure itwas, and one of the most marvellous mankind ever embarked upon,sweeping into history at the head of the toiling masses, and stakingeverything on their vast and simple desires. Already the machinery hadbeen set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributedamong the peasants. The Factory-Shop Committees and the Trade Unionswere there to put into operation workers’ control of industry. In everyvillage, town, city, district and province there were Soviets ofWorkers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, prepared to assume the taskof local administration.No matter what one thinks of Bolshevism, it is undeniable that theRussian Revolution is one of the great events of human history, and therise of the Bolsheviki a phenomenon of world-wide importance. Just ashistorians search the records for the minutest details of the story ofthe Paris Commune, so they will want to know what happened in Petrogradin November, 1917, the spirit which animated the people, and how theleaders looked, talked and acted. It is with this in view that I havewritten this book.In the struggle my sympathies were not neutral. But in telling thestory of those great days I have tried to see events with the eye of aconscientious reporter, interested in setting down the truth.                                        J. R.    New York, January 1st 1919.                        Notes and ExplanationsTo the average reader the multiplicity of Russianorganisations-political groups, Committees and Central Committees,Soviets, Dumas and Unions-will prove extremely confusing. For thisreason I am giving here a few brief definitions and explanations.                        Political PartiesIn the elections to the Constituent Assembly, there were seventeentickets in Petrograd, and in some of the provincial towns as many asforty; but the following summary of the aims and composition ofpolitical parties is limited to the groups and factions mentioned inthis book. Only the essence of their programmes and the generalcharacter of their constituencies can be noticed....  1. _Monarchists,_ of various shades, _Octobrists,_ etc. Theseonce-powerful factions no longer existed openly; they either workedunderground, or their members joined the _Cadets,_ as the _Cadets_came by degrees to stand for their political programme.Representatives in this book, Rodzianko, Shulgin.  2. _Cadets._ So-called from the initials of its name,Constitutional Democrats. Its official name is "Party of the People'sFreedom." Under the Tsar composed of Liberals from the propertiedclasses, the _Cadets_ were the great party of _political_ reform,roughly corresponding to the Progressive Party in America. When theRevolution broke out in March, 1917, the _Cadets_ formed the firstProvisional Government. The _Cadet_ Ministry was overthrown in Aprilbecause it declared itself in favour of Allied imperialistic aims,including the imperialistic aims of the Tsar's Government. As theRevolution became more and more a _social economic_ Revolution, the_Cadets_ grew more and more conservative. Its representatives in thisbook are: Miliukov, Vinaver, Shatsky.  2a. _Group of Public Men._ After the _Cadets_ had become unpopularthrough their relations with the Kornilov counter-revolution, the_Group of Public Men_ was formed in Moscow. Delegates from the _Groupof Public Men_ were given portfolios in the last Kerensky Cabinet.The _Group_ declared itself non-partisan, although its intellectualleaders were men like Rodzianko and Shulgin. It was composed of themore "modern" bankers, merchants and manufacturers, who wereintelligent enough to realise that the Soviets must be fought bytheir own weapon-economic organisation. Typical of the _Group:_Lianozov, Konovalov.  3. _Populist Socialists,_ or _Trudoviki_ (Labour Group).Numerically a small party, composed of cautious intellectuals, theleaders of the Cooperative societies, and conservative peasants.Professing to be Socialists, the _Populists_ really supported theinterests of the petty bourgeoisie-clerks, shopkeepers, etc. Bydirect descent, inheritors of the compromising tradition of theLabour Group in the Fourth Imperial Duma, which was composed largelyof peasant representatives. Kerensky was the leader of the_Trudoviki_ in the Imperial Duma when the Revolution of March, 1917,broke out. The _Populist Socialists_ are a nationalistic party. Theirrepresentatives in this book are: Peshekhanov, Tchaikovsky.  4. _Russian Social Democratic Labour Party._ Originally MarxianSocialists. At a party congress held in 1903, the party split, on thequestion of tactics, into two factions-the Majority (Bolshinstvo),and the Minority (Menshinstvo). From this sprang the names"Bolsheviki" and "Mensheviki"-"members of the majority" and "membersof the minority." These two wings became two separate parties, bothcalling themselves "Russian Social Democratic Labour Party," and bothprofessing to be Marxians. Since the Revolution of 1905 theBolsheviki were really the minority, becoming again the majority inSeptember, 1917.  a. _Mensheviki._ This party includes all shades of Socialists whobelieve that society must progress by natural evolution towardSocialism, and that the working-class must conquer political powerfirst. Also a nationalistic party. This was the party of theSocialist intellectuals, which means: all the means of educationhaving been in the hands of the propertied classes, the intellectualsinstinctively reacted to their training, and took the side of thepropertied classes. Among their representatives in this book are:Dan, Lieber, Tseretelli.  b. _Mensheviki Internationalists._ The radical wing of the_Mensheviki,_ internationalists and opposed to all coalition with thepropertied classes; yet unwilling to break loose from theconservative Mensheviki, and opposed to the dictatorship of theworking-class advocated by the Bolsheviki. Trotzky was long a memberof this group. Among their leaders: Martov, Martinov.  c. _Bolsheviki._ Now call themselves the _Communist Party,_ inorder to emphasise their complete separation from the tradition of"moderate" or "parliamentary" Socialism, which dominates theMensheviki and the so-called Majority Socialists in all countries.The _Bolsheviki_ proposed immediate proletarian insurrection, andseizure of the reins of Government, in order to hasten the coming ofSocialism by forcibly taking over industry, land, natural resourcesand financial institutions. This party expresses the desires chieflyof the factory workers, but also of a large section of the poorpeasants. The name "Bolshevik" can _not_ be translated by"Maximalist." The Maximalists are a separate group. (See paragraph5b). Among the leaders: Lenin, Trotzky, Lunatcharsky.  d. _United Social Democrats Internationalists._ Also called the_Novaya Zhizn_ (New Life) group, from the name of the veryinfluential newspaper which was its organ. A little group ofintellectuals with a very small following among the working-class,except the personal following of Maxim Gorky, its leader.Intellectuals, with almost the same programme as the _MenshevikiInternationalists,_ except that the _Novaya Zhizn_ group refused tobe tied to either of the two great factions. Opposed the Bolsheviktactics, but remained in the Soviet Government. Other representativesin this book: Avilov, Kramarov.  e. _Yedinstvo._ A very small and dwindling group, composed almostentirely of the personal following of Plekhanov, one of the pioneersof the Russian Social Democratic movement in the 80's, and itsgreatest theoretician. Now an old man, Plekhanov was extremelypatriotic, too conservative even for the Mensheviki. After theBolshevik _coup d'etat, Yedinstvo_ disappeared.  5. _Socialist Revolutionary party._ Called _Essaires_ from theinitials of their name. Originally the revolutionary party of thepeasants, the party of the Fighting Organisations-the Terrorists.After the March Revolution, it was joined by many who had never beenSocialists. At that time it stood for the abolition of privateproperty in land only, the owners to be compensated in some fashion.Finally the increasing revolutionary feeling of peasants forced the_Essaires_ to abandon the "compensation" clause, and led to theyounger and more fiery intellectuals breaking off from the main partyin the fall of 1917 and forming a new party, the _Left SocialistRevolutionary party._ The _Essaires,_ who were afterward alwayscalled by the radical groups _"Right Socialist Revolutionaries,"_adopted the political attitude of the Mensheviki, and worked togetherwith them. They finally came to represent the wealthier peasants, theintellectuals, and the politically uneducated populations of remoterural districts. Among them there was, however, a wider difference ofshades of political and economic opinion than among the Mensheviki.Among their leaders mentioned in these pages: Avksentiev, Gotz,Kerensky, Tchernov, "Babuschka" Breshkovskaya.  a. _Left Socialist Revolutionaries._ Although theoretically sharingthe Bolshevik programme of dictatorship of the working-class, atfirst were reluctant to follow the ruthless Bolshevik tactics.However, the _Left Socialist Revolutionaries_ remained in the SovietGovernment, sharing the Cabinet portfolios, especially that ofAgriculture. They withdrew from the Government several times, butalways returned. As the peasants left the ranks of the _Essaires_ inincreasing numbers, they joined the _Left Socialist Revolutionaryparty,_ which became the great peasant party supporting the SovietGovernment, standing for confiscation without compensation of thegreat landed estates, and their disposition by the peasantsthemselves. Among the leaders: Spiridonova, Karelin, Kamkov,Kalagayev.  b. _Maximalists._ An off-shoot of the _Socialist Revolutionaryparty_ in the Revolution of 1905, when it was a powerful peasantmovement, demanding the immediate application of the maximumSocialist programme. Now an insignificant group of peasantanarchists.                        Parliamentary ProcedureRussian meetings and conventions are organised after the continentalmodel rather than our own. The first action is usually the electionof officers and the _presidium._  The _presidium_ is a presiding committee, composed ofrepresentatives of the groups and political factions represented inthe assembly, in proportion to their numbers. The _presidium_arranges the Order of Business, and its members can be called upon bythe President to take the chair _pro tem._  Each question (_vopros_) is stated in a general way and thendebated, and at the close of the debate resolutions are submitted bythe different factions, and each one voted on separately. The Orderof Business can be, and usually is, smashed to pieces in the firsthalf hour. On the plea of "emergency," which the crowd almost alwaysgrants, anybody from the floor can get up and say anything on anysubject. The crowd controls the meeting, practically the onlyfunctions of the speaker being to keep order by ringing a littlebell, and to recognise speakers. Almost all the real work of thesession is done in caucuses of the different groups and politicalfactions, which almost always cast their votes in a body and arerepresented by floor-leaders. The result is, however, that at everyimportant new point, or vote, the session takes a recess to enablethe different groups and political factions to hold a caucus.  The crowd is extremely noisy, cheering or heckling speakers,over-riding the plans of the _presidium._ Among the customary criesare: _"Prosim!_ Please! Go on!" _"Pravilno!"_ or _"Eto vierno!_That's true! Right!" _"Do volno!_ Enough!" _"Doloi!_ Down with him!"_"Posor!_ Shame!" and _"Teesche!_ Silence! Not so noisy!"                        Popular Organisations1. _Soviet._ The word _soviet_ means "council." Under the Tsar theImperial Council of State was called _Gosudarstvennyi Soviet._ Sincethe Revolution, however, the term _Soviet_ has come to be associatedwith a certain type of parliament elected by members of working-classeconomic organisations-the Soviet of Workers', of Soldiers', or ofPeasants' Deputies. I have therefore limited the word to thesebodies, and wherever else it occurs I have translated it "Council."  Besides the local _Soviets,_ elected in every city, town andvillage of Russia-and in large cities, also Ward _(Raionny)Soviets_-there are also the _oblastne_ or _gubiernsky_ (district orprovincial) _Soviets,_ and the Central Executive Committee of theAll-Russian _Soviets_ in the capital, called from its initials_Tsay-ee-kah._ (See below, "Central Committees").  Almost everywhere the _Soviets_ of Workers' and of Soldiers'Deputies combined very soon after the March Revolution. In specialmatters concerning their peculiar interests, however, the Workers'and the Soldiers' Sections continued to meet separately. The_Soviets_ of Peasants' Deputies did not join the other two untilafter the Bolshevik _coup d'etat._ They, too, were organised like theworkers and soldiers, with an Executive Committee of the All-RussianPeasants' _Soviets_ in the capital.  2. _Trade Unions._ Although mostly industrial in form, the Russianlabour unions were still called Trade Unions, and at the time of theBolshevik Revolution had from three to four million members. TheseUnions were also organised in an All-Russian body, a sort of RussianFederation of Labour, which had its Central Executive Committee inthe capital.  3. _Factory-Shop Committees._ These were spontaneous organisationscreated in the factories by the workers in their attempt to controlindustry, taking advantage of the administrative break-down incidentupon the Revolution. Their function was by revolutionary action totake over and run the factories. The _Factory-Shop Committees_ alsohad their All-Russian organisation, with a Central Committee atPetrograd, which co-operated with the Trade Unions.  4. _Dumas._ The word _duma_ means roughly "deliberative body." Theold Imperial Duma, which persisted six months after the Revolution,in a democratised form, died a natural death in September, 1917. The_City Duma_ referred to in this book was the reorganised MunicipalCouncil, often called "Municipal Self-Government." It was elected bydirect and secret ballot, and its only reason for failure to hold themasses during the Bolshevik Revolution was the general decline ininfluence of all purely _political_ representation in the fact of thegrowing power of organisations based on _economic_ groups.  5. _Zemstvos._ May be roughly translated "county councils." Underthe Tsar semi-political, semi-social bodies with very littleadministrative power, developed and controlled largely byintellectual Liberals among the land-owning classes. Their mostimportant function was education and social service among thepeasants. During the war the _Zemstvos_ gradually took over theentire feeding and clothing of the Russian Army, as well as thebuying from foreign countries, and work among the soldiers generallycorresponding to the work of the American Y. M. C. A. at the Front.After the March Revolution the _Zemstvos_ were democratized, with aview to making them the organs of local government in the ruraldistricts. But like the _City Dumas,_ they could not compete with the_Soviets._  6. _Cooperatives._ These were the workers' and peasants' Consumers'Cooperative societies, which had several million members all overRussia before the Revolution. Founded by Liberals and "moderate"Socialists, the Cooperative movement was not supported by therevolutionary Socialist groups, because it was a substitute for thecomplete transference of means of production and distribution intothe hands of the workers. After the March Revolution the_Cooperatives_ spread rapidly, and were dominated by PopulistSocialists, Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, and acted as aconservative political force until the Bolshevik Revolution. However,it was the _Cooperatives_ which fed Russia when the old structure ofcommerce and transportation collapsed.  7. _Army Committees._ The _Army Committees_ were formed by thesoldiers at the front to combat the reactionary influence of the oldregime officers. Every company, regiment, brigade, division and corpshad its committee, over all of which was elected the _ArmyCommittee._ The _Central Army Committee_ cooperated with the GeneralStaff. The administrative break-down in the army incident upon theRevolution threw upon the shoulders of the _Army Committees_ most ofthe work of the Quartermaster's Department, and in some cases, eventhe command of troops.  8. _Fleet Committees._ The corresponding organisations in the Navy.                        Central CommitteesIn the spring and summer of 1917, All-Russian conventions of everysort of organisation were held at Petrograd. There were nationalcongresses of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Soviets, TradeUnions, Factory-Shop Committees, Army and Fleet Committees-besidesevery branch of the military and naval service, Cooperatives,Nationalities, etc. Each of these conventions elected a CentralCommittee, or a Central Executive Committee, to guard its particularinterests at the seat of Government. As the Provisional Governmentgrew weaker, these Central Committees were forced to assume more andmore administrative powers.  The most important Central Committees mentioned in this book are:  _Union of Unions._ During the Revolution of 1905, ProfessorMiliukov and other Liberals established unions of professionalmen-doctors, lawyers, physicians, etc. These were united under onecentral organisation, the _Union of Unions._ In 1905 the _Union ofUnions_ acted with the revolutionary democracy; in 1917, however, the_Union of Unions_ opposed the Bolshevik uprising, and united theGovernment employees who went on strike against the authority of theSoviets.  _Tsay-ee-kah._ All-Russian Central Executive Committee of theSoviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. So called from theinitials of its name.  _Tsentroflot._ "Centre-Fleet"-the Central Fleet Committee.  _Vikzhel._ All-Russian Central Committee of the Railway Workers'Union. So called from the initials of its name.                        Other Organisations_Red Guards._ The armed factory workers of Russia. The _Red Guards_were first formed during the Revolution of 1905, and sprang intoexistence again in the days of March, 1917, when a force was neededto keep order in the city. At that time they were armed, and allefforts of the Provisional Government to disarm them were more orless unsuccessful. At every great crisis in the Revolution the _RedGuards_ appeared on the streets, untrained and undisciplined, butfull of Revolutionary zeal.  _White Guards._ Bourgeois volunteers, who emerged in the laststages of the Revolution, to defend private property from theBolshevik attempt to abolish it. A great many of them were Universitystudents.  _Tekhintsi._ The so-called "Savage Division" in the army, made upof Mohametan tribesmen from Central Asia, and personally devoted toGeneral Kornilov. The _Tekhintsi_ were noted for their blindobedience and their savage cruelty in warfare.  _Death Battalions._ Or _Shock Battalions._ The Women's Battalion isknown to the world as the _Death Battalion,_ but there were many_Death Battalions_ composed of men. These were formed in the summerof 1917 by Kerensky, for the purpose of strengthening the disciplineand combative fire of the army by heroic example. The _DeathBattalions_ were composed mostly of intense young patriots. Thesecame for the most part from among the sons of the propertied classes.  _Union of Officers._ An organisation formed among the reactionaryofficers in the army to combat politically the growing power of theArmy Committees.  _Knights of St. George._ The Cross of St. George was awarded fordistinguished action in battle. Its holder automatically became a_"Knight of St. George."_ The predominant influence in theorganisation was that of the supporters of the military idea.  _Peasants' Union._ In 1905, the _Peasants' Union_ was arevolutionary peasants' organisation. In 1917, however, it had becomethe political expression of the more prosperous peasants, to fightthe growing power and revolutionary aims of the Soviets of Peasants'Deputies.                        Chronology and SpellingI have adopted in this book our Calendar throughout, instead of theformer Russian Calendar, which was thirteen days earlier.  In the spelling of Russian names and words, I have made no attemptto follow any scientific rules for transliteration, but have tried togive the spelling which would lead the English-speaking reader to thesimplest approximation of their pronunciation.                        SourcesMuch of the material in this book is from my own notes. I have alsorelied, however, upon a heterogeneous file of several hundredassorted Russian newspapers, covering almost every day of the timedescribed, of files of the English paper, the _Russian Daily News,_and of the two French papers, _Journal de Russie_ and _Entente._ Butfar more valuable than these is the _Bulletin de la Presse_ issueddaily by the French Information Bureau in Petrograd, which reportsall important happenings, speeches and the comment of the Russianpress. Of this I have an almost complete file from the spring of 1917to the end of January, 1918.  Besides the foregoing, I have in my possession almost everyproclamation, decree and announcement posted on the walls ofPetrograd from the middle of September, 1917, to the end of January,1918. Also the official publication of all Government decrees andorders, and the official Government publication of the secrettreaties and other documents discovered in the Ministry of ForeignAffairs when the Bolsheviki took it over.                  Ten Days That Shook The World                              Chapter I                             BackgroundTOWARD the end of September, 1917, an alien Professor of Sociologyvisiting Russia came to see me in Petrograd. He had been informed bybusiness men and intellectuals that the Revolution was slowing down.The Professor wrote an article about it, and then travelled aroundthe country, visiting factory towns and peasant communities-where, tohis astonishment, the Revolution seemed to be speeding up. Among thewage-earners and the land-working people it was common to hear talkof "all land to the peasants, all factories to the workers." If theProfessor had visited the front, he would have heard the whole Armytalking Peace....The Professor was puzzled, but he need not have been; bothobservations were correct. The property-owning classes were becomingmore conservative, the masses of the people more radical.There was a feeling among business men and the _intelligentzia_generally that the Revolution had gone quite far enough, and lastedtoo long; that things should settle down. This sentiment was sharedby the dominant "moderate" Socialist groups, the _oborontsi_ (SeeApp. I, Sect. 1) Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, whosupported the Provisional Government of Kerensky.On October 14th the official organ of the "moderate" Socialists said:The drama of Revolution has two acts; the destruction of the oldrégime and the creation of the new one. The first act has lasted longenough. Now it is time to go on to the second, and to play it asrapidly as possible. As a great revolutionist put it, "Let us hasten,friends, to terminate the Revolution. He who makes it last too longwill not gather the fruits...."Among the worker, soldier and peasant masses, however, there was astubborn feeling that the "first act" was not yet played out. On thefront the Army Committees were always running foul of officers whocould not get used to treating their men like human beings; in therear the Land Committees elected by the peasants were being jailedfor trying to carry out Government regulations concerning the land;and the workmen (See App. I, Sect. 2) in the factories were fightingblack-lists and lockouts. Nay, furthermore, returning politicalexiles were being excluded from the country as "undesirable"citizens; and in some cases, men who returned from abroad to theirvillages were prosecuted and imprisoned for revolutionary actscommitted in 1905.To the multiform discontent of the people the "moderate" Socialistshad one answer: Wait for the Constituent Assembly, which is to meetin December. But the masses were not satisfied with that. TheConstituent Assembly was all well and good; but there were certaindefinite things for which the Russian Revolution had been made, andfor which the revolutionary martyrs rotted in their stark BrotherhoodGrave on Mars Field, that must be achieved Constituent Assembly or noConstituent Assembly: Peace, Land, and Workers' Control of Industry.The Constituent Assembly had been postponed and postponed-wouldprobably be postponed again, until the people were calmenough-perhaps to modify their demands! At any rate, here were eightmonths of the Revolution gone, and little enough to show for it....Meanwhile the soldiers began to solve the peace question by simplydeserting, the peasants burned manor-houses and took over the greatestates, the workers sabotaged and struck.... Of course, as wasnatural, the manufacturers, land-owners and army officers exerted alltheir influence against any democratic compromise....The policy of the Provisional Government alternated betweenineffective reforms and stern repressive measures. An edict from theSocialist Minister of Labour ordered all the Workers' Committeeshenceforth to meet only after working hours. Among the troops at thefront, "agitators" of opposition political parties were arrested,radical newspapers closed down, and capital punishment applied-torevolutionary propagandists. Attempts were made to disarm the RedGuard. Cossacks were sent to keep order in the provinces....These measures were supported by the "moderate" Socialists and theirleaders in the Ministry, who considered it necessary to cooperatewith the propertied classes. The people rapidly deserted them, andwent over to the Bolsheviki, who stood for Peace, Land, and Workers'Control of Industry, and a Government of the working-class. InSeptember, 1917, matters reached a crisis. Against the overwhelmingsentiment of the country, Kerensky and the "moderate" Socialistssucceeded in establishing a Government of Coalition with thepropertied classes; and as a result, the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries lost the confidence of the people forever.An article in _Rabotchi Put_ (Workers' Way) about the middle ofOctober, entitled "The Socialist Ministers," expressed the feeling ofthe masses of the people against the "moderate" Socialists:Here is a list of their services.(See App. I, Sect. 3)Tseretelli: disarmed the workmen with the assistance of GeneralPolovtsev, checkmated the revolutionary soldiers, and approved ofcapital punishment in the army.Skobeliev: commenced by trying to tax the capitalists 100% of theirprofits, and finished-and finished by an attempt to dissolve theWorkers' Committees in the shops and factories.Avksentiev: put several hundred peasants in prison, members of theLand Committees, and suppressed dozens of workers' and soldiers'newspapers.Tchernov: signed the "Imperial" manifest, ordering the dissolution ofthe Finnish Diet.Savinkov: concluded an open alliance with General Kornilov. If thissaviour of the country was not able to betray Petrograd, it was dueto reasons over which he had no control.Zarudny: with the sanction of Alexinsky and Kerensky, put some of thebest workers of the Revolution, soldiers and sailors, in prison.Nikitin: acted as a vulgar policeman against the Railway Workers.Kerensky: it is better not to say anything about him. The list of hisservices is too long....A Congress of delegates of the Baltic Fleet, at Helsingfors, passed aresolution which began as follows:We demand the immediate removal from the ranks of the ProvisionalGovernment of the "Socialist," the political adventurer-Kerensky, asone who is scandalising and ruining the great Revolution, and with itthe revolutionary masses, by his shameless political blackmail onbehalf of the bourgeoisie....The direct result of all this was the rise of the Bolsheviki....Since March, 1917, when the roaring torrents of workmen and soldiersbeating upon the Tauride Palace compelled the reluctant Imperial Dumato assume the supreme power in Russia, it was the masses of thepeople, workers, soldiers and peasants, which forced every change inthe course of the Revolution. They hurled the Miliukov Ministry down;it was their Soviet which proclaimed to the world the Russian peaceterms-"No annexations, no indemnities, and the right ofself-determination of peoples"; and again, in July, it was thespontaneous rising of the unorganised proletariat which once morestormed the Tauride Palace, to demand that the Soviets take over theGovernment of Russia.The Bolsheviki, then a small political sect, put themselves at thehead of the movement. As a result of the disastrous failure of therising, public opinion turned against them, and their leaderlesshordes slunk back into the Viborg Quarter, which is Petrograd's _St.Antoine._ Then followed a savage hunt of the Bolsheviki; hundredswere imprisoned, among them Trotzky, Madame Kollontai and Kameniev;Lenin and Zinoviev went into hiding, fugitives from justice; theBolshevik papers were suppressed. Provocators and reactionariesraised the cry that the Bolsheviki were German agents, until peopleall over the world believed it.But the Provisional Government found itself unable to substantiateits accusations; the documents proving pro-German conspiracy werediscovered to be forgeries; [*] and one by one the Bolsheviki were[*Part of the famous "Sisson Documents"]released from prison without trial, on nominal or no bail-until onlysix remained. The impotence and indecision of the ever-changingProvisional Government was an argument nobody could refute. TheBolsheviki raised again the slogan so dear to the masses, "All Powerto the Soviets!"-and they were not merely self-seeking, for at thattime the majority of the Soviets was "moderate" Socialist, theirbitter enemy.But more potent still, they took the crude, simple desires of theworkers, soldiers and peasants, and from them built their immediateprogramme. And so, while the _oborontsi_ Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries involved themselves in compromise with thebourgeoisie, the Bolsheviki rapidly captured the Russian masses. InJuly they were hunted and despised; by September the metropolitanworkmen, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet, and the soldiers, had beenwon almost entirely to their cause. The September municipal electionsin the large cities (See App. I, Sect. 4) were significant; only 18per cent of the returns were Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary,against more than 70 per cent in June....There remains a phenomenon which puzzled foreign observers: the factthat the Central Executive Committees of the Soviets, the CentralArmy and Fleet Committees, [*] and the Central Committees of some of[*See Notes and Explanations.]the Unions-notably, the Post and Telegraph Workers and the RailwayWorkers-opposed the Bolsheviki with the utmost violence. TheseCentral Committees had all been elected in the middle of the summer,or even before, when the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries hadan enormous following; and they delayed or prevented any newelections. Thus, according to the constitution of the Soviets ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies, the All-Russian Congress _shouldhave been called in September;_ but the _Tsay-ee-kah_ [*] would not[*See Notes and Explanations.]call the meeting, on the ground that the Constituent Assembly wasonly two months away, at which time, they hinted, the Soviets wouldabdicate. Meanwhile, one by one, the Bolsheviki were winning in thelocal Soviets all over the country, in the Union branches and theranks of the soldiers and sailors. The Peasants' Soviets remainedstill conservative, because in the sluggish rural districts politicalconsciousness developed slowly, and the Socialist Revolutionary partyhad been for a generation the party which had agitated among thepeasants.... But even among the peasants a revolutionary wing wasforming. It showed itself clearly in October, when the left wing ofthe Socialist Revolutionaries split off, and formed a new politicalfaction, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries.At the same time there were signs everywhere that the forces ofreaction were gaining confidence.(See App. I, Sect. 5) At theTroitsky Farce theatre in Petrograd, for example, a burlesque called_Sins of the Tsar_ was interrupted by a group of Monarchists, whothreatened to lynch the actors for "insulting the Emperor." Certainnewspapers began to sigh for a "Russian Napoleon." It was the usualthing among bourgeois _intelligentzia_ to refer to the Soviets ofWorkers' Deputies (Rabotchikh Deputatov) as _Sabatchikh_Deputatov-Dogs' Deputies.On October 15th I had a conversation with a great Russian capitalist,Stepan Georgevitch Lianozov, known as the "Russian Rockefeller"-aCadet by political faith."Revolution," he said, "is a sickness. Sooner or later the foreignpowers must intervene here-as one would intervene to cure a sickchild, and teach it how to walk. Of course it would be more or lessimproper, but the nations must realise the danger of Bolshevism intheir own countries-such contagious ideas as 'proletariandictatorship,' and 'world social revolution'... There is a chance thatthis intervention may not be necessary. Transportation isdemoralised, the factories are closing down, and the Germans areadvancing. Starvation and defeat may bring the Russian people totheir senses...."Mr. Lianozov was emphatic in his opinion that whatever happened, itwould be impossible for merchants and manufacturers to permit theexistence of the workers' Shop Committees, or to allow the workersany share in the management of industry."As for the Bolsheviki, they will be done away with by one of twomethods. The Government can evacuate Petrograd, then a state of siegedeclared, and the military commander of the district can deal withthese gentlemen without legal formalities.... _Or if, for example, theConstituent Assembly manifests any Utopian tendencies, it can bedispersed by force of arms...."_Winter was coming on-the terrible Russian winter. I heard businessmen speak of it so: "Winter was always Russia's best friend. Perhapsnow it will rid us of Revolution." On the freezing front miserablearmies continued to starve and die, without enthusiasm. The railwayswere breaking down, food lessening, factories closing. The desperatemasses cried out that the bourgeoisie was sabotaging the life of thepeople, causing defeat on the Front. Riga had been surrendered justafter General Kornilov said publicly, "Must we pay with Riga theprice of bringing the country to a sense of its duty?" [*][* See "Kornilov to Brest-Litvosk" by John Reed. Boni and LiverightN.Y., 1919]To Americans it is incredible that the class war should develop tosuch a pitch. But I have personally met officers on the NorthernFront who frankly preferred military disaster to cooperation with theSoldiers' Committees. The secretary of the Petrograd branch of theCadet party told me that the break-down of the country's economiclife was part of a campaign to discredit the Revolution. An Allieddiplomat, whose name I promised not to mention, confirmed this fromhis own knowledge. I know of certain coal-mines near Kharkov whichwere fired and flooded by their owners, of textile factories atMoscow whose engineers put the machinery out of order when they left,of railroad officials caught by the workers in the act of cripplinglocomotives....A large section of the propertied classes preferred the Germans tothe Revolution-even to the Provisional Government-and didn't hesitateto say so. In the Russian household where I lived, the subject ofconversation at the dinner table was almost invariably the coming ofthe Germans, bringing "law and order."... One evening I spent at thehouse of a Moscow merchant; during tea we asked the eleven people atthe table whether they preferred "Wilhelm or the Bolsheviki." Thevote was ten to one for Wilhelm...The speculators took advantage of the universal disorganisation topile up fortunes, and to spend them in fantastic revelry or thecorruption of Government officials. Foodstuffs and fuel were hoarded,or secretly sent out of the country to Sweden. In the first fourmonths of the Revolution, for example, the reserve food-supplies werealmost openly looted from the great Municipal warehouses ofPetrograd, until the two-years' provision of grain had fallen to lessthan enough to feed the city for one month.... According to theofficial report of the last Minister of Supplies in the ProvisionalGovernment, coffee was bought wholesale in Vladivostok for two rublesa pound, and the consumer in Petrograd paid thirteen. In all thestores of the large cities were tons of food and clothing; but onlythe rich could buy them.In a provincial town I knew a merchant family turnedspeculator_-maradior_ (bandit, ghoul) the Russians call it. The threesons had bribed their way out of military service. One gambled infoodstuffs. Another sold illegal gold from the Lena mines tomysterious parties in Finland. The third owned a controlling interestin a chocolate factory, which supplied the local Cooperativesocieties-on condition that the Cooperatives furnished him everythinghe needed. And so, while the masses of the people got a quarter poundof black bread on their bread cards, he had an abundance of whitebread, sugar, tea, candy, cake and butter.... Yet when the soldiers atthe front could no longer fight from cold, hunger and exhaustion, howindignantly did this family scream "Cowards!"-how "ashamed" they were"to be Russians"... When finally the Bolsheviki found and requisitionedvast hoarded stores of provisions, what "Robbers" they were.Beneath all this external rottenness moved the old-time Dark Forces,unchanged since the fall of Nicholas the Second, secret still andvery active. The agents of the notorious _Okhrana_ still functioned,for and against the Tsar, for and against Kerensky-whoever wouldpay.... In the darkness, underground organisations of all sorts, suchas the Black Hundreds, were busy attempting to restore reaction insome form or other.In this atmosphere of corruption, of monstrous half-truths, one clearnote sounded day after day, the deepening chorus of the Bolsheviki,"All Power to the Soviets! All power to the direct representatives ofmillions on millions of common workers, soldiers, peasants. Land,bread, an end to the senseless war, an end to secret diplomacy,speculation, treachery.... The Revolution is in danger, and with it thecause of the people all over the world!"The struggle between the proletariat and the middle class, betweenthe Soviets and the Government, which had begun in the first Marchdays, was about to culminate. Having at one bound leaped from theMiddle Ages into the twentieth century, Russia showed the startledworld two systems of Revolution-the political and the social-inmortal combat.What a revelation of the vitality of the Russian Revolution, afterall these months of starvation and disillusionment! The bourgeoisieshould have better known its Russia. Not for a long time in Russiawill the "sickness" of Revolution have run its course....Looking back, Russia before the November insurrection seems ofanother age, almost incredibly conservative. So quickly did we adaptourselves to the newer, swifter life; just as Russian politics swungbodily to the Left-until the Cadets were outlawed as "enemies of thepeople," Kerensky became a "counter-revolutionist," the "middle"Socialist leaders, Tseretelli, Dan, Lieber, Gotz and Avksentiev, weretoo reactionary for their following, and men like Victor Tchernov,and even Maxim Gorky, belonged to the Right Wing....About the middle of December, 1917, a group of SocialistRevolutionary leaders paid a private visit to Sir George Buchanan,the British Ambassador, and implored him not to mention the fact thatthey had been there, because they were "considered too far Right.""And to think," said Sir George. "One year ago my Governmentinstructed me not to receive Miliukov, because he was so dangerouslyLeft!"September and October are the worst months of the Russianyear-especially the Petrograd year. Under dull grey skies, in theshortening days, the rain fell drenching, incessant. The mudunderfoot was deep, slippery and clinging, tracked everywhere byheavy boots, and worse than usual because of the complete break-downof the Municipal administration. Bitter damp winds rushed in from theGulf of Finland, and the chill fog rolled through the streets. Atnight, for motives of economy as well as fear of Zeppelins, thestreet-lights were few and far between; in private dwellings andapartment-houses the electricity was turned on from six o'clock untilmidnight, with candles forty cents apiece and little kerosene to behad. It was dark from three in the afternoon to ten in the morning.Robberies and housebreakings increased. In apartment houses the mentook turns at all-night guard duty, armed with loaded rifles. Thiswas under the Provisional Government.Week by week food became scarcer. The daily allowance of bread fellfrom a pound and a half to a pound, then three quarters, half, and aquarter-pound. Toward the end there was a week without any bread atall. Sugar one was entitled to at the rate of two pounds a month-ifone could get it at all, which was seldom. A bar of chocolate or apound of tasteless candy cost anywhere from seven to ten rubles-atleast a dollar. There was milk for about half the babies in the city;most hotels and private houses never saw it for months. In the fruitseason apples and pears sold for a little less than a ruble apiece onthe street-corner....For milk and bread and sugar and tobacco one had to stand in _queue_long hours in the chill rain. Coming home from an all-night meeting Ihave seen the _kvost_ (tail) beginning to form before dawn, mostlywomen, some with babies in their arms.... Carlyle, in his _FrenchRevolution,_ has described the French people as distinguished aboveall others by their faculty of standing in _queue._ Russia hadaccustomed herself to the practice, begun in the reign of Nicholasthe Blessed as long ago as 1915, and from then continuedintermittently until the summer of 1917, when it settled down as theregular order of things. Think of the poorly-clad people standing onthe iron-white streets of Petrograd whole days in the Russian winter!I have listened in the bread-lines, hearing the bitter, acrid note ofdiscontent which from time to time burst up through the miraculousgoodnature of the Russian crowd....Of course all the theatres were going every night, including Sundays.Karsavina appeared in a new Ballet at the Marinsky, all dance-lovingRussia coming to see her. Shaliapin was singing. At the Alexandrinskythey were reviving Meyerhold's production of Tolstoy's "Death of Ivanthe Terrible"; and at that performance I remember noticing a studentof the Imperial School of Pages, in his dress uniform, who stood upcorrectly between the acts and faced the empty Imperial box, with itseagles all erased.... The _Krivoye Zerkalo_ staged a sumptuous versionof Schnitzler's "Reigen."Although the Hermitage and other picture galleries had been evacuatedto Moscow, there were weekly exhibitions of paintings. Hordes of thefemale _intelligentzia_ went to hear lectures on Art, Literature andthe Easy Philosophies. It was a particularly active season forTheosophists. And the Salvation Army, admitted to Russia for thefirst time in history, plastered the walls with announcements ofgospel meetings, which amused and astounded Russian audiences....As in all such times, the petty conventional life of the city wenton, ignoring the Revolution as much as possible. The poets madeverses-but not about the Revolution. The realistic painters paintedscenes from mediæval Russian history-anything but the Revolution.Young ladies from the provinces came up to the capital to learnFrench and cultivate their voices, and the gay young beautifulofficers wore their gold-trimmed crimson _bashliki_ and theirelaborate Caucasian swords around the hotel lobbies. The ladies ofthe minor bureaucratic set took tea with each other in the afternoon,carrying each her little gold or silver or jewelled sugar-box, andhalf a loaf of bread in her muff, and wished that the Tsar were back,or that the Germans would come, or anything that would solve theservant problem.... The daughter of a friend of mine came home oneafternoon in hysterics because the woman street-car conductor hadcalled her "Comrade!"All around them great Russia was in travail, bearing a new world. Theservants one used to treat like animals and pay next to nothing, weregetting independent. A pair of shoes cost more than a hundred rubles,and as wages averaged about thirty-five rubles a month the servantsrefused to stand in _queue_ and wear out their shoes. But more thanthat. In the new Russia every man and woman could vote; there wereworking-class newspapers, saying new and startling things; there werethe Soviets; and there were the Unions. The _izvoshtchiki_(cab-drivers) had a Union; they were also represented in thePetrograd Soviet. The waiters and hotel servants were organised, andrefused tips. On the walls of restaurants they put up signs whichread, "No tips taken here-" or, "Just because a man has to make hisliving waiting on table is no reason to insult him by offering him atip!"At the Front the soldiers fought out their fight with the officers,and learned self-government through their committees. In thefactories those unique Russian organisations, the Factory-ShopCommittees, [*] gained experience and strength and a realisation of[* See Notes and Explanations]their historical mission by combat with the old order. All Russia waslearning to read, and _reading-_politics, economics, history-becausethe people wanted to _know...._ In every city, in most towns, along theFront, each political faction had its newspaper-sometimes several.Hundreds of thousands of pamphlets were distributed by thousands oforganisations, and poured into the armies, the villages, thefactories, the streets. The thirst for education, so long thwarted,burst with the Revolution into a frenzy of expression. From SmolnyInstitute alone, the first six months, went out every day tons,car-loads, train-loads of literature, saturating the land. Russiaabsorbed reading matter like hot sand drinks water, insatiable. Andit was not fables, falsified history, diluted religion, and the cheapfiction that corrupts-but social and economic theories, philosophy,the works of Tolstoy, Gogol, and Gorky....Then the Talk, beside which Carlyle's "flood of French speech" was amere trickle. Lectures, debates, speeches-in theatres, circuses,school-houses, clubs, Soviet meeting-rooms, Union headquarters,barracks.... Meetings in the trenches at the Front, in village squares,factories.... What a marvellous sight to see Putilovsky Zavod (thePutilov factory) pour out its forty thousand to listen to SocialDemocrats, Socialist Revolutionaries, Anarchists, anybody, whateverthey had to say, as long as they would talk! For months in Petrograd,and all over Russia, every street-corner was a public tribune. Inrailway trains, street-cars, always the spurting up of impromptudebate, everywhere....And the All-Russian Conferences and Congresses, drawing together themen of two continents-conventions of Soviets, of Cooperatives,Zemstvos, [*] nationalities, priests, peasants, political parties; the[* See Notes and Explanations]Democratic Conference, the Moscow Conference, the Council of theRussian Republic. There were always three or four conventions goingon in Petrograd. At every meeting, attempts to limit the time ofspeakers voted down, and every man free to express the thought thatwas in him....We came down to the front of the Twelfth Army, back of Riga, wheregaunt and bootless men sickened in the mud of desperate trenches; andwhen they saw us they started up, with their pinched faces and theflesh showing blue through their torn clothing, demanding eagerly,"Did you bring anything to _read?"_What though the outward and visible signs of change were many, whatthough the statue of Catharine the Great before the AlexandrinskyTheatre bore a little red flag in its hand, and others-somewhatfaded-floated from all public buildings; and the Imperial monogramsand eagles were either torn down or covered up; and in place of thefierce _gorodovoye_ (city police) a mild-mannered and unarmed citizenmilitia patrolled the streets-still, there were many quaintanachronisms.For example, Peter the Great's _Tabel o Rangov-_Table of Ranks-whichhe rivetted upon Russia with an iron hand, still held sway. Almosteverybody from the school-boy up wore his prescribed uniform, withthe insignia of the Emperor on button and shoulder-strap. Along aboutfive o'clock in the afternoon the streets were full of subdued oldgentlemen in uniform, with portfolios, going home from work in thehuge, barrack-like Ministries or Government institutions, calculatingperhaps how great a mortality among their superiors would advancethem to the coveted _tchin_ (rank) of Collegiate Assessor, or PrivyCouncillor, with the prospect of retirement on a comfortable pension,and possibly the Cross of St. Anne....There is the story of Senator Sokolov, who in full tide of Revolutioncame to a meeting of the Senate one day in civilian clothes, and wasnot admitted because he did not wear the prescribed livery of theTsar's service!It was against this background of a whole nation in ferment anddisintegration that the pageant of the Rising of the Russian Massesunrolled....                              Chapter II                          The Coming StormIN September General Kornilov marched on Petrograd to make himselfmilitary dictator of Russia. Behind him was suddenly revealed themailed fist of the bourgeoisie, boldly attempting to crush theRevolution. Some of the Socialist Ministers were implicated; evenKerensky was under suspicion. (See App. II, Sect. 1) Savinkov,summoned to explain to the Central Committee of his party, theSocialist Revolutionaries, refused and was expelled. Kornilov wasarrested by the Soldiers' Committees. Generals were dismissed,Ministers suspended from their functions, and the Cabinet fell.Kerensky tried to form a new Government, including the Cadets, partyof the bourgeoisie. His party, the Socialist Revolutionaries,ordered him to exclude the Cadets. Kerensky declined to obey, andthreatened to resign from the Cabinet if the Socialists insisted.However, popular feeling ran so high that for the moment he did notdare oppose it, and a temporary Directorate of Five of the oldMinisters, with Kerensky at the head, assumed the power until thequestion should be settled.The Kornilov affair drew together all the Socialistgroups-"moderates" as well as revolutionists-in a passionate impulseof self-defence. There must be no more Kornilovs. A new Governmentmust be created, responsible to the elements supporting theRevolution. So the _Tsay-ee-kah_ invited the popular organisationsto send delegates to a Democratic Conference, which should meet atPetrograd in September.In the _Tsay-ee-kah_ three factions immediately appeared. TheBolsheviki demanded that the All-Russian Congress of Soviets besummoned, and that they take over the power. The "centre" SocialistRevolutionaries, led by Tchernov, joined with the Left SocialistRevolutionaries, led by Kamkov and Spiridonova, the MenshevikiInternationalists under Martov, and the "centre" Mensheviki, [*][* See Notes and Explanations.]represented by Bogdanov and Skobeliev, in demanding a purelySocialist Government. Tseretelli, Dan and Lieber, at the head of theright wing Mensheviki, and the right Socialist Revolutionaries underAvksentiev and Gotz, insisted that the propertied classes must berepresented in the new Government.Almost immediately the Bolsheviki won a majority in the PetrogradSoviet, and the Soviets of Moscow, Kiev, Odessa and other citiesfollowed suit.Alarmed, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries in control ofthe _Tsay-ee-kah_ decided that after all they feared the danger ofKornilov less than the danger of Lenin. They revised the plan ofrepresentation in the Democratic Conference, (See App. II, Sect. 2)admitting more delegates from the Cooperative Societies and otherconservative bodies. Even this packed assembly at first voted for a_Coalition Government without the Cadets._ Only Kerensky's openthreat of resignation, and the alarming cries of the "moderate"Socialists that "the Republic is in danger" persuaded theConference, by a small majority, to declare in favour of theprinciple of coalition with the bourgeoisie, and to sanction theestablishment of a sort of consultative Parliament, without anylegislative power, called the Provisional Council of the RussianRepublic. In the new Ministry the propertied classes practicallycontrolled, and in the Council of the Russian Republic they occupieda disproportionate number of seats.The fact is that the _Tsay-ee-kah_ no longer represented the rankand file of the Soviets, and had illegally refused to call anotherAll-Russian Congress of Soviets, due in September. It had nointention of calling this Congress or of allowing it to be called.Its official organ, _Izviestia_ (News), began to hint that thefunction of the Soviets was nearly at an end, (See App. II, Sect. 3)and that they might soon be dissolved... At this time, too, the newGovernment announced as part of its policy the liquidation of"irresponsible organisations"-i.e. the Soviets.The Bolsheviki responded by summoning the All-Russian Soviets tomeet at Petrograd on November 2, and take over the Government ofRussia. At the same time they withdrew from the Council of theRussian Republic, stating that they would not participate in a"Government of Treason to the People." (See App. II, Sect. 4)The withdrawal of the Bolsheviki, however, did not bringtranquillity to the ill-fated Council. The propertied classes, nowin a position of power, became arrogant. The Cadets declared thatthe Government had no legal right to declare Russia a republic. Theydemanded stern measures in the Army and Navy to destroy theSoldiers' and Sailors' Committees, and denounced the Soviets. On theother side of the chamber the Mensheviki Internationalists and theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries advocated immediate peace, land tothe peasants, and workers' control of industry-practically theBolshevik programme.I heard Martov's speech in answer to the Cadets. Stooped over thedesk of the tribune like the mortally sick man he was, and speakingin a voice so hoarse it could hardly be heard, he shook his fingertoward the right benches:"You call us defeatists; but the real defeatists are those who waitfor a more propitious moment to conclude peace, insist uponpostponing peace until later, until nothing is left of the Russianarmy, until Russia becomes the subject of bargaining between thedifferent imperialist groups.... You are trying to impose upon theRussian people a policy dictated by the interests of thebourgeoisie. The question of peace should be raised without delay....You will see then that not in vain has been the work of those whomyou call German agents, of those Zimmerwaldists [*] who in all the[* Members of the revoloutionary internationalist wing of theSocialists of Europe, so-called because of their participationin the International Conference held at Zimmerwald, Switzerland,in 1915]lands have prepared the awakening of the conscience of thedemocratic masses...."Between these two groups the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries wavered, irresistibly forced to the left by thepressure of the rising dissatisfaction of the masses. Deep hostilitydivided the chamber into irreconcilable groups.This was the situation when the long-awaited announcement of theAllied Conference in Paris brought up the burning question offoreign policy....Theoretically all Socialist parties in Russia were in favour of theearliest possible peace on democratic terms. As long ago as May,1917, the Petrograd Soviet, then under control of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries,had proclaimed the famous Russianpeace-conditions. They had demanded that the Allies hold aconference to discuss war-aims. This conference had been promisedfor August; then postponed until September; then until October; andnow it was fixed for November 10th.The Provisional Government suggested two representatives-GeneralAlexeyev, reactionary military man, and Terestchenko, Minister ofForeign Affairs. The Soviets chose Skobeliev to speak for them anddrew up a manifesto, the famous _nakaz_- (See App. II, Sect. 5)instructions. The Provisional Government  objected to Skobeliev andhis _nakaz;_ the Allied ambassadors protested and finally Bonar Lawin the British House of Commons, in answer to a question, respondedcoldly, "As far as I know the Paris Conference will not discuss theaims of the war at all, but only the methods of conducting it...."At this the conservative Russian press was jubilant, and theBolsheviki cried, "See where the compromising tactics of theMensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries have led them!"Along a thousand miles of front the millions of men in Russia'sarmies stirred like the sea rising, pouring into the capital theirhundreds upon hundreds of delegations, crying "Peace! Peace!"I went across the river to the Cirque Moderne, to one of the greatpopular meetings which occurred all over the city, more numerousnight after night. The bare, gloomy amphitheatre, lit by five tinylights hanging from a thin wire, was packed from the ring up thesteep sweep of grimy benches to the very roof-soldiers, sailors,workmen, women, all listening as if their lives depended upon it. Asoldier was speaking-from the Five Hundred and Forty-eight Division,wherever and whatever that was:"Comrades," he cried, and there was real anguish in his drawn faceand despairing gestures. "The people at the top are always callingupon us to sacrifice more, sacrifice more, while those who haveeverything are left unmolested."We are at war with Germany. Would we invite German generals toserve on our Staff? Well we're at war with the capitalists too, andyet we invite them into our Government...."The soldier says, 'Show me what I am fighting for. Is itConstantinople, or is it free Russia? Is it the democracy, or is itthe capitalist plunderers? If you can prove to me that I amdefending the Revolution then I'll go out and fight without capitalpunishment to force me.'"When the land belongs to the peasants, and the factories to theworkers, and the power to the Soviets, then we'll know we havesomething to fight for, and we'll fight for it!"In the barracks, the factories, on the street-corners, end lesssoldier speakers, all clamouring for an end to the war, declaringthat if the Government did not make an energetic effort to getpeace, the army would leave the trenches and go home.The spokesman for the Eighth Army:"We are weak, we have only a few men left in each company. They mustgive us food and boots and reinforcements, or soon there will beleft only empty trenches. Peace or supplies... either let theGovernment end the war or support the Army...."For the Forty-sixth Siberian Artillery:"The officers will not work with our Committees, they betray us tothe enemy, they apply the death penalty to our agitators; and thecounter-revolutionary Government supports them. We thought that theRevolution would bring peace. But now the Government forbids us evento talk of such things, and at the same time doesn't give us enoughfood to live on, or enough ammunition to fight with...."From Europe came rumours of peace at the expense of Russia. (SeeApp. II, Sect. 6)...News of the treatment of Russian troops in France added to thediscontent. The First Brigade had tried to replace its officers withSoldiers' Committees, like their comrades at home, and had refusedan order to go to Salonika, demanding to be sent to Russia. They hadbeen surrounded and starved, and then fired on by artillery, andmany killed. (See App. II, Sect. 7)...On October 29th I went to the white-marble and crimson hall of theMarinsky palace, where the Council of the Republic sat, to hearTerestchenko's declaration of the Government's foreign policy,awaited with such terrible anxiety by all the peace-thirsty andexhausted land.A tall, impeccably-dressed young man with a smooth face and highcheek-bones, suavely reading his careful, non-committal speech. (SeeApp. II, Sect. 8) Nothing.... Only the same platitudes about crushingGerman militarism with the help of the Allies-about the "stateinterests" of Russia, about the "embarrassment" caused bySkobeliev's _nakaz._ He ended with the key-note:"Russia is a great power. Russia will remain a great power, whateverhappens. We must all defend her, we must show that we are defendersof a great ideal, and children of a great power."Nobody was satisfied. The reactionaries wanted a "strong"imperialist policy; the democratic parties wanted an assurance thatthe Government would press for peace.... I reproduce an editorial in_Rabotchi i Soldat_ (Worker and Soldier), organ of the BolshevikPetrograd Soviet:THE GOVERNMENT'S ANSWER TO THE TRENCHESThe most taciturn of our Ministers, Mr. Terestchenko, has actuallytold the trenches the following:1. We are closely united with our Allies. (Not with the peoples, butwith the Governments.)2. There is no use for the democracy to discuss the possibility orimpossibility of a winter campaign. That will be decided by theGovernments of our Allies.3. The 1st of July offensive was beneficial and a very happy affair.(He did not mention the consequences.)4. It is not true that our Allies do not care about us. The Ministerhas in his possession very important declarations. (Declarations?What about deeds? What about the behaviour of the British fleet?(See App. II, Sect. 9) The parleying of the British king with exiledcounter-revolutionary General Gurko? The Minister did not mentionall this.)5. The _nakaz_ to Skobeliev is bad; the Allies don't like it and theRussian diplomats don't like it. In the Allied Conference we mustall 'speak one language.'And is that all? That is all. What is the way out? The solution is,faith in the Allies and in Terestchenko. When will peace come? Whenthe Allies permit.That is how the Government replied to the trenches about peace!Now in the background of Russian politics began to form the vagueoutlines of a sinister power-the Cossacks. _Novaya Zhizn_ (NewLife), Gorky's paper, called attention to their activities:At the beginning of the Revolution the Cossacks refused to shootdown the people. When Kornilov marched on Petrograd they refused tofollow him. From passive loyalty to the Revolution the Cossacks havepassed to an active political offensive (against it). From theback-ground of the Revolution they have suddenly advanced to thefront of the stage....Kaledin, _ataman_ of the Don Cossacks, had been dismissed by theProvisional Government for his complicity in the Kornilov affair. Heflatly refused to resign, and surrounded by three immense Cossackarmies lay at Novotcherkask, plotting and menacing. So great was hispower that the Government was forced to ignore his insubordination.More than that, it was compelled formally to recognise the Councilof the Union of Cossack Armies, and to declare illegal thenewly-formed Cossack Section of the Soviets....In the first part of October a Cossack delegation called uponKerensky, arrogantly insisting that the charges against Kaledin bedropped, and reproaching the Minister-President for yielding to theSoviets. Kerensky agreed to let Kaledin alone, and then is reportedto have said, "In the eyes of the Soviet leaders I am a despot and atyrant.... As for the Provisional Government, not only does it notdepend upon the Soviets, but it considers it regrettable that theyexist at all."At the same time another Cossack mission called upon the Britishambassador, treating with him boldly as representatives of "the freeCossack people."In the Don something very like a Cossack Republic had beenestablished. The Kuban declared itself an independent Cossack State.The Soviets of Rostov-on-Don and Yekaterinburg were dispersed byarmed Cossacks, and the headquarters of the Coal Miners' Union atKharkov raided. In all its manifestations the Cossack movement wasanti-Socialist and militaristic. Its leaders were nobles and greatland-owners, like Kaledin, Kornilov, Generals Dutov, Karaulov andBardizhe, and it was backed by the powerful merchants and bankers ofMoscow....Old Russia was rapidly breaking up. In Ukraine, in Finland, Poland,White Russia, the nationalist movements gathered strength and becamebolder. The local Governments, controlled by the propertied classes,claimed autonomy, refusing to obey orders from Petrograd. AtHelsingfors the Finnish Senate declined to loan money to theProvisional Government, declared Finland autonomous, and demandedthe withdrawal of Russian troops. The bourgeois Rada at Kievextended the boundaries of Ukraine until they included all therichest agricultural lands of South Russia, as far east as theUrals, and began the formation of a national army. PremierVinnitchenko hinted at a separate peace with Germany-and theProvisional Government was helpless. Siberia, the Caucasus, demandedseparate Constituent Assemblies. And in all these countries therewas the beginning of a bitter struggle between the authorities andthe local Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies....Conditions were daily more chaotic. Hundreds of thousands ofsoldiers were deserting the front and beginning to move in vast,aimless tides over the face of the land. The peasants of Tambov andTver Governments, tired of waiting for the land, exasperated by therepressive measures of the Government, were burning manor-houses andmassacring land-owners. Immense strikes and lock-outs convulsedMoscow, Odessa and the coal-mines of the Don. Transportation wasparalysed; the army was starving and in the big cities there was nobread.The Government, torn between the democratic and reactionaryfactions, could do nothing: when forced to act it always supportedthe interests of the propertied classes. Cossacks were sent torestore order among the peasants, to break the strikes. In Tashkent,Government authorities suppressed the Soviet. In Petrograd theEconomic Council, established to rebuild the shattered economic lifeof the country, came to a deadlock between the opposing forces ofcapital and labour, and was dissolved by Kerensky. The old régimemilitary men, backed by Cadets, demanded that harsh measures beadopted to restore discipline in the Army and the Navy. In vainAdmiral Verderevsky, the venerable Minister of Marine, and GeneralVerkhovsky, Minister of War, insisted that only a new, voluntary,democratic discipline, based on cooperation with the soldiers' andsailors' Committees, could save the army and navy. Theirrecommendations were ignored.The reactionaries seemed determined to provoke popular anger. Thetrial of Kornilov was coming on. More and more openly the bourgeoispress defended him, speaking of him as "the great Russian patriot."Burtzev's paper, _Obshtchee Dielo_ (Common Cause), called for adictatorship of Kornilov, Kaledin and Kerensky!I had a talk with Burtzev one day in the press gallery of theCouncil of the Republic. A small, stooped figure with a wrinkledface, eyes near-sighted behind thick glasses, untidy hair and beardstreaked with grey."Mark my words, young man! What Russia needs is a Strong Man. Weshould get our minds off the Revolution now and concentrate on theGermans. Bunglers, bunglers, to defeat Kornilov; and back of thebunglers are the German agents. Kornilov should have won...."On the extreme right the organs of the scarcely-veiled Monarchists,Purishkevitch's _Narodny Tribun_ (People's Tribune), _Novaya Rus_(New Russia), and _Zhivoye Slovo_ (Living Word), openly advocatedthe extermination of the revolutionary democracy....On the 23rd of October occurred the naval battle with a Germansquadron in the Gulf of Riga. On the pretext that Petrograd was indanger, the Provisional Government drew up plans for evacuating thecapital. First the great munitions works were to go, distributedwidely throughout Russia; and then the Government itself was to moveto Moscow. Instantly the Bolsheviki began to cry out that theGovernment was abandoning the Red Capital in order to weaken theRevolution. Riga had been sold to the Germans; now Petrograd wasbeing betrayed!The bourgeois press was joyful. "At Moscow," said the Cadet paper_Ryetch_ (Speech), "the Government can pursue its work in a tranquilatmosphere, without being interfered with by anarchists." Rodzianko,leader of the right wing of the Cadet party, declared in _UtroRossii_ (The Morning of Russia) that the taking of Petrograd by theGermans would be a blessing, because it would destroy the Sovietsand get rid of the revolutionary Baltic Fleet:Petrograd is in danger (he wrote). I say to myself, "Let God takecare of Petrograd." They fear that if Petrograd is lost the centralrevolutionary organisations will be destroyed. To that I answer thatI rejoice if all these organisations are destroyed; for they willbring nothing but disaster upon Russia....With the taking of Petrograd the Baltic Fleet will also bedestroyed.... But there will be nothing to regret; most of thebattleships are completely demoralised....In the face of a storm of popular disapproval the plan of evacuationwas repudiated.Meanwhile the Congress of Soviets loomed over Russia like athunder-cloud, shot through with lightnings. It was opposed, notonly by the Government but by all the "moderate" Socialists. TheCentral Army and Fleet Committees, the Central Committees of some ofthe Trade Unions, the Peasants' Soviets, but most of all the_Tsay-ee-kah_ itself, spared no pains to prevent the meeting._Izviestia_ and _Golos Soldata_ (Voice of the Soldier), newspapersfounded by the Petrograd Soviet but now in the hands of the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ fiercely assailed it, as did the entire artillery ofthe Socialist Revolutionary party press, _Dielo Naroda_ (People'sCause) and _Volia Naroda_ (People's Will).Delegates were sent through the country, messages flashed by wire tocommittees in charge of local Soviets, to Army Committees,instructing them to halt or delay elections to the Congress. Solemnpublic resolutions against the Congress, declarations that thedemocracy was opposed to the meeting so near the date of theConstituent Assembly, representatives from the Front, from the Unionof Zemstvos, the Peasants' Union, Union of Cossack Armies, Union ofOfficers, Knights of St. George, Death Battalions, [*] protesting....[*See Notes and Explanations.]The Council of the Russian Republic was one chorus of disapproval.The entire machinery set up by the Russian Revolution of Marchfunctioned to block the Congress of Soviets....On the other hand was the shapeless will of the proletariat-theworkmen, common soldiers and poor peasants. Many local Soviets werealready Bolshevik; then there were the organisations of theindustrial workers, the _Fabritchno-Zavodskiye Comitieti-_Factory-Shop Committees; and the insurgent Army and Fleetorganisations. In some places the people, prevented from electingtheir regular Soviet delegates, held rump meetings and chose one oftheir number to go to Petrograd. In others they smashed the oldobstructionist committees and formed new ones. A ground-swell ofrevolt heaved and cracked the crust which had been slowly hardeningon the surface of revolutionary fires dormant all those months. Onlyan spontaneous mass-movement could bring about the All-RussianCongress of Soviets....Day after day the Bolshevik orators toured the barracks andfactories, violently denouncing "this Government of civil war." OneSunday we went, on a top-heavy steam tram that lumbered throughoceans of mud, between stark factories and immense churches, to_Obukhovsky Zavod,_ a Government munitions-plant out on theSchlüsselburg Prospekt.The meeting took place between the gaunt brick walls of a hugeunfinished building, ten thousand black-clothed men and women packedaround a scaffolding draped in red, people heaped on piles of lumberand bricks, perched high upon shadowy girders, intent andthunder-voiced. Through the dull, heavy sky now and again burst thesun, flooding reddish light through the skeleton windows upon themass of simple faces upturned to us.Lunatcharsky, a slight, student-like figure with the sensitive faceof an artist, was telling why the power must be taken by theSoviets. Nothing else could guarantee the Revolution against itsenemies, who were deliberately ruining the country, ruining thearmy, creating opportunities for a new Konilov.A soldier from the Rumanian front, thin, tragical and fierce, cried,"Comrades! We are starving at the front, we are stiff with cold. Weare dying for no reason. I ask the American comrades to carry wordto America, that the Russians will never give up their Revolutionuntil they die. We will hold the fort with all our strength untilthe peoples of the world rise and help us! Tell the American workersto rise and fight for the Social Revolution!"Then came Petrovsky, slight, slow-voiced, implacable: "Now is thetime for deeds, not words. The economic situation is bad, but wemust get used to it. They are trying to starve us and freeze us.They are trying to provoke us. But let them know that they can gotoo far-that if they dare to lay their hands upon the organisationsof the proletariat we will sweep them away like scum from the faceof the earth!"The Bolshevik press suddenly expanded. Besides the two party papers,_Rabotchi Put_ and _Soldat_ (Soldier), there appeared a new paperfor the peasants, _Derevenskaya Byednota_ (Village Poorest), pouredout in a daily half-million edition; and on October 17th, _Rabotchii Soldat._ Its leading article summed up the Bolshevik point of view:The fourth year's campaign will mean the annihilation of the armyand the country.... There is danger for the safety of Petrograd....Counter-revolutionists rejoice in the people's misfortunes.... Thepeasants brought to desperation come out in open rebellion; thelandlords and Government authorities massacre them with punitiveexpeditions; factories and mines are closing down, workmen arethreatened with starvation.... The bourgeoisie and its Generals wantto restore a blind discipline in the army.... Supported by thebourgeoisie, the Kornilovtsi are openly getting ready to break upthe meeting of the Constituent Assembly....The Kerensky Government is against the people. He will destroy thecountry.... This paper stands for the people and by the people-thepoor classes, workers, soldiers and peasants. The people can only besaved by the completion of the Revolution... and for this purpose thefull power must be in the hands of the Soviets....This paper advocates the following: All power to the Soviets-both inthe capital and in the provinces.Immediate truce on all fronts. An honest peace between peoples.Landlord estates-without compensation-to the peasants.Workers' control over industrial production.A faithfully and honestly elected Constituent Assembly.It is interesting to reproduce here a passage from that samepaper-the organ of those Bolsheviki so well known to the world asGerman agents:The German kaiser, covered with the blood of millions of deadpeople, wants to push his army against Petrograd. Let us call to theGerman workmen, soldiers and peasants, who want peace not less thanwe do, to... stand up against this damned war!This can be done only by a revolutionary Government, which wouldspeak really for the workmen, soldiers and peasants of Russia, andwould appeal over the heads of the diplomats directly to the Germantroops, fill the German trenches with proclamations in the Germanlanguage.... Our airmen would spread these proclamations all overGermany....In the Council of the Republic the gulf between the two sides of thechamber deepened day by day."The propertied classes," cried Karelin, for the Left SocialistRevolutionaries, "want to exploit the revolutionary machine of theState to bind Russia to the war-chariot of the Allies! Therevolutionary parties are absolutely against this policy...."Old Nicholas Tchaikovsky, representing the Populist Socialists,spoke against giving the land to the peasants, and took the side ofthe Cadets: "We must have immediately strong discipline in thearmy.... Since the beginning of the war I have not ceased to insistthat it is a crime to undertake social and economic reforms inwar-time. We are committing that crime, and yet I am not the enemyof these reforms, because I am a Socialist."Cries from the Left, "We don't believe you!" Mighty applause fromthe Right....Adzhemov, for the Cadets, declared that there was no necessity totell the army what it was fighting for, since every soldier ought torealise that the first task was to drive the enemy from Russianterritory.Kerensky himself came twice, to plead passionately for nationalunity, once bursting into tears at the end. The assembly heard himcoldly, interrupting with ironical remarks.Smolny Institute, headquarters of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and of thePetrograd Soviet, lay miles out on the edge of the city, beside thewide Neva. I went there on a street-car, moving snail-like with agroaning noise through the cobbled, muddy streets, and jammed withpeople. At the end of the line rose the graceful smoke-blue cupolasof Smolny Convent outlined in dull gold, beautiful; and beside itthe great barracks like façade of Smolny Institute, two hundredyards long and three lofty stories high, the Imperial arms carvedhugely in stone still insolent over the entrance....Under the old régime a famous convent-school for the daughters ofthe Russian nobility, patronised by the Tsarina herself, theInstitute had been taken over by the revolutionary organisations ofworkers and soldiers. Within were more than a hundred huge rooms,white and bare, on their doors enamelled plaques still informing thepasserby that within was "Ladies' Class-room Number 4" or "Teachers'Bureau"; but over these hung crudely-lettered signs, evidence of thevitality of the new order: "Central Committee of the PetrogradSoviet" and _"Tsay-ee-kah"_ and "Bureau of Foreign Affairs"; "Unionof Socialist Soldiers," "Central Committee of the All-Russian TradeUnions," "Factory-Shop Committees," "Central Army Committee"; andthe central offices and caucus-rooms of the political parties....The long, vaulted corridors, lit by rare electric lights, werethronged with hurrying shapes of soldiers and workmen, some bentunder the weight of huge bundles of newspapers, proclamations,printed propaganda of all sorts. The sound of their heavy boots madea deep and incessant thunder on the wooden floor.... Signs were postedup everywhere: "Comrades! For the sake of your health, preservecleanliness!" Long tables stood at the head of the stairs on everyfloor, and on the landings, heaped with pamphlets and the literatureof the different political parties, for sale....The spacious, low-ceilinged refectory downstairs was still adining-room. For two rubles I bought a ticket entitling me todinner, and stood in line with a thousand others, waiting to get tothe long serving-tables, where twenty men and women were ladlingfrom immense cauldrons cabbage soup, hunks of meat and piles of_kasha,_ slabs of black bread. Five kopeks paid for tea in a tincup. From a basket one grabbed a greasy wooden spoon.... The benchesalong the wooden tables were packed with hungry proletarians,wolfing their food, plotting, shouting rough jokes across the room....[Graphic page-33 -- text of placard in russian, translation follows]COMRADESFOR THE SAKE OF YOUR HEALTH,PRESERVE CLEANLINESS.Upstairs was another eating-place, reserved for the _Tsay-ee-kah-_though every one went there. Here could be had bread thicklybuttered and endless glasses of tea....In the south wing on the second floor was the great hall ofmeetings, the former ball-room of the Institute. A lofty white roomlighted by glazed-white chandeliers holding hundreds of ornateelectric bulbs, and divided by two rows of massive columns; at oneend a dais, flanked with two tall many-branched light standards, anda gold frame behind, from which the Imperial portrait had been cut.Here on festal occasions had been banked brilliant military andecclesiastical uniforms, a setting for Grand Duchesses....Just across the hall outside was the office of the CredentialsCommittee for the Congress of Soviets. I stood there watching thenew delegates come in-burly, bearded soldiers, workmen in blackblouses, a few long-haired peasants. The girl in charge-a member ofPlekhanov's _Yedinstvo_ [*] group-smiled contemptuously. "These are[* See Notes and Explanations]very different people from the delegates to the first _Siezd_(Congress)," she remarked. "See how rough and ignorant they look!The Dark People...." It was true; the depths of Russia had beenstirred, and it was the bottom which came uppermost now. TheCredentials Committee, appointed by the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ waschallenging delegate after delegate, on the ground that they hadbeen illegally elected. Karakhan, member of the Bolshevik CentralCommittee, simply grinned. "Never mind," he said, "When the timecomes we'll see that you get your seats...."_Rabotchi i Soldat_ said:The attention of delegates to the new All-Russian Congress is calledto attempts of certain members of the Organising Committee to breakup the Congress, by asserting that it will not take place, and thatdelegates had better leave Petrograd.... Pay no attention to theselies.... Great days are coming....It was evident that a quorum would not come together by November 2,so the opening of the Congress was postponed to the 7th. But thewhole country was now aroused; and the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries, realising that they were defeated, suddenly changedtheir tactics and began to wire frantically to their provincialorganisations to elect as many "moderate" Socialist delegates aspossible. At the same time the Executive Committee of the Peasants'Soviets issued an emergency call for a Peasants' Congress, to meetDecember 13th and offset whatever action the workers and soldiersmight take...What would the Bolsheviki do? Rumours ran through the city thatthere would be an armed "demonstration," a _vystuplennie_-"comingout" of the workers and soldiers. The bourgeois and reactionarypress prophesied insurrection, and urged the Government to arrestthe Petrograd Soviet, or at least to prevent the meeting of theCongress. Such sheets as _Novaya Rus_ advocated a general Bolshevikmassacre.Gorky's paper, _Novaya Zhizn,_ agreed with the Bolsheviki that thereactionaries were attempting to destroy the Revolution, and that ifnecessary they must be resisted by force of arms; but all theparties of the revolutionary democracy must present a united front.As long as the democracy has not organised its principal forces, solong as the resistance to its influence is still strong, there is noadvantage in passing to the attack. But if the hostile elementsappeal to force, then the revolutionary democracy should enter thebattle to seize the power, and it will be sustained by the mostprofound strata of the people....Gorky pointed out that both reactionary and Government newspaperswere inciting the Bolsheviki to violence. An insurrection, however,would prepare the way for a new Kornilov. He urged the Bolsheviki todeny the rumours. Potressov, in the Menshevik _Dien_ (Day),published a sensational story, accompanied by a map, which professedto reveal the secret Bolshevik plan of campaign.As if by magic, the walls were covered with warnings, (See App. II,Sect. 10) proclamations, appeals, from the Central Committees of the"moderate" and conservative factions and the _Tsay-ee-kah,_denouncing any "demonstrations," imploring the workers and soldiersnot to listen to agitators. For instance, this from the MilitarySection of the Socialist Revolutionary party:Again rumours are spreading around the town of an intended_vystuplennie._ What is the source of these rumours? Whatorganisation authorises these agitators who preach insurrection? TheBolsheviki, to a question addressed to them in the _Tsay-ee-kah,_denied that they have anything to do with it.... But these rumoursthemselves carry with them a great danger. It may easily happenthat, not taking into consideration the state of mind of themajority of the workers, soldiers and peasants, individual hot-headswill call out part of the workers and soldiers on the streets,inciting them to an uprising.... In this fearful time through whichrevolutionary Russia is passing, any insurrection can easily turninto civil war, and there can result from it the destruction of allorganisations of the proletariat, built up with so much labour.... Thecounter-revolutionary plotters are planning to take advantage ofthis insurrection to destroy the Revolution, open the front toWilhelm, and wreck the Constituent Assembly.... Stick stubbornly toyour posts! Do not come out!On October 28th, in the corridors of Smolny, I spoke with Kameniev,a little man with a reddish pointed beard and Gallic gestures. Hewas not at all sure that enough delegates would come. "If there _is_a Congress," he said, "it will represent the overwhelming sentimentof the people. If the majority is Bolshevik, as I think it will be,we shall demand that the power be given to the Soviets, and theProvisional Government must resign...."Volodarsky, a tall, pale youth with glasses and a bad complexion,was more definite. "The 'Lieber-Dans' and the other compromisers aresabotaging the Congress. If they succeed in preventing itsmeeting,-well, then we are realists enough not to depend on _that!"_Under date of October 29th I find entered in my notebook thefollowing items culled from the newspapers of the day:Moghilev (General Staff Headquarters). Concentration here of loyalGuard Regiments, the Savage Division, Cossacks and Death Battalions.The _yunkers_ of the Officers' Schools of Pavlovsk, Tsarskoye Seloand Peterhof ordered by the Government to be ready to come toPetrograd. Oranienbaum _yunkers_ arrive in the city.Part of the Armoured Car Division of the Petrograd garrism stationedin the Winter Palace.Upon orders signed by Trotzky, several thousand rifles delivered bythe Government Arms Factory at Sestroretzk to delegates of thePetrograd workmen.At a meeting of the City Militia of the Lower Liteiny Quarter, aresolution demanding that all power be given to the Soviets.This is just a sample of the confused events of those feverish days,when everybody knew that something was going to happen, but nobodyknew just what.At a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet in Smolny, the night of October30th, Trotzky branded the assertions of the bourgeois press that theSoviet contemplated armed insurention as "an attempt of thereactionaries to discredit and wreck the Congress of Soviets.... ThePetrograd Soviet," he declared, "had not ordered any _uystuplennie._If it is necessary we shall do so, and we will be supported by thePetrogruad garrison.... They (the Government) are preparing acounter-revolution; and we shall answer with an offensive which willbe merciless and decisive."It is true that the Petrograd Soviet had not ordered ademonstration, but the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party wasconsidering the question of insurrection. All night long the 23dthey met. There were present all the party intellectuals, theleaders-and delegates of the Petrograd workers and garrison. Aloneof the intellectuals Lenin and Trotzky stood for insurrection. Even   urrection. Even   |          |the military men opposed it. A vote was taken. Insurrection wasdefeated!Then arose a rough workman, his face convulsed with rage. "I speakfor the Petrograd proletariat," he said, harshly. "We are in favourof insurrection. Have it your own way, but I tell you now that ifyou allow the Soviets to be destroyed, _we're through with you!"_Some soldiers joined him.... And after that they votedagain-insurrection won....However, the right wing of the Bolsheviki, led by Riazanov, Kamenievand Zinoviev, continued to campaign against an armed rising. On themorning of October 31st appeared in _Rabotchi Put_ the firstinstalment of Lenin's "Letter to the Comrades," (See App. II, Sect.11) one of the most audacious pieces of political propaganda theworld has ever seen. In it Lenin seriously presented the argumentsin favour of insurrection, taking as text the objections of Kamenievand Riazonov."Either we must abandon our slogan, 'All Power to the Soviets,' " hewrote, "or else we must make an insurrection. There is no middlecourse...."That same afternoon Paul Miliukov, leader of the Cadets, made abrilliant, bitter speech (See App. II, Sect. 12) in the Council ofthe Republic, branding the Skobeliev _nakaz_ as pro-German,declaring that the "revolutionary democracy" was destroying Russia,sneering at Terestchenko, and openly declaring that he preferredGerman diplomacy to Russian.... The Left benches were one roaringtumult all through....On its part the Government could not ignore the significance of thesuccess of the Bolshevik propaganda. On the 29th joint commission ofthe Government and the Council of the Republic hastily drew up twolaws, one for giving the land temporarily to the peasants, and theother for pushing an energetic foreign policy of peace. The next dayKerensky suspended capital punishment in the army. That sameafternoon was opened with great ceremony the first session of thenew "Commission for Strengthening the Republican Régime and FightingAgainst Anarchy and Counter-Revolution"-of which history shows notthe slightest further trace.... The following morning with two othercorrespondents I interviewed Kerensky (See App. II, Sect. 13)-thelast time he received journalists."The Russian people," he said, bitterly, "are suffering fromeconomic fatigue-and from disillusionment with the Allies! The worldthinks that the Russian Revolution is at an end. Do not be mistaken.The Russian Revolution is just beginning...." Words more prophetic,perhaps, than he knew.Stormy was the all-night meeting of the Petrograd Soviet the 30th ofOctober, at which I was present. The "moderate" Socialistintellectuals, officers, members of Army Committees, the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ were there in force. Against them rose up workmen,peasants and common soldiers, passionate and simple.A peasant told of the disorders in Tver, which he said were causedby the arrest of the Land Committees. "This Kerensky is nothing buta shield to the _pomieshtchiki_ (landowners)," he cried. "They knowthat at the Constituent Assembly we will take the land anyway, sothey are trying to destroy the Constituent Assembly!"A machinist from the Putilov works described how the superintendentswere closing down the departments one by one on the pretext thatthere was no fuel or raw materials. The Factory-Shop Committee, hedeclared, had discovered huge hidden supplies."It is a _provocatzia,"_ said he. "They want to starve us-or driveus to violence!"Among the soldiers one began, "Comrades! I bring you greetings fromthe place where men are digging their graves and call them trenches!"Then arose a tall, gaunt young soldier, with flashing eyes, met witha roar of welcome. It was Tchudnovsky, reported killed in the Julyfighting, and now risen from the dead."The soldier masses no longer trust their officers. Even the ArmyCommittees, who refused to call a meeting of our Soviet, betrayedus.... The masses of the soldiers want the Constituent Assembly to beheld exactly when it was called for, and those who dare to postponeit will be cursed-and not only platonic curses either, for the Armyhas guns too...."He told of the electoral campaign for the Constituent now raging inthe Fifth Army. "The officers, and especially the Mensheviki and theSocialist Revolutionaries, are trying deliberately to cripple theBolsheviki. Our papers are not allowed to circulate in the trenches.Our speakers are arrested-""Why don't you speak about the lack of bread?" shouted anothersoldier."Man shall not live by bread alone," answered Tchudnovsky, sternly....Followed him an officer, delegate from the Vitebsk Soviet, aMenshevik _oboronetz._ "It isn't the question of who has the power.The trouble is not with the Government, but with the war.... and thewar must be won before any change-" At this, hoots and ironicalcheers. "These Bolshevik agitators are demagogues!" The hall rockedwith laughter. "Let us for a moment forget the class struggle-" Buthe got no farther. A voice yelled, "Don't you wish we would!"Petrograd presented a curious spectacle in those days. In thefactories the committe-rooms were filled with stacks of rifles,couriers came and went, the Red Guard [*] drilled.... In all the[* See Notes and Explanations]barracks meetings every night, and all day long interminable hotarguments. On the streets the crowds thickened toward gloomyevening, pouring in slow voluble tides up and down the Nevsky,fighting for the newspapers.... Hold-ups increased to such an extentthat it was dangerous to walk down side streets.... On the Sadovayaone afternoon I saw a crowd of several hundred people beat andtrample to death a soldier caught stealing.... Mysterious individualscirculated around the shivering women who waited in _queue_ longcold hours for bread and milk, whispering that the Jews had corneredthe food supply-and that while the people starved, the Sovietmembers lived luxuriously....At Smolny there were strict guards at the door and the outer gates,demanding everybody's pass. The committee-rooms buzzed and hummedall day and all night, hundreds of soldiers and workmen slept on thefloor, wherever they could find room. Upstairs in the great hall athousand people crowded to the uproarious sessions of the PetrogradSoviet....Gambling clubs functioned hectically from dusk to dawn, withchampagne flowing and stakes of twenty thousand rubles. In thecentre of the city at night prostitutes in jewels and expensive furswalked up and down, crowded the cafés....Monarchist plots, German spies, smugglers hatching schemes....And in the rain, the bitter chill, the great throbbing city undergrey skies rushing faster and faster toward-what?                              Chapter III                              On the EveIN the relations of a weak Government and a rebellious people therecomes a time when every act of the authorities exasperates themasses, and every refusal to act excites their contempt....The proposal to abandon Petrograd raised a hurricane; Kerensky'spublic denial that the Government had any such intention was met withhoots of derision.Pinned to the wall by the pressure of the Revolution (cried _RabotchiPut),_ the Government of "provisional" bourgeois tries to get free bygiving out lying assurances that it never thought of fleeing fromPetrograd, and that it didn't wish to surrender the capital....In Kharkov thirty thousand coal miners organised, adopting thepreamble of the I. W. W. constitution: "The working class and theemploying class have nothing in common." Dispersed by Cossacks, somewere locked out by the mine-owners, and the rest declared a generalstrike. Minister of Commerce and Industry Konovalov appointed hisassistant, Orlov, with plenary powers, to settle the trouble. Orlovwas hated by the miners. But the _Tsay-ee-kah_ not only supported hisappointment, but refused to demand that the Cossacks be recalled fromthe Don Basin....This was followed by the dispersal of the Soviet at Kaluga. TheBolsheviki, having secured a majority in the Soviet, set free somepolitical prisoners. With the sanction of the Government Commissarthe Municipal Duma called in troops from Minsk, and bombarded theSoviet headquarters with artillery. The Bolsheviki yielded, but asthey left the building Cossacks attacked them, crying, "This is whatwe'll do to all the other Bolshevik Soviets, including those ofMoscow and Petrograd!" This incident sent a wave of panic ragethroughout Russia....In Petrograd was ending a regional Congress of Soviets of the North,presided over by the Bolshevik Krylenko. By an immense majority itresolved that all power should be assumed by the All-RussianCongress; and concluded by greeting the Bolsheviki in prison, biddingthem rejoice, for the hour of their liberation was at hand. At thesame time the first All-Russian Conference of Factory-Shop Committees(See App. III, Sect. 1) declared emphatically for the Soviets, andcontinued significantly,After liberating themselves politically from Tsardom, theworking-class wants to see the democratic régime triumphant in thesphere of its productive activity. This is best expressed by Workers'Control over industrial production, which naturally arose in theatmosphere of economic decomposition created by the criminal policyof the dominating classes....The Union of Railwaymen was demanding the resignation of Liverovsky,Minister of Ways and Communications....In the name of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ Skobeliev insisted that the _nakaz_be presented at the Allied Conference, and formally protested againstthe sending of Terestchenko to Paris. Terestchenko offered to resign....General Verkhovsky, unable to accomplish his reorganisation of thearmy, only came to Cabinet meetings at long intervals....On November 3d Burtzev's _Obshtchee Dielo_ came out with greatheadlines:Citizens! Save the fatherland!I have just learned that yesterday, at a meeting of the Commissionfor National Defence, Minister of War General Verkhovsky, one of theprincipal persons responsible for the fall of Kornilov, proposed tosign a separate peace, independently of the Allies.That is treason to Russia!Terestchenko declared that the Provisional Government had not evenexamined Verkhovsky's proposition."You might think," said Terestchenko, "that we were in a madhouse!"The members of the Commission were astounded at the General's words.General Alexeyev wept.No! It is not madness! It is worse. It is direct treason to Russia!Kerensky, Terestchenko and Nekrassov must immediately answer usconcerning the words of Verkhovsky.Citizens, arise!Russia is being sold!Save her!What Verkhovsky really said was that the Allies must be pressed tooffer peace, because the Russian army could fight no longer....Both in Russia and abroad the sensation was tremendous. Verkhovskywas given "indefinite leave of absence for illhealth," and left theGovernment. _Obshtchee Dielo_ was suppressed....Sunday, November 4th, was designated as the Day of the PetrogradSoviet, with immense meetings planned all over the city, ostensiblyto raise money for the organisation and the press; really, to make ademonstration of strength. Suddenly it was announced that on the sameday the Cossacks would hold a _Krestny Khod_-Procession of theCross-in honour of the Ikon of 1612, through whose miraculousintervention Napoleon had been driven from Moscow. The atmosphere waselectric; a spark might kindle civil war. The Petrograd Soviet issueda manifesto, headed "Brothers-Cossacks!"You, Cossacks, are being incited against us, workers and soldiers.This plan of Cain is being put into operation by our common enemies,the oppressors, the privileged classes-generals, bankers, landlords,former officials, former servants of the Tsar.... We are hated by allgrafters, rich men, princes, nobles, generals, including your Cossackgenerals. They are ready at any moment to destroy the PetrogradSoviet and crush the Revolution....On the 4th of November somebody is organising a Cossack religiousprocession. It is a question of the free consciousness of everyindividual whether he will or will not take part in this procession.We do not interfere in this matter, nor do we obstruct anybody....However, we warn you, Cossacks! Look out and see to it that under thepretext of a _Krestni Khod,_ your Kaledins do not instigate youagainst workmen, against soldiers....The procession was hastily called off....In the barracks and the working-class quarters of the town theBolsheviki were preaching, "All Power to the Soviets!" and agents ofthe Dark Forces were urging the people to rise and slaughter theJews, shop-keepers, Socialist leaders....On one side the Monarchist press, inciting to bloody repression-onthe other Lenin's great voice roaring, "Insurrection!.... We cannotwait any longer!"Even the bourgeois press was uneasy. (See App. III, Sect. 2)_Birjevya Viedomosti_ (Exchange Gazette) called the Bolshevikpropaganda an attack on "the most elementary principles ofsociety-personal security and the respect for private property."[Graphic page-46 Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet]Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet to the Cosacks to call off their_Krestny Khod_-the religious procession planned for November 4th (ourcalendar). "Brothers-Cossacks!" it begins. "The Petrograd Soviet ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies addresses you."But it was the "moderate" Socialist journals which were the mosthostile. (See App. III, Sect. 3) "The Bolsheviki are the mostdangerous enemies of the Revolution," declared _Dielo Naroda._ Saidthe Menshevik _Dien,_ "The Government ought to defend itself anddefend us." Plekhanov's paper, _Yedinstvo_ (Unity) (See App. III,Sect. 4), called the attention of the Government to the fact that thePetrograd workers were being armed, and demanded stern measuresagainst the Bolsheviki.Daily the Government seemed to become more helpless. Even theMunicipal administration broke down. The columns of the morningpapers were filled with accounts of the most audacious robberies andmurders, and the criminals were unmolested.On the other hand armed workers patrolled the streets at night, doingbattle with marauders and requisitioning arms wherever they foundthem.On the first of November Colonel Polkovnikov, Military Commander ofPetrograd, issued a proclamation:Despite the difficult days through which the country is passing,irresponsible appeals to armed demonstrations and massacres are stillbeing spread around Petrograd, and from day to day robbery anddisorder increase.This state of things is disorganising the life of the citizens, andhinders the systematic work of the Government and the MunicipalInstitutions.In full consciousness of my responsibility and my duty before mycountry, I command:1. Every military unit, in accordance with special instructions andwithin the territory of its garrison, to afford every assistance tothe Municipality, to the Commissars, and to the militia, in theguarding of Government institutions.2. The organisation of patrols, in co-operation with the DistrictCommander and the representatives of the city militia, and the takingof measures for the arrest of criminals and deserters.3. The arrest of all persons entering barracks and inciting to armeddemonstrations and massacres, and their delivery to the headquartersof the Second Commander of the city.4. To suppress any armed demonstration or riot at its start, with allarmed forces at hand.5. To afford assistance to the Commissars in preventing unwarrantedsearches in houses and unwarranted arrests.6. To report immediately all that happens in the district undercharge to the Staff of the Petrograd Military District.I call upon all Army Committees and organisations to afford theirhelp to the commanders in fulfilment of the duties with which theyare charged.In the Council of the Republic Kerensky declared that the Governmentwas fully aware of the Bolshevik preparations, and had sufficientforce to cope with any demonstration. (See App. III, Sect. 5) Heaccused _Novaya Rus_ and _Robotchi Put_ of both doing the same kindof subversive work. "But owing to the absolute freedom of the press,"he added, "the Government is not in a position to combat printedlies. [*]...." Declaring that these were two aspects of the same[* This was not quite candid.  The Provisional Gevernment hadsuppressed Bolshevik papers before, in July, and was planning todo so again.]propaganda, which had for its object the counter-revolution, soardently desired by the Dark Forces, he went on:"I am a doomed man, it doesn't matter what happens to me, and I havethe audacity to say that the other enigmatic part is that of theunbelievable provocation created in the city by the Bolsheviki!"On November 2d only fifteen delegates to the Congress of Soviets hadarrived. Next day there were a hundred, and the morning after that ahundred and seventy-five, of whom one hundred and three wereBolsheviki.... Four hundred constituted a quorum, and the Congress wasonly three days off....I spent a great deal of time at Smolny. It was no longer easy to getin. Double rows of sentries guarded the outer gates, and once insidethe front door there was a long line of people waiting to be let in,four at a time, to be questioned as to their identity and theirbusiness. Passes were given out, and the pass system was changedevery few hours; for spies continually sneaked through....[Graphic page-49  Russian Pass to Reed, translation follows]Pass to Smolny Institute, issued by the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, giving me the right of entry at any time.

Commandant                               AdjutantOne day as I came up to the outer gate I saw Trotzky and his wifejust ahead of me. They were halted by a soldier. Trotzky searchedthrough his pockets, but could find no pass."Never mind," he said finally. "You know me. My name is Trotzky.""You haven't got a pass," answered the soldier stubbornly."You cannot go in. Names don't mean anything to me.""But I am the president of the Petrograd Soviet.""Well," replied the soldier, "if you're as important a fellow as thatyou must at least have one little paper."Trotzky was very patient. "Let me see the Commandant," he said. Thesoldier hesitated, grumbling something about not wanting to disturbthe Commandant for every devil that came along. He beckoned finallyto the soldier in command of the guard. Trotzky explained matters tohim. "My name is Trotzky," he repeated."Trotzky?" The other soldier scratched his head. "I've heard the namesomewhere," he said at length. "I guess it's all right. You can go onin, comrade...."In the corridor I met Karakhan, member of the Bolshevik CentralCommittee, who explained to me what the new Government would be like."A loose organisation, sensitive to the popular will as expressedthrough the Soviets, allowing local forces full play. At present theProvisional Government obstructs the action of the local democraticwill, just as the Tsar's Government did. The initiative of the newsociety shall come from below.... The form of the Government will bemodelled on the Constitution of the Russian Social Democratic LabourParty. The new _Tsay-ee-kah,_ responsible to frequent meetings of theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets, will be the parliament; the variousMinistries will be headed by _collegia_-committees-instead of byMinisters, and will be directly responsible to the Soviets....On October 30th, by appointment, I went up to a small, bare room inthe attic of Smolny, to talk with Trotzky. In the middle of the roomhe sat on a rough chair at a bare table. Few questions from me werenecessary; he talked rapidly and steadily, for more than an hour. Thesubstance of his talk, in his own words, I give here:"The Provisional Government is absolutely powerless. The bourgeoisieis in control, but this control is masked by a fictitious coalitionwith the _oborontsi_ parties. Now, during the Revolution, one seesrevolts of peasants who are tired of waiting for their promised land;and all over the country, in all the toiling classes, the samedisgust is evident. This domination by the bourgeoisie is onlypossible by means of civil war. The Kornilov method is the only wayby which the bourgeoisie can control. But it is force which thebourgeoisie lacks.... The Army is with us. The conciliators andpacifists, Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki, have lost allauthority-because the struggle between the peasants and thelandlords, between the workers and the employers, between thesoldiers and the officers, has become more bitter, moreirreconcilable than ever. Only by the concerted action of the popularmass, only by the victory of proletarian dictatorship, can theRevolution be achieved and the people saved...."The Soviets are the most perfect representatives of thepeople-perfect in their revolutionary experience, in their ideas andobjects. Based directly upon the army in the trenches, the workers inthe factories, and the peasants in the fields, they are the backboneof the Revolution."There has been an attempt to create a power without the Soviets-andonly powerlessness has been created. Counter-revolutionary schemes ofall sorts are now being hatched in the corridors of the Council ofthe Russian Republic. The Cadet party represents thecounter-revolution militant. On the other side, the Soviets representthe cause of the people. Between the two camps there are no groups ofserious importance.... It is the _lutte finale._ The bourgeoiscounter-revolution organises all its forces and waits for the momentto attack us. Our answer will be decisive. We will complete the workscarcely begun in March, and advanced during the Kornilov affair...."He went on to speak of the new Government's foreign policy:"Our first act will be to call for an immediate armistice on allfronts, and a conference of peoples to discuss democratic peaceterms. The quantity of democracy we get in the peace settlementdepends on the quantity of revolutionary response there is in Europe.If we create here a Government of the Soviets, that will be apowerful factor for immediate peace in Europe; for this Governmentwill address itself directly and immediately to all peoples, over theheads of their Governments, proposing an armistice. At the moment ofthe conclusion of peace the pressure of the Russian Revolution willbe in the direction of 'no annexations,# no indemnities, the right ofself-determination of peoples,' and a _Federated Republic of Europe._..."At the end of this war I see Europe recreated, not by the diplomats,but by the proletariat. The Federated Republic of Europe-the UnitedStates of Europe-that is what must be. National autonomy no longersuffices. Economic evolution demands the abolition of nationalfrontiers. If Europe is to remain split into national groups, thenImperialism will recommence its work. Only a Federated Republic ofEurope can give peace to the world." He smiled-that fine, faintlyironical smile of his. "But without the action of the Europeanmasses, these ends cannot be realised-now...."Now while everybody was waiting for the Bolsheviki to appear suddenlyon the streets one morning and begin to shoot down people with whitecollars on, the real insurrection took its way quite naturally andopenly.The Provisional Government planned to send the Petrograd garrison tothe front.The Petrograd garrison numbered about sixty thousand men, who hadtaken a prominent part in the Revolution. It was they who had turnedthe tide in the great days of March, created the Soviets of Soldiers'Deputies, and hurled back Kornilov from the gates of Petrograd.Now a large part of them were Bolsheviki. When the ProvisionalGovernment talked of evacuating the city, it was the Petrogradgarrison which answered, "If you are not capable of defending thecapital, conclude peace; if you cannot conclude peace, go away andmake room for a People's Government which can do both...."It was evident that any attempt at insurrection depended upon theattitude of the Petrograd garrison. The Government's plan was toreplace the garrison regiments with "dependable" troops-Cossacks,Death Battalions. The Army Committees, the "moderate" Socialists andthe _Tsay-ee-kah_ supported the Government. A wide-spread agitationwas carried on at the Front and in Petrograd, emphasizing the factthat for eight months the Petrograd garrison had been leading an easylife in the barracks of the capital, while their exhausted comradesin the trenches starved and died.Naturally there was some truth in the accusation that the garrisonregiments were reluctant to exchange their comparative comfort forthe hardships of a winter campaign. But there were other reasons whythey refused to go. The Petrograd Soviet feared the Government'sintentions, and from the Front came hundreds of delegates, chosen bythe common soldiers, crying, "It is true we need reinforcements, butmore important, we must know that Petrograd and the Revolution arewell-guarded.... Do you hold the rear, comrades, and we will hold thefront!"On October 25th, behind closed doors, the Central Committee of thePetrograd Soviet discussed the formation of a special MilitaryCommittee to decide the whole question. The next day a meeting of theSoldiers' Section of the Petrograd Soviet elected a Committee, whichimmediately proclaimed a boycott of the bourgeois newspapers, andcondemned the _Tsay-ee-kah_ for opposing the Congress of Soviets. Onthe 29th, in open session of the Petrograd Soviet, Trotzky proposedthat the Soviet formally sanction the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. "We ought," he said, "to create our special organisationto march to battle, and if necessary to die...." It was decided to sendto the front two delegations, one from the Soviet and one from thegarrison, to confer with the Soldiers' Committees and the GeneralStaff.At Pskov, the Soviet delegates were met by General Tcheremissov,commander of the Northern Front, with the curt declaration that hehad ordered the Petrograd garrison to the trenches, and that was all.The garrison committee was not allowed to leave Petrograd....A delegation of the Soldiers' Section of the Petrograd Soviet askedthat a representative be admitted to the Staff of the PetrogradDistrict. Refused. The Petrograd Soviet demanded that no orders beissued without the approval of the Soldiers' Section. Refused. Thedelegates were roughly told, "We only recognise the _Tsay-ee-kah._ Wedo not recognise you; if you break any laws, we shall arrest you."On the 30th a meeting of representatives of all the Petrogradregiments passed a resolution: _"The Petrograd garrison no longerrecognises the Provisional Government. The Petrograd Soviet is ourGovernment. We will obey only the orders of the Petrograd Soviet,through the Military Revolutionary Committee."_ The local militaryunits were ordered to wait for instructions from the Soldiers'Section of the Petrograd Soviet.Next day the _Tsay-ee-kah_ summoned its own meeting, composed largelyof officers, formed a Committee to cooperate with the Staff, anddetailed Commissars in all quarters of the city.A great soldier meeting at Smolny on the 3d resolved:Saluting the creation of the Military Revolutionary Committee, thePetrograd garrison promises it complete support in all its actions,to unite more closely the front and the rear in the interests of theRevolution.The garrison moreover declares that with the revolutionaryproletariat it assures the maintenance of revolutionary order inPetrograd. Every attempt at provocation on the part of theKornilovtsi or the bourgeoisie will be met with merciless resistance.Now conscious of its power, the Military Revolutionary Committeeperemptorily summoned the Petrograd Staff to submit to its control.To all printing plants it gave orders not to publish any appeals orproclamations without the Committee's authorisation. Armed Commissarsvisited the Kronversk arsenal and seized great quantities of arms andammunition, halting a shipment of ten thousand bayonets which wasbeing sent to Novotcherkask, headquarters of Kaledin....Suddenly awake to the danger, the Government offered immunity if theCommittee would disband. Too late. At midnight November 5th Kerenskyhimself sent Malevsky to offer the Petrograd Soviet representation onthe Staff. The Military Revolutionary Committee accepted. An hourlater General Manikovsky, acting Minister of war, countermanded theoffer....Tuesday morning, November 6th, the city was thrown into excitement bythe appearance of a placard signed, "Military Revolutionary Committeeattached to the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies."To the Population of Petrograd. Citizens!Counter-revolution has raised its criminal head. The Kornilovtsi aremobilising their forces in order to crush the All-Russian Congress ofSoviets and break the Constituent Assembly. At the same time the_pogromists_ may attempt to call upon the people of Petrograd fortrouble and bloodshed. The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies takes upon itself the guarding of revolutionary order in thecity against counter-revolutionary and _pogrom_ attempts.The Petrograd garrison will not allow any violence or disorders. Thepopulation is invited to arrest hooligans and Black Hundred agitatorsand take them to the Soviet Commissars at the nearest barracks. Atthe first attempt of the Dark Forces to make trouble on the streetsof Petrograd, whether robbery or fighting, the criminals will bewiped off the face of the earth!Citizens! We call upon you to maintain complete quiet andself-possession. The cause of order and Revolution is in strong hands.List of regiments where there are Commissars of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee....On the 3rd the leaders of the Bolsheviki had another historic meetingbehind closed doors. Notified by Zalkind, I waited in the corridoroutside the door; and Volodarsky as he came out told me what wasgoing on.Lenin spoke: "November 6th will be too early. We must have anall-Russian basis for the rising; and on the 6th all the delegates tothe Congress will not have arrived.... On the other hand, November 8thwill be too late. By that time the Congress will be organised, and itis difficult for a large organised body of people to take swift,decisive action. We must act on the 7th, the day the Congress meets,so that we may say to it, 'Here is the power! What are you going todo with it?'"In a certain upstairs room sat a thin-faced, long-haired individual,once an officer in the armies of the Tsar, then revolutionist andexile, a certain Avseenko, called Antonov, mathematician andchess-player; he was drawing careful plans for the seizure of thecapital.On its side the Government was preparing. Inconspicuously certain ofthe most loyal regiments, from widely-separated divisions, wereordered to Petrograd. The _yunker_ artillery was drawn into theWinter Palace. Patrols of Cossacks made their appearance in thestreets, for the first time since the July days. Polkovnikov issuedorder after order, threatening to repress all insubordination withthe "utmost energy." Kishkin, Minister of Public Instruction, theworsthated member of the Cabinet, was appointed Special Commissar tokeep order in Petrograd; he named as assistants two men no lessunpopular, Rutenburg and Paltchinsky. Petrograd, Cronstadt andFinland were declared in a state of siege-upon which the bourgeois_Novoye Vremya_ (New Times) remarked ironically:Why the state of siege? The Government is no longer a power. It hasno moral authority and it does not possess the necessary apparatus touse force.... In the most favourable circumstances it can onlynegotiate with any one who consents to parley. Its authority goes nofarther....Monday morning, the 5th, I dropped in at the Marinsky Palace, to seewhat was happening in the Council of the Russian Republic. Bitterdebate on Terestchenko's foreign policy. Echoes of theBurtzev-Verkhovski affair. All the diplomats present except theItalian ambassador, who everybody said was prostrated by the Carsodisaster....As I came in, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Karelin was readingaloud an editorial from the London _Times_ which said, "The remedyfor Bolshevism is bullets!" Turning to the Cadets he cried, "That'swhat _you_ think, too!"Voices from the Right, "Yes! Yes!""Yes, I know you think so," answered Karelin, hotly. "But you haven'tthe courage to try it!"Then Skobeliev, looking like a matinée idol with his soft blond beardand wavy yellow hair, rather apologetically defending the Soviet_nakaz._ Terestchenko followed, assailed from the Left by cries of"Resignation! Resignation!" He insisted that the delegates of theGovernment and of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ to Paris should have a commonpoint of view-his own. A few words about the restoration ofdiscipline in the army, about war to victory.... Tumult, and over thestubborn opposition of the truculent Left, the Council of theRepublic passed to the simple order of the day.There stretched the rows of Bolshevik seats-empty since that firstday when they left the Council, carrying with them so much life. As Iwent down the stairs it seemed to me that in spite of the bitterwrangling, no real voice from the rough world outside could penetratethis high, cold hall, and that the Provisional Government waswrecked-on the same rock of War and Peace that had wrecked theMiliukov Ministry.... The doorman grumbled as he put on my coat, "Idon't know what is becoming of poor Russia. All these Mensheviki andBolsheviki and Trudoviki.... This Ukraine and this Finland and theGerman imperialists and the English imperialists. I am forty-fiveyears old, and in all my life I never heard so many words as in thisplace...."In the corridor I met Professor Shatsky, a rat-faced individual in adapper frock-coat, very influential in the councils of the Cadetparty. I asked him what he thought of the much-talked-of Bolshevik_vystuplennie._ He shrugged, sneering."They are cattle-_canaille,"_ he answered. "They will not dare, or ifthey dare they will soon be sent flying. From our point of view itwill not be bad, for then they will ruin themselves and have no powerin the Constituent Assembly...."But, my dear sir, allow me to outline to you my plan for a form ofGovernment to be submitted to the Constituent Assembly. You see, I amchairman of a commission appointed from this body, in conjunctionwith the Provisional Government, to work out a constitutionalproject.... We will have a legislative assembly of two chambers, suchas you have in the United States. In the lower chamber will beterritorial representatives; in the upper, representatives of theliberal professions, zemstvos, Cooperatives-and Trade Unions...."Outside a chill, damp wind came from the west, and the cold mudunderfoot soaked through my shoes. Two companies of _yunkers_ passedswinging up the Morskaya, tramping stiffly in their long coats andsinging an oldtime crashing chorus, such as the soldiers used to singunder the Tsar.... At the first cross-street I noticed that the CityMilitiamen were mounted, and armed with revolvers in bright newholsters; a little group of people stood silently staring at them. Atthe corner of the Nevsky I bought a pamphlet by Lenin, "Will theBolsheviki be Able to Hold the Power?" paying for it with one of thestamps which did duty for small change. The usual street-cars crawledpast, citizens and soldiers clinging to the outside in a way to makeTheodore P. Shonts green with envy.... Along the sidewalk a row ofdeserters in uniform sold cigarettes and sunflower seeds....Up the Nevsky in the sour twilight crowds were battling for thelatest papers, and knots of people were trying to make out themultitudes of appeals (See App. III, Sect. 6) and proclamationspasted in every flat place; from the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the Peasants'Soviets, the "moderate" Socialist parties, the ArmyCommittees-threatening, cursing, beseeching the workers and soldiersto stay home, to support the Government....An armoured automobile went slowly up and down, siren screaming. Onevery corner, in every open space, thick groups were clustered;arguing soldiers and students. Night came swiftly down, thewide-spaced street-lights flickered on, the tides of people flowedendlessly.... It is always like that in Petrograd just before trouble....The city was nervous, starting at every sharp sound. But still nosign from the Bolsheviki; the soldiers stayed in the barracks, theworkmen in the factories.... We went to a moving picture show near theKazan Cathedral-a bloody Italian film of passion and intrigue. Downfront were some soldiers and sailors, staring at the screen inchildlike wonder, totally unable to comprehend why there should be somuch violent running about, and so much homicide....From there I hurried to Smolny. In room 10 on the top floor, theMilitary Revolutionary Committee sat in continuous session, under thechairmanship of a tow-headed, eighteen-year-old boy named Lazimir. Hestopped, as he passed, to shake hands rather bashfully."Peter-Paul Fortress has just come over to us," said he, with apleased grin. "A minute ago we got word from a regiment that wasordered by the Government to come to Petrograd. The men weresuspicious, so they stopped the train at Gatchina and sent adelegation to us. 'What's the matter?' they asked. 'What have you gotto say? We have just passed a resolution, "All Power to theSoviets."'... The Military Revolutionary Committee sent back word,'Brothers! We greet you in the name of the Revolution. Stay where youare until further instructions!'"All telephones, he said, were cut off: but communication with thefactories and barracks was established by means of militarytelephonograph apparatus....A steady stream of couriers and Commissars came and went. Outside thedoor waited a dozen volunteers, ready to carry word to the farthestquarters of the city. One of them, a gypsy-faced man in the uniformof a lieutenant, said in French, "Everything is ready to move at thepush of a button...."There passed Podvoisky, the thin, bearded civillian whose brainconceived the strategy of insurrection; Antonov, unshaven, his collarfilthy, drunk with loss of sleep; Krylenko, the squat, wide-facedsoldier, always smiling, with his violent gestures and tumblingspeech; and Dybenko, the giant bearded sailor with the placid face.These were the men of the hour-and of other hours to come.Downstairs in the office of the Factory-Shop Committees sat Seratov,signing orders on the Government Arsenal for arms-one hundred andfifty rifles for each factory.... Delegates waited in line, forty ofthem....In the hall I ran into some of the minor Bolshevik leaders. Oneshowed me a revolver. "The game is on," he said, and his face waspale. "Whether we move or not the other side knows it must finish usor be finished...."The Petrograd Soviet was meeting day and night. As I came into thegreat hall Trotzky was just finishing."We are asked," he said, "if we intend to have a _vystuplennie._ Ican give a clear answer to that question. The Petrograd Soviet feelsthat at last the moment has arrived when the power must fall into thehands of the Soviets. This transfer of government will beaccomplished by the All-Russian Congress. Whether an armeddemonstration is necessary will depend on... those who wish tointerfere with the All-Russian Congress...."We feel that our Government, entrusted to the personnel of theProvisional Cabinet, is a pitiful and helpless Government, which onlyawaits the sweep of the broom of History to give way to a reallypopular Government. But we are trying to avoid a conflict, even now,to-day. We hope that the All-Russian Congress will take... into itshands that power and authority which rests upon the organised freedomof the people. If, however, the Government wants to utilise the shortperiod it is expected to live-twenty-four, forty eight, orseventy-two hours-to attack us, then we shall answer withcounter-attacks, blow for blow, steel for iron!"Amid cheers he announced that the Left Socialist Revolutionaries hadagreed to send representatives into the Military RevolutionaryCommittee....As I left Smolny, at three o'clock in the morning, I noticed that tworapid-firing guns had been mounted, one on each side of the door, andthat strong patrols of soldiers guarded the gates and the near-bystreet-corners. Bill Shatov [*] came bounding up the steps. "Well," he[* Well known in the American labor movement.]cried, "We're off! Kerensky sent the _yunkers_ to close down ourpapers, _Soldat_ and _Rabotchi Put._ But our troops went down andsmashed the Government seals, and now we're sending detachments toseize the bourgeois newspaper offices!" Exultantly he slapped me onthe shoulder, and ran in....On the morning of the 6th I had business with the censor, whoseoffice was in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Everywhere, on all thewalls, hysterical appeals to the people to remain "calm." Polkovnikovemitted _prikaz_ after _prikaz:_I order all military units and detachments to remain in theirbarracks until further orders from the Staff of the MilitaryDistrict.... All officers who act without orders from their superiorswill be court-martialled for mutiny. I forbid absolutely anyexecution by soldiers of instructions from other organisations....The morning papers announced that the Government had suppressed thepapers _Novaya Rus, Zhivoye Slovo, Rabotchi Put_ and _Soldat,_ anddecreed the arrest of the leaders of the Petrograd Soviet and themembers of the Military Revolutionary Committee....As I crossed the Palace Square several batteries of _yunker_artillery came through the Red Arch at a jingling trot, and drew upbefore the Palace. The great red building of the General Staff wasunusually animated, several armoured automobiles ranked before thedoor, and motors full of officers were coming and going.... The censorwas very much excited, like a small boy at a circus. Kerensky, hesaid, had just gone to the Council of the Republic to offer hisresignation. I hurried down to the Marinsky Palace, arriving at theend of that passionate and almost incoherent speech of Kerensky's,full of self-justification and bitter denunciation of his enemies."I will cite here the most characteristic passage from a whole seriesof articles published in _Rabotchi Put_ by Ulianov-Lenin, a statecriminal who is in hiding and whom we are trying to find.... This statecriminal has invited the proletariat and the Petrograd garrison torepeat the experience of the 16th-18th of July, and insists upon theimmediate necessity for an armed rising.... Moreover, other Bolshevikleaders have taken the floor in a series of meetings, and also madean appeal to immediate insurrection. Particularly should be noticedthe activity of the present president of the Petrograd Soviet,Bronstein-Trotzky...."I ought to bring to your notice... that the expressions and the styleof a whole series of articles in _Rabotchi Put_ and _Soldat_ resembleabsolutely those of _Novaya Rus...._ We have to do not so much with themovement of such and such political party, as with the exploitationof the political ignorance and criminal instincts of a part of thepopulation, a sort of organisation whose object it is to provoke inRussia, cost what it may, an inconscient movement of destruction andpillage; for given the state of mind of the masses, any movement atPetrograd will be followed by the most terrible massacres, which willcover with eternal shame the name of free Russia...."... By the admission of Ulianov-Lenin himself, the situation of theextreme left wing of the Social Democrats in Russia is veryfavourable." (Here Kerensky read the following quotation from Lenin'sarticle.):Think of it!... The German comrades have only one Liebknecht, withoutnewspapers, without freedom of meeting, without a Soviet.... They areopposed by the incredible hostility of all classes of society-and yetthe German comrades try to act; while we, having dozens ofnewspapers, freedom of meeting, the majority of the Soviets, we, thebest-placed international proletarians of the entire world, can werefuse to support the German revolutionists and insurrectionaryorganisations?...Kerensky then continued:"The organisers of rebellion recognise thus implicitly that the mostperfect conditions for the free action of a political party obtainnow in Russia, administered by a Provisional Government at the headof which is, in the eyes of this party, 'a usurper and a man who hassold himself to the bourgeoisie, the Minister-President Kerensky....'"... The organisers of the insurrection do not come to the aid of theGerman proletariat, but of the German governing classes, and theyopen the Russian front to the iron fists of Wilhelm and his friends....Little matter to the Provisional Government the motives of thesepeople, little matter if they act consciously or unconsciously; butin any case, from this tribune, in full consciousness of myresponsibility, I quality such acts of a Russian political party asacts of treason to Russia!"... I place myself at the point of view of the Right, and I proposeimmediately to proceed to an investigation and make the necessaryarrests." (Uproar from the Left.) "Listen to me!" he cried in apowerful voice. "At the moment when the state is in danger, becauseof conscious or unconscious treason, the Provisional Government, andmyself among others, prefer to be killed rather than betray the life,the honour and the independence of Russia...."At this moment a paper was handed to Kerensky."I have just received the proclamation which they are distributing tothe regiments. Here is the contents." Reading: _"'The PetrogradSoviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies is menaced. We orderimmediately the regiments to mobilise on a war footing and to awaitnew orders. All delay or non-execution of this order will beconsidered as an act of treason to the Revolution. The MilitaryRevolutionary Committee. For the President, Podvoisky. The Secretary,Antonov.'_"In reality, this is an attempt to raise the populace against theexisting order of things, to break the Constituent and to open thefront to the regiments of the iron fist of Wilhelm...."I say 'populace' intentionally, because the conscious democracy andits _Tsay-ee-kah,_ all the Army organisations, all that free Russiaglorifies, the good sense, the honour and the conscience of the greatRussian democracy, protests against these things...."I have not come here with a prayer, but to state my firm convictionthat the Provisional Government, which defends at this moment our newliberty-that the new Russian state, destined to a brilliant future,will find unanimous support except among those who have never daredto face the truth...."... The Provisional Government has never violated the liberty of allcitizens of the State to use their political rights.... But now theProvisional Government.... declares: in this moment those elements ofthe Russian nation, those groups and parties who have dared to lifttheir hands against the free will of the Russian people, at the sametime threatening to open the front to Germany, must be liquidatedwith decision!..."Let the population of Petrograd understand that it will encounter afirm power, and perhaps at the last moment good sense, conscience andhonour will triumph in the hearts of those who still possess them...."All through this speech, the hall rang with deafening clamour. Whenthe Minister-President had stepped down, pale-faced and wet withperspiration, and strode out with his suite of officers, speakerafter speaker from the Left and Centre attacked the Right, all oneangry roaring. Even the Socialist Revolutionaries, through Gotz:"The policy of the Bolsheviki is demagogic and criminal, in theirexploitation of the popular discontent. But there is a whole seriesof popular demands which have received no satisfaction up to now....The questions of peace, land and the democratization of the armyought to be stated in such a fashion that no soldier, peasant orworker would have the least doubt that our Government is attempting,firmly and infallibly, to solve them...."We Mensheviki do not wish to provoke a Cabinet crisis, and we areready to defend the Provisional Government with all our energy, tothe last drop of our blood-if only the Provisional Government, on allthese burning questions, will speak the clear and precise wordsawaited by the people with such impatience...."Then Martov, furious:"The words of the Minister-President, who allowed himself to speak of'populace' when it is question of the movement of important sectionsof the proletariat and the army-although led in the wrongdirection-are nothing but an incitement to civil war."The order of the day proposed by the Left was voted. It amountedpractically to a vote of lack of confidence.1. The armed demonstration which has been preparing for some dayspast has for its object a _coup d'etat,_ threatens to provoke civilwar, creates conditions favourable to _pogroms_ andcounterrevolution, the mobilization of counter-revolutionary forces,such as the Black Hundreds, which will inevitably bring about theimpossibility of convoking the Constituent, will cause a militarycatastrophe, the death of the Revolution, paralyse the economic lifeof the country and destroy Russia;2. The conditions favourable to this agitation have been created bydelay in passing urgent measures, as well as objective conditionscaused by the war and the general disorder. It is necessary beforeeverything to promulgate at once a decree transmitting the land tothe peasants' Land Committees, and to adopt an energetic course ofaction abroad in proposing to the Allies to proclaim their peaceterms and to begin peace-parleys;3. To cope with Monarchist manifestations and _pogromist_ movements,it is indispensable to take immediate measures to suppress thesemovements, and for this purpose to create at Petrograd a Committee ofPublic Safety, composed of representatives of the Municipality andthe organs of the revolutionary democracy, acting in contact with theProvisional Government....It is interesting to note that the Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries all rallied to this resolution.... When Kerensky sawit, however, he summoned Avksentiev to the Winter Palace to explain.If it expressed a lack of confidence in the Provisional Government,he begged Avksentiev to form a new Cabinet. Dan, Gotz and Avksentiev,the leaders of the "compromisers," performed their last compromise....They explained to Kerensky that it was not meant as a criticism ofthe Government!At the corner of the Morskaya and the Nevsky, squads of soldiers withfixed bayonets were stopping all private automobiles, turning out theoccupants, and ordering them toward the Winter Palace. A large crowdhad gathered to watch them. Nobody knew whether the soldiers belongedto the Government or the Military Revolutionary Committee. Up infront of the Kazan Cathedral the same thing was happening, machinesbeing directed back up the Nevsky. Five or six sailors with riflescame along, laughing excitedly, and fell into conversation with twoof the soldiers. On the sailors' hat bands were _Avrora_ and _ZariaSvobody,_-the names of the leading Bolshevik cruisers of the BalticFleet. One of them said, "Cronstadt is coming!"... It was as if, in1792, on the streets of Paris, some one had said: "The Marseillaisare coming!" For at Cronstadt were twenty-five thousand sailors,convinced Bolsheviki and not afraid to die...._Rabotchi i Soldat_ was just out, all its front page one hugeproclamation: SOLDIERS! WORKERS! CITIZENS!The enemies of the people passed last night to the offensive. TheKornilovists of the Staff are trying to draw in from the suburbs_yunkers_ and volunteer battalions. The Oranienbaum _yunkers_ and theTsarskoye Selo volunteers refused to come out. A stroke of hightreason is being contemplated against the Petrograd Soviet.... Thecampaign of the counter-revolutionists is being directed against theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets on the eve of its opening, againstthe Constituent Assembly, against the people. The Petrograd Soviet isguarding the Revolution. The Military Revolutionary Committee isdirecting the repulse of the conspirators' attack. The entiregarrison and proletariat of Petrograd are ready to deal the enemy ofthe people a crushing blow.The Military Revolutionary Committee decrees:1. All regimental, division and battle-ship Committees, together withthe Soviet Commissars, and all revolutionary organisations, shallmeet in continuous session, concentrating in their hands allinformation about the plans of the conspirators.2. Not one soldier shall leave his division without permission of theCommittee.3. To send to Smolny at once two delegates from each military unitand five from each Ward Soviet.4. All members of the Petrograd Soviet and all delegates to theAll-Russian Congress are invited immediately to Smolny for anextraordinary meeting.Counter-revolution has raised its criminal head.A great danger threatens all the conquests and hopes of the soldiersand workers.But the forces of the Revolution by far exceed those of its enemies.The cause of the People is in strong hands. The conspirators will becrushed.No hesitation or doubts! Firmness, steadfastness, discipline,determination!Long live the Revolution!_The Military Revolutionary Committee._The Petrograd Soviet was meeting continuously at Smolny, a centre ofstorm, delegates falling down asleep on the floor and rising again totake part in the debate, Trotzky, Kameniev, Volodarsky speaking six,eight, twelve hours a day....I went down to room 18 on the first floor where the Bolshevikdelegates were holding caucus, a harsh voice steadily booming, thespeaker hidden by the crowd: "The compromisers say that we areisolated. Pay no attention to them. Once it begins they must bedragged along with us, or else lose their following...."Here he held up a piece of paper. "We are dragging them! A messagehas just come from the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries! Theysay that they condemn our action, but that if the Government attacksus they will not oppose the cause of the proletariat!" Exultantshouting....As night fell the great hall filled with soldiers and workmen, amonstrous dun mass, deep-humming in a blue haze of smoke. The old_Tsay-ee-kah_ had finally decided to welcome the delegates to thatnew Congress which would mean its own ruin-and perhaps the ruin ofthe revolutionary order it had built. At this meeting, however, onlymembers of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ could vote....It was after midnight when Gotz took the chair and Dan rose to speak,in a tense silence, which seemed to me almost menacing."The hours in which we live appear in the most tragic colours," hesaid. "The enemy is at the gates of Petrograd, the forces of thedemocracy are trying to organise to resist him, and yet we awaitbloodshed in the streets of the capital, and famine threatens todestroy, not only our homogeneous Government, but the Revolutionitself...."The masses are sick and exhausted. They have no interest in theRevolution. If the Bolsheviki start anything, that will be the end ofthe Revolution..." (Cries, "That's a lie!)" "The counter-revolutionistsare waiting with the Bolsheviki to begin riots and massacres.... Ifthere is any _vystuplennie,_ there will be no Constituent Assembly...."(Cries, "Lie! Shame!")"It is inadmissible that in the zone of military operations thePetrograd garrison shall not submit to the orders of the Staff.... Youmust obey the orders of the Staff and of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ elected byyou. All Power to the Soviets-that means death! Robbers and thievesare waiting for the moment to loot and burn.... When you have suchslogans put before you, 'Enter the houses, take away the shoes andclothes from the bourgeoisie-'" (Tumult. Cries, "No such slogan! Alie! A lie!") "Well, it may start differently, but it will end thatway!"The _Tsay-ee-kah_ has full power to act, and must be obeyed.... We arenot afraid of bayonets.... The _Tsay-ee-kah_ will defend the Revolutionwith its body...." (Cries, "It was a dead body long ago!")Immense continued uproar, in which his voice could be heardscreaming, as he pounded the desk, "Those who are urging this arecommitting a crime!"Voice: "You committed a crime long ago, when you captured the powerand turned it over to the bourgeoisie!"Gotz, ringing the chairman's bell: "Silence, or I'll have you putout!"Voice: "Try it!" (Cheers and whistling.)"Now concerning our policy about peace." (Laughter.) "UnfortunatelyRussia can no longer support the continuation of the war. There isgoing to be peace, but not permanent peace-not a democratic peace....To-day, at the Council of the Republic, in order to avoid bloodshed,we passed an order of the day demanding the surrender of the land tothe Land Committees and immediate peace negotiations...." (Laughter,and cries, "Too late!")Then for the Bolsheviki, Trotzky mounted the tribune, borne on a waveof roaring applause that burst into cheers and a rising house,thunderous. His thin, pointed face was positively Mephistophelian inits expression of malicious irony."Dan's tactics prove that the masses-the great, dull, indifferentmasses-are absolutely with him!" (Titantic mirth.) He turned towardthe chairman, dramatically. "When we spoke of giving the land to thepeasants, you were against it. We told the peasants, 'If they don'tgive it to you, take it yourselves!' and the peasants followed ouradvice. And now you advocate what we did six months ago...."I don't think Kerensky's order to suspend the death penalty in thearmy was dictated by his ideals. I think Kerensky was persuaded bythe Petrograd garrison, which refused to obey him...."To-day Dan is accused of having made a speech in the Council of theRepublic which proves him to be a secret Bolshevik.... The time maycome when Dan will say that the flower of the Revolution participatedin the rising of July 16th and 18th.... In Dan's resolution to-day atthe Council of the Republic there was no mention of enforcingdiscipline in the army, although that is urged in the propaganda ofhis party...."No. The history of the last seven months shows that the masses haveleft the Mensheviki. The Mensheviki and the Socialist Revolutionariesconquered the Cadets, and then when they got the power, they gave itto the Cadets...."Dan tells you that you have no right to make an insurrection.Insurrection is the right of all revolutionists! When thedown-trodden masses revolt, it is their right...."Then the long-faced, cruel-tongued Lieber, greeted with groans andlaughter."Engels and Marx said that the proletariat had no right to take poweruntil it was ready for it. In a bourgeois revolution like this.... theseizure of power by the masses means the tragic end of theRevolution.... Trotzky, as a Social Democratic theorist, is himselfopposed to what he is now advocating...." (Cries, "Enough! Down withhim!")Martov, constantly interrupted: "The Internationalists are notopposed to the transmission of power to the democracy, but theydisapprove of the methods of the Bolsheviki. This is not the momentto seize the power...."Again Dan took the floor, violently protesting against the action ofthe Military Revolutionary Committee, which had sent a Commissar toseize the office of _Izviestia_ and censor the paper. The wildestuproar followed. Martov tried to speak, but could not be heard.Delegates of the Army and the Baltic Fleet stood up all over thehall, shouting that the Soviet was _their_ Government....Amid the wildest confusion Ehrlich offered a resolution, appealing tothe workers and soldiers to remain calm and not to respond toprovocations to demonstrate, recognising the necessity of immediatelycreating a Committee of Public Safety, and asking the ProvisionalGovernment at once to pass decrees transferring the land to thepeasants and beginning peace negotiations....Then up leaped Volodarsky, shouting harshly that the _Tsay-ee-kah,_on the eve of the Congress, had no right to assume the functions ofthe Congress. The _Tsay-ee-kah_ was practically dead, he said, andthe resolution was simply a trick to bolster up its waning power...."As for us, Bolsheviki, we will not vote on this resolution!"Whereupon all the Bolsheviki left the hall and the resolution waspassed....Toward four in the morning I met Zorin in the outer hall, a rifleslung from his shoulder."We're moving!" (See App. III, Sect. 7) said he, calmly but withsatisfaction. "We pinched the Assistant Minister of Justice and theMinister of Religions. They're down cellar now. One regiment is onthe march to capture the Telephone Exchange, another the TelegraphAgency, another the State Bank. The Red Guard is out...."On the steps of Smolny, in the chill dark, we first saw the RedGuard-a huddled group of boys in workmen's clothes, carrying gunswith bayonets, talking nervously together.Far over the still roofs westward came the sound of scattered riflefire, where the _yunkers_ were trying to open the bridges over theNeva, to prevent the factory workers and soldiers of the Viborgquarter from joining the Soviet forces in the centre of the city; andthe Cronstadt sailors were closing them again....Behind us great Smolny, bright with lights, hummed like a gigantichive....                              Chapter IV                    The Fall of the Provisional GovernmentWEDNESDAY, November 7th, I rose very late. The noon cannon boomedfrom Peter-Paul as I went down the Nevsky. It was a raw, chill day.In front of the State Bank some soldiers with fixed bayonets werestanding at the closed gates."What side do you belong to?" I asked. "The Government?""No more Government," one answered with a grin, "_Slava Bogu!_ Gloryto God!" That was all I could get out of him....The street-cars were running on the Nevsky, men, women and smallboys hanging on every projection. Shops were open, and there seemedeven less uneasiness among the street crowds than there had been theday before. A whole crop of new appeals against insurrection hadblossomed out on the walls during the night-to the peasants, to thesoldiers at the front, to the workmen of Petrograd. One read:FROM THE PETROGRAD MUNICIPAL DUMA:The Municipal Duma informs the citizens that in the extraordinarymeeting of November 6th the Duma formed a Committee of PublicSafety, composed of members of the Central and Ward Dumas, andrepresentatives of the following revolutionary democraticorganizations: The _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the All-Russian ExecutiveCommittee of Peasant Deputies, the Army organisations, the_Tsentroflot,_ the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies (!), the Council of Trade Unions, and others.Members of the Committee of Public Safety will be on duty in thebuilding of the Municipal Duma. Telephones No. 15-40, 223-77, 138-36.November 7th, 1917.Though I didn't realize it then, this was the Duma's declaration ofwar against the Bolsheviki.I bought a copy of _Rabotchi Put,_ the only newspaper which seemedon sale, and a little later paid a soldier fifty kopeks for asecond-hand copy of _Dien._ The Bolshevik paper, printed onlarge-sized sheets in the conquered office of the _Russkaya Volia,_had huge headlines: "ALL POWER-TO THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS, SOLDIERSAND PEASANTS! PEACE! BREAD! LAND!" The leading article was signed"Zinoviev,"-Lenin's companion in hiding. It began:Every soldier, every worker, every real Socialist, every honestdemocrat realises that there are only two alternatives to thepresent situation.Either-the power will remain in the hands of the bourgeois-landlordcrew, and this will mean every kind of repression for the workers,soldiers and peasants, continuation of the war, inevitable hungerand death....Or-the power will be transferred to the hands of the revolutionaryworkers, soldiers and peasants; and in that case it will mean acomplete abolition of landlord tyranny, immediate check of thecapitalists, immediate proposal of a just peace. Then the land isassured to the peasants, then control of industry is assured to theworkers, then bread is assured to the hungry, then the end of thisnonsensical war!..._Dien_ contained fragmentary news of the agitated night. Bolshevikicapture of the Telephone Exchange, the Baltic station, the TelegraphAgency; the Peterhof _yunkers_ unable to reach Petrograd; theCossacks undecided; arrest of some of the Ministers; shooting ofChief of the City Militia Meyer;  arrests, counter-arrests,skirmishes between clashing patrols of soldiers, _yunkers_ and RedGuards. (See App. IV, Sect. 1)On the corner of the Morskaya I ran into Captain Gomberg, Menshevik_oboronetz,_ secretary of the Military Section of his party. When Iasked him if the insurrection had really happened he shrugged hisshoulders in a tired manner and replied, "_Tchort znayet!_ The devilknows! Well, perhaps the Bolsheviki can seize the power, but theywon't be able to hold it more than three days. They haven't the mento run a government. Perhaps it's a good thing to let them try-thatwill furnish them...."The Military Hotel at the corner of St. Isaac's Square was picketedby armed sailors. In the lobby were many of the smart youngofficers, walking up and down or muttering together; the sailorswouldn't let them leave....Suddenly came the sharp crack of a rifle outside, followed by ascattered burst of firing. I ran out. Something unusual was going onaround the Marinsky Palace, where the Council of the RussianRepublic met. Diagonally across the wide square was drawn a line ofsoldiers, rifles ready, staring at the hotel roof."_Provacatzia!_ Shot at us!" snapped one, while another went runningtoward the door.At the western corner of the Palace lay a big armoured car with ared flag flying from it, newly lettered in red paint: "S.R.S.D."(_Soviet Rabotchikh Soldatskikh Deputatov_); all the guns trainedtoward St. Isaac's. A barricade had been heaped up across the mouthof Novaya Ulitza-boxes, barrels, an old bed-spring, a wagon. A pileof lumber barred the end of the Moika quay. Short logs from aneighbouring wood-pile were being built up along the front of thebuilding to form breastworks...."Is there going to be any fighting?" I asked."Soon, soon," answered a soldier, nervously. "Go away, comrade,you'll get hurt. They will come from that direction," pointingtoward the Admiralty."Who will?""That I couldn't tell you, brother," he answered, and spat.Before the door of the Palace was a crowd of soldiers and sailors. Asailor was telling of the end of the Council of the RussianRepublic. "We walked in there," he said, "and filled all the doorswith comrades. I went up to the counter-revolutionist Kornilovitzwho sat in the president's chair. 'No more Council,' I says. 'Runalong home now!"'                                                    |There was laughter. By waving assorted papers I managed to getaround to the door of the press gallery. There an enormous smilingsailor stopped me, and when I showed my pass, just said, "If youwere Saint Michael himself, comrade, you couldn't pass here!"Through the glass of the door I made out the distorted face andgesticulating arms of a French correspondent, locked in....Around in front stood a little, grey-moustached man in the uniformof a general, the centre of a knot of soldiers. He was very red inthe face."I am General Alexeyev," he cried. "As your superior officer and asa member of the Council of the Republic I demand to be allowed topass!" The guard scratched his head, looking uneasily out of thecorner of his eye; he beckoned to an approaching officer, who grewvery agitated when he saw who it was and saluted before he realisedwhat he was doing."_Vashe Vuisokoprevoskhoditelstvo_-your High Excellency-" hestammered, in the manner of the old régime, "Access to the Palace isstrictly forbidden--I have no right-"An automobile came by, and I saw Gotz sitting inside, laughingapparently with great amusement. A few minutes later another, witharmed soldiers on the front seat, full of arrested members of theProvisional Government. Peters, Lettish member of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee, came hurrying across the Square."I thought you bagged all those gentlemen last night," said I,pointing to them."Oh," he answered, with the expression of a disappointed small boy."The damn fools let most of them go again before we made up ourminds...."Down the Voskressensky Prospect a great mass of sailors were drawnup, and behind them came marching soldiers, as far as the eye couldreach.We went toward the Winter Palace by way of the Admiralteisky. Allthe entrances to the Palace Square were closed by sentries, and acordon of troops stretched clear across the western end, besieged byan uneasy throng of citizens. Except for far-away soldiers whoseemed to be carrying wood out of the Palace courtyard and piling itin front of the main gateway, everything was quiet.We couldn't make out whether the sentries were pro-Government orpro-Soviet. Our papers from Smolny had no effect, however, so weapproached another part of the line with an important air and showedour American passports, saying "Official business!" and shoulderedthrough. At the door of the Palace the same old _shveitzari,_ intheir brass-buttoned blue uniforms with the red-and-gold collars,politely took our coats and hats, and we went up-stairs. In thedark, gloomy corridor, stripped of its tapestries, a few oldattendants were lounging about, and in front of Kerensky's door ayoung officer paced up and down, gnawing his moustache. We asked ifwe could interview the Minister-president. He bowed and clicked hisheels."No, I am sorry," he replied in French. "Alexander Feodorvitch isextremely occupied just now...." He looked at us for a moment. "Infact, he is not here....""Where is he?""He has gone to the Front. (See App. IV, Sect. 2) And do you know,there wasn't enough gasoline for his automobile. We had to send tothe English Hospital and borrow some.""Are the Ministers here?""They are meeting in some room-I don't know where.'"Are the Bolsheviki coming?""Of course. Certainly, they are coming. I expect a telephone callevery minute to say that they are coming. But we are ready. We have_yunkers_ in the front of the Palace. Through that door there.""Can we go in there?""No. Certainly not. It is not permitted." Abruptly he shook handsall around and walked away. We turned to the forbidden door, set ina temporary partition dividing the hall and locked on the outside.On the other side were voices, and somebody laughing. Except forthat the vast spaces of the old Palace were silent as the grave. Anold _shveitzar_ ran up. "No, _barin,_ you must not go in there.""Why is the door locked?""To keep the soldiers in," he answered. After a few minutes he saidsomething about having a glass of tea and went back up the hall. Weunlocked the door.Just inside a couple of soldiers stood on guard, but they saidnothing. At the end of the corridor was a large, ornate room withgilded cornices and enormous crystal lustres, and beyond it severalsmaller ones, wainscoted with dark wood. On both sides of theparquetted floor lay rows of dirty mattresses and blankets, uponwhich occasional soldiers were stretched out; everywhere was alitter of cigarette-butts, bits of bread, cloth, and empty bottleswith expensive French labels. More and more soldiers, with the redshoulder-straps of the _yunker_-schools, moved about in a staleatmosphere of tobacco-smoke and unwashed humanity. One had a bottleof white Burgundy, evidently filched from the cellars of the Palace.They looked at us with astonishment as we marched past, through roomafter room, until at last we came out into a series of greatstate-salons, fronting their long and dirty windows on the Square.The walls were covered with huge canvases in massive giltframes-historical battle-scenes.... "12 October 1812" and "6 November1812" and "16/28 August 1813." ... One had a gash across the upperright hand corner.The place was all a huge barrack, and evidently had been for weeks,from the look of the floor and walls. Machine guns were mounted onwindow-sills, rifles stacked between the mattresses.As we were looking at the pictures an alcoholic breath assailed mefrom the region of my left ear, and a voice said in thick but fluentFrench, "I see, by the way you admire the paintings, that you areforeigners." He was a short, puffy man with a baldish head as heremoved his cap."Americans? Enchanted. I am Stabs-Capitan Vladimir Artzibashev,absolutely at your service." It did not seem to occur to him thatthere was anything unusual in four strangers, one a woman, wanderingthrough the defences of an army awaiting attack. He began tocomplain of the state of Russia."Not only these Bolsheviki," he said, "but the fine traditions ofthe Russian army are broken down. Look around you. These are allstudents in the officers' training schools. But are they gentlemen?Kerensky opened the officers' schools to the ranks, to any soldierwho could pass an examination. Naturally there are many, many whoare contaminated by the Revolution...."Without consequence he changed the subject. "I am very anxious to goaway from Russia. I have made up my mind to join the American army.Will you please go to your Consul and make arrangements? I will giveyou my address." In spite of our protestations he wrote it on apiece of paper, and seemed to feel better at once. I have itstill-"_Oranien-baumskaya Shkola Praporshtchikov 2nd, StarayaPeterhof._""We had a review this morning early," he went on, as he guided usthrough the rooms and explained everything. "The Women's Battaliondecided to remain loyal to the Government.""Are the women soldiers in the Palace?""Yes, they are in the back rooms, where they won't be hurt if anytrouble comes." He sighed. "It is a great responsibility," said he.For a while we stood at the window, looking down on the Squarebefore the Palace, where three companies of long-coated _yunkers_were drawn up under arms, being harangued by a tall,energetic-looking officer I recognised as Stankievitch, chiefMilitary Commissar of the Provisional Government. After a fewminutes two of the companies shouldered arms with a clash, barkedthree sharp shouts, and went swinging off across the Square,disappearing through the Red Arch into the quiet city."They are going to capture the Telephone Exchange," said some one.Three cadets stood by us, and we fell into conversation. They saidthey had entered the schools from the ranks, and gave theirnames-Robert Olev, Alexei Vasilienko and Erni Sachs, an Esthonian.But now they didn't want to be officers any more, because officerswere very unpopular. They didn't seem to know what to do, as amatter of fact, and it was plain that they were not happy.But soon they began to boast. "If the Bolsheviki come we shall showthem how to fight. They do not dare to fight, they are cowards. Butif we should be overpowered, well, every man keeps one bullet forhimself...."At this point there was a burst of rifle-fire not far off. Out onthe Square all the people began to run, falling flat on their faces,and the _izvoshtchiki,_ standing on the corners, galloped in everydirection. Inside all was uproar, soldiers running here and there,grabbing up guns, rifle-belts and shouting, "Here they come! Herethey come!" ... But in a few minutes it quieted down again. The_izvoshtchiki_ came back, the people lying down stood up. Throughthe Red Arch appeared the _yunkers,_ marching a little out of step,one of them supported by two comrades.It was getting late when we left the Palace. The sentries in theSquare had all disappeared. The great semi-circle of Governmentbuildings seemed deserted. We went into the Hotel France for dinner,and right in the middle of soup the waiter, very pale in the face,came up and insisted that we move to the main dining-room at theback of the house, because they were going to put out the lights inthe café. "There will be much shooting," he said.When we came out on the Morskaya again it was quite dark, except forone flickering street-light on the corner of the Nevsky. Under thisstood a big armored automobile, with racing engine and oil-smokepouring out of it. A small boy had climbed up the side of the thingand was looking down the barrel of a machine gun. Soldiers andsailors stood around, evidently waiting for something. We walkedback up to the Red Arch, where a knot of soldiers was gatheredstaring at the brightly-lighted Winter Palace and talking in loudtones."No, comrades," one was saying. "How can we shoot at them? TheWomen's Battalion is in there-they will say we have fired on Russianwomen."As we reached the Nevsky again another armoured car came around thecorner, and a man poked his head out of the turret-top."Come on!" he yelled. "Let's go on through and attack!"The driver of the other car came over, and shouted so as to be heardabove the roaring engine. "The Committee says to wait. They have gotartillery behind the wood-piles in there...."Here the street-cars had stopped running, few people passed, andthere were no lights; but a few blocks away we could see the trams,the crowds, the lighted shop-windows and the electric signs of themoving-picture shows-life going on as usual. We had tickets to theBallet at the Marinsky Theatre-all theatres were open-but it was tooexciting out of doors....In the darkness we stumbled over lumber-piles barricading the PoliceBridge, and before the Stroganov Palace made out some soldierswheeling into position a three-inch field-gun. Men in variousuniforms were coming and going in an aimless way, and doing a greatdeal of talking....Up the Nevsky the whole city seemed to be out promenading. On everycorner immense crowds were massed around a core of hot discussion.Pickets of a dozen soldiers with fixed bayonets lounged at thestreet-crossings, red-faced old men in rich fur coats shook theirfists at them, smartly-dressed women screamed epithets; the soldiersargued feebly, with embarrassed grins.... Armoured cars went up anddown the street, named after the first Tsars-Oleg, Rurik,Svietoslav-and daubed with huge red letters, "R. S. D. R. P."_(Rossiskaya Partia_) [*]. At the Mikhailovsky a man appeared with an[* (Russian Social Democratic Labor Party).]armful of newspapers, and was immediately stormed by frantic people,offering a rouble, five roubles, ten roubles, tearing at each otherlike animals. It was _Rabotchi i Soldat,_ announcing the victory ofthe Proletarian Revolution, the liberation of the Bolsheviki stillin prison, calling upon the Army front and rear for support... afeverish little sheet of four pages, running to enormous type,containing no news....On the corner of the Sadovaya about two thousand citizens hadgathered, staring up at the roof of a tall building, where a tinyred spark glowed and waned."See!" said a tall peasant, pointing to it. "It is a provocator.Presently he will fire on the people...." Apparently no one thought ofgoing to investigate.The massive facade of Smolny blazed with lights as we drove up, andfrom every street converged upon it streams of hurrying shapes dimin the gloom. Automobiles and motorcycles came and went; an enormouselephant-coloured armoured automobile, with two red flags flyingfrom the turret, lumbered out with screaming siren. It was cold, andat the outer gate the Red Guards had built themselves a bon-fire. Atthe inner gate, too, there was a blaze, by the light of which thesentries slowly spelled out our passes and looked us up and down.The canvas covers had been taken off the four rapid-fire guns oneach side of the doorway, and the ammunition-belts hung snakelikefrom their breeches. A dun herd of armoured cars stood under thetrees in the court-yard, engines going. The long, bare,dimly-illuminated halls roared with the thunder of feet, calling,shouting.... There was an atmosphere of recklessness. A crowd camepouring down the staircase, workers in black blouses and round blackfur hats, many of them with guns slung over their shoulders,soldiers in rough dirt-coloured coats and grey fur _shapki_ pinchedflat, a leader or so-Lunatcharsky, Kameniev-hurrying along in thecentre of a group all talking at once, with harassed anxious faces,and bulging portfolios under their arms. The extraordinary meetingof the Petrograd Soviet was over. I stopped Kameniev-a quick movinglittle man, with a wide, vivacious face set close to his shoulders.Without preface he read in rapid French a copy of the resolutionjust passed:The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, salutingthe victorious Revolution of the Petrograd proletariat and garrison,particularly emphasises the unity, organisation, discipline, andcomplete cooperation shown by the masses in this rising; rarely hasless blood been spilled, and rarely has an insurrection succeeded sowell.The Soviet expresses its firm conviction that the Workers' andPeasants' Government which, as the government of the Soviets, willbe created by the Revolution, and which will assure the industrialproletariat of the support of the entire mass of poor peasants, willmarch firmly toward Socialism, the only means by which the countrycan be spared the miseries and unheard-of horrors of war.The new Workers' and Peasants' Government will propose immediately ajust and democratic peace to all the belligerent countries.It will suppress immediately the great landed property, and transferthe land to the peasants. It will establish workmen's control overproduction and distribution of manufactured products, and will setup a general control over the banks, which it will transform into astate monopoly.The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies calls uponthe workers and the peasants of Russia to support with all theirenergy and all their devotion the Proletarian Revolution. The Sovietexpresses its conviction that the city workers, allies of the poorpeasants, will assure complete revolutionary order, indispensable tothe victory of Socialism. The Soviet is convinced that theproletariat of the countries of Western Europe will aid us inconducting the cause of Socialism to a real and lasting victory."You consider it won then?"He lifted his shoulders. "There is much to do. Horribly much. It isjust beginning....On the landing I met Riazanov, vice-president of the Trade Unions,looking black and biting his grey beard. "It's insane! Insane!" heshouted. "The European working-class won't move! All Russia-" Hewaved his hand distractedly and ran off. Riazanov and Kameniev hadboth opposed the insurrection, and felt the lash of Lenin's terribletongue....It had been a momentous session. In the name of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee Trotzky had declared that the ProvisionalGovernment no longer existed."The characteristic of bourgeois governments," he said, "is todeceive the people. We, the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' andPeasants' Deputies, are going to try an experiment unique inhistory; we are going to found a power which will have no other aimbut to satisfy the needs of the soldiers, workers, and peasants."Lenin had appeared, welcomed with a mighty ovation, prophesyingworld-wide Social Revolution.... And Zinoviev, crying, "This day wehave paid our debt to the international proletariat, and struck aterrible blow at the war, a terrible body-blow at all theimperialists and particularly at Wilhelm the Executioner....Then Trotzky, that telegrams had been sent to the front announcingthe victorious insurrection, but no reply had come. Troops were saidto be marching against Petrograd-a delegation must be sent to tellthem the truth.Cries, "You are anticipating the will of the All-Russian Congress ofSoviets!"Trotzky, coldly, "The will of the All-Russian Congress of Sovietshas been anticipated by the rising of the Petrograd workers andsoldiers!"So we came into the great meeting-hall, pushing through theclamorous mob at the door. In the rows of seats, under the whitechandeliers, packed immovably in the aisles and on the sides,perched on every window-sill, and even the edge of the platform, therepresentatives of the workers and soldiers of all Russia waited inanxious silence or wild exultation the ringing of the chairman'sbell. There was no heat in the hall but the stifling heat ofunwashed human bodies. A foul blue cloud of cigarette smoke rosefrom the mass and hung in the thick air. Occasionally some one inauthority mounted the tribune and asked the comrades not to smoke;then everybody, smokers and all, took up the cry "Don't smoke,comrades!" and went on smoking. Petrovsky, Anarchist delegate fromthe Obukhov factory, made a seat for me beside him. Unshaven andfilthy, he was reeling from three nights' sleepless work on theMilitary Revolutionary Committee.On the platform sat the leaders of the old _Tsay-ee-kah_-for thelast time dominating the turbulent Soviets, which they had ruledfrom the first days, and which were now risen against them. It wasthe end of the first period of the Russian revolution, which thesemen had attempted to guide in careful ways.... The three greatest ofthem were not there: Kerensky, flying to the front through countrytowns all doubtfully heaving up; Tcheidze, the old eagle, who hadcontemptuously retired to his own Georgian mountains, there tosicken with consumption; and the high-souled Tseretelli, alsomortally stricken, who, nevertheless, would return and pour out hisbeautiful eloquence for a lost cause. Gotz sat there, Dan, Lieber,Bogdanov, Broido, Fillipovsky,-white-faced, hollow-eyed andindignant. Below them the second _siezd_ of the All-Russian Sovietsboiled and swirled, and over their heads the Military RevolutionaryCommittee functioned white-hot, holding in its hands the threads ofinsurrection and striking with a long arm.... It was 10.40 P. M.Dan, a mild-faced, baldish figure in a shapeless military surgeon'suniform, was ringing the bell. Silence fell sharply, intense, brokenby the scuffling and disputing of the people at the door...."We have the power in our hands," he began sadly, stopped for amoment, and then went on in a low voice. "Comrades! The Congress ofSoviets in meeting in such unusual circumstances and in such anextraordinary moment that you will understand why the _Tsay-ee-kah_considers it unnecessary to address you with a political speech.This will become much clearer to you if you will recollect that I ama member of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and that at this very moment ourparty comrades are in the Winter Palace under bombardment,sacrificing themselves to execute the duty put on them by the_Tsay-ee-kah."_ (Confused uproar.)"I declare the first session of the Second Congress of Soviets ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies open!"The election of the presidium took place amid stir and moving about.Avanessov announced that by agreement of the Bolsheviki, LeftSocialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki Internationalists, it wasdecided to base the presidium upon proportionality. SeveralMensheviki leaped to their feet protesting. A bearded soldiershouted at them, "Remember what you did to us Bolsheviki when _we_were the minority!" Result-14 Bolsheviki, 7 SocialistRevolutionaries, 3 Mensheviki and 1 Internationalist (Gorky'sgroup). Hendelmann, for the right and centre SocialistRevolutionaries, said that they refused to take part in thepresidium; the same from Kintchuk, for the Mensheviki; and from theMensheviki Internationalists, that until the verification of certaincircumstances, they too could not enter the presidium. Scatteringapplause and hoots. One voice, "Renegades, you call yourselvesSocialists!" A representative of the Ukrainean delegates demanded,and received, a place. Then the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ stepped down, andin their places appeared Trotzky, Kameniev, Lunatcharsky, MadameKollentai, Nogin.... The hall rose, thundering. How far they hadsoared, these Bolsheviki, from a despised and hunted sect less thanfour months ago, to this supreme place, the helm of great Russia infull tide of insurrection!The order of the day, said Kameniev, was first, Organisation ofPower; second, War and Peace; and third, the Constituent Assembly.Lozovsky, rising, announced that upon agreement of the bureau of allfactions, it was proposed to hear and discuss the report of thePetrograd Soviet, then to give the floor to members of the_Tsay-ee-kah_ and the different parties, and finally to pass to theorder of the day.But suddenly a new sound made itself heard, deeper than the tumultof the crowd, persistent, disquieting,-the dull shock of guns.People looked anxiously toward the clouded windows, and a sort offever came over them. Martov, demanding the floor, croaked hoarsely,"The civil war is beginning, comrades! The first question must be apeaceful settlement of the crisis. On principle and from a politicalstandpoint we must urgently discuss a means of averting civil war.Our brothers are being shot down in the streets! At this moment,when before the opening of the Congress of Soviets the question ofPower is being settled by means of a military plot organised by oneof the revolutionary parties-" for a moment he could not makehimself heard above the noise, "All of the revolutionary partiesmust face the fact! The first _vopros_ (question) before theCongress is the question of Power, and this question is alreadybeing settled by force of arms in the streets!... We must create apower which will be recognised by the whole democracy. If theCongress wishes to be the voice of the revolutionary democracy itmust not sit with folded hands before the developing civil war, theresult of which may be a dangerous outburst of counter-revolution....The possibility of a peaceful outcome lies in the formation of aunited democratic authority.... We must elect a delegation tonegotiate with the other Socialist parties and organisation....Always the methodical muffled boom of cannon through the windows,and the delegates, screaming at each other.... So, with the crash ofartillery, in the dark, with hatred, and fear, and reckless daring,new Russia was being born.The Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the United Social Democratssupported Martov's proposition. It was accepted. A soldier announcedthat the All-Russian Peasants' Soviets had refused to send delegatesto the Congress; he proposed that a committee be sent with a formalinvitation. "Some delegates are present," he said. "I move that theybe given votes." Accepted.Kharash, wearing the epaulets of a captain, passionately demandedthe floor. "The political hypocrites who control this Congress," heshouted, "told us we were to settle the question of Power-and it isbeing settled behind our backs, before the Congress opens! Blows arebeing struck against the Winter Palace, and it is by such blows thatthe nails are being driven into the coffin of the political partywhich has risked such an adventure!" Uproar. Followed him Gharra:"While we are here discussing propositions of peace, there is abattle on in the streets.... The Socialist Revolutionaries and theMensheviki refuse to be involved in what is happening, and call uponall public forces to resist the attempt to capture the power...."Kutchin, delegate of the 12th Army and representative of theTroudoviki: "I was sent here only for information, and I amreturning at once to the Front, where all the Army Committeesconsider that the taking of power by the Soviets, only three weeksbefore the Constituent Assembly, is a stab in the back of the Armyand a crime against the people-!" Shouts of "Lie! You lie!"... When hecould be heard again, "Let's make an end of this adventure inPetrograd! I call upon all delegates to leave this hall in order tosave the country and the Revolution!" As he went down the aisle inthe midst of a deafening noise, people surged in upon him,threatening.... Then Khintchuk, an officer with a long brown goatee,speaking suavely and persuasively: "I speak for the delegates fromthe Front. The Army is imperfectly represented in this Congress, andfurthermore, the Army does not consider the Congress of Sovietsnecessary at this time, only three weeks before the opening of theConstituent-" shouts and stamping, always growing more violent. "TheArmy does not consider that the Congress of Soviets has thenecessary authority-" Soldiers began to stand up all over the hall."Who are you speaking for? What do you represent?" they cried."The Central Executive Committee of the Soviet of the Fifth Army,the Second F- regiment, the First N- Regiment, the Third S- Rifles....""When were you elected? You represent the officers, not thesoldiers! What do the soldiers say about it?" Jeers and hoots."We, the Front group, disclaim all responsibility for what hashappened and is happening, and we consider it necessary to mobiliseall self-conscious revolutionary forces for the salvation of theRevolution! The Front group will leave the Congress.... The place tofight is out on the streets!"Immense bawling outcry. "You speak for the Staff-not for the Army!""I appeal to all reasonable soldiers to leave this Congress!""Kornilovitz! Counter-revolutionist! Provocator!" were hurled at him.On behalf of the Mensheviki, Khintchuk then announced that the onlypossibility of a peaceful solution was to begin negotiations withthe Provisional Government for the formation of a new Cabinet, whichwould find support in all strata of society. He could not proceedfor several minutes. Raising his voice to a shout he read theMenshevik declaration:"Because the Bolsheviki have made a military conspiracy with the aidof the Petrograd Soviet, without consulting the other factions andparties, we find it impossible to remain in the Congress, andtherefore withdraw, inviting the other groups to follow us and tomeet for discussion of the situation!""Deserter!" At intervals in the almost continuous disturbanceHendelman, for the Socialist Revolutionaries, could be heardprotesting against the bombardment of the Winter Palace.... "We areopposed to this kind of anarchy...."Scarcely had he stepped down than a young, lean-faced soldier, withflashing eyes, leaped to the platform, and dramatically lifted hishand:"Comrades!" he cried and there was a hush. "My _familia_ (name) isPeterson-I speak for the Second Lettish Rifles. You have heard thestatements of two representatives of the Army committees; thesestatements would have some value _if their authors had beenrepresentatives of the Army_-" Wild applause. _"But they do notrepresent the soldiers!"_ Shaking his fist. "The Twelfth Army hasbeen insisting for a long time upon the re-election of the GreatSoviet and the Army Committee, but just as your own _Tsay-ee-kah,_our Committee refused to call a meeting of the representatives ofthe masses until the end of September, so that the reactionariescould elect their own false delegates to this Congress. I tell younow, the Lettish soldiers have many times said, 'No moreresolutions! No more talk! We want deeds-the Power must be in ourhands!' Let these impostor delegates leave the Congress! The Army isnot with them!"The hall rocked with cheering. In the first moments of the session,stunned by the rapidity of events, startled by the sound of cannon,the delegates had hesitated. For an hour hammer-blow afterhammer-blow had fallen from that tribune, welding them together butbeating them down. Did they stand then alone? Was Russia risingagainst them? Was it true that the Army was marching on Petrograd?Then this clear-eyed young soldier had spoken, and in a flash theyknew it for the truth.... _This_ was the voice of the soldiers-thestirring millions of uniformed workers and peasants were men likethem, and their thoughts and feelings were the same...More soldiers ... Gzhelshakh; for the Front delegates, announcing thatthey had only decided to leave the Congress by a small majority, andthat _the Bolshevik members had not even taken part in the vote,_ asthey stood for division according to political parties, and notgroups. "Hundreds of delegates from the Front," he said, "are beingelected without the participation of the soldiers because the ArmyCommittees are no longer the real representatives of the rank andfile...." Lukianov, crying that officers like Kharash and Khintchukcould not represent the Army in this congress,-but only the highcommand. "The real inhabitants of the trenches want with all theirhearts the transfer of Power into the hands of the Soviets, and theyexpect very much from it!"... The tide was turning.Then came Abramovitch, for the _Bund,_ the organ of the JewishSocial Democrats-his eyes snapping behind thick glasses, tremblingwith rage."What is taking place now in Petrograd is a monstrous calamity! The_Bund_ group joins with the declaration of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries and will leave the Congress!" He raisedhis voice and hand. "Our duty to the Russian proletariat doesn'tpermit us to remain here and be responsible for these crimes.Because the firing on the Winter Palace doesn't cease, the MunicipalDuma together with the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, andthe Executive Committee of the Peasants' Soviet, has decided toperish with the Provisional Government, and we are going with them!Unarmed we will expose our breasts to the machine guns of theTerrorists.... We invite all delegates to this Congress-" The rest waslost in a storm of hoots, menaces and curses which rose to a hellishpitch as fifty delegates got up and pushed their way out....Kameniev jangled the bell, shouting, "Keep your seats and we'll goon with our business!" And Trotzky, standing up with a pale, cruelface, letting out his rich voice in cool contempt, "All theseso-called Socialist compromisers, these frightened Mensheviki,Socialist Revolutionaries, _Bund_-let them go! They are just so muchrefuse which will be swept into the garbage-heap of history!"Riazanov, for the Bolsheviki, stated that at the request of the CityDuma the Military Revolutionary Committee had sent a delegation tooffer negotiations to the Winter Palace. "In this way we have doneeverything possible to avoid blood-shed...."We hurried from the place, stopping for a moment at the room wherethe Military Revolutionary Committee worked at furious speed,engulfing and spitting out panting couriers, despatching Commissarsarmed with power of life and death to all the corners of the city,amid the buzz of the telephonographs. The door opened, a blast ofstale air and cigarette smoke rushed out, we caught a glimpse ofdishevelled men bending over a map under the glare of a shadedelectric-light.... Comrade Josephov-Dukhvinski, a smiling youth with amop of pale yellow hair, made out passes for us.When we came into the chill night, all the front of Smolny was onehuge park of arriving and departing automobiles, above the sound ofwhich could be heard the far-off slow beat of the cannon. A greatmotor-truck stood there, shaking to the roar of its engine. Men weretossing bundles into it, and others receiving them, with guns besidethem."Where are you going?" I shouted."Down-town-all over-everywhere!" answered a little workman,grinning, with a large exultant gesture.We showed our passes. "Come along!" they invited. "But there'llprobably be shooting-" We climbed in; the clutch slid home with araking jar, the great car jerked forward, we all toppled backward ontop of those who were climbing in; past the huge fire by the gate,and then the fire by the outer gate, glowing red on the faces of theworkmen with rifles who squatted around it, and went bumping at topspeed down the Suvorovsky Prospect, swaying from side to side.... Oneman tore the wrapping from a bundle and began to hurl handfuls of     l handfuls of     |          |papers into the air. We imitated him, plunging down through the darkstreet with a tail of white papers floating and eddying out behind.The late passerby stooped to pick them up; the patrols aroundbonfires on the corners ran out with uplifted arms to catch them.Sometimes armed men loomed up ahead, crying "_Shtoi!_" and raisingtheir guns, but our chauffeur only yelled something unintelligibleand we hurtled on....I picked up a copy of the paper, and under a fleeting street-lightread:TO THE CITIZENS OF RUSSIA!The Provisional Government is deposed. The State Power has passedinto the hands of the organ of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' andSoldiers' Deputies, the Military Revolutionary Committee, whichstands at the head of the Petrograd proletariat and garrison.The cause for which the people were fighting: immediate proposal ofa democratic peace, abolition of landlord property-rights over theland, labor control over production, creation of a SovietGovernment-that cause is securely achieved.LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION OF WORKMEN, SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS!_Military Revolutionary Committee__Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies._[Graphic page-96 Proclamation in Russian, title follows]                                              | _   111_ |Proclamation of the Fall of the Provisional Government issued by theMilitary Revolutionary Committee on the night of November 7th (ourcalendar), which we helped to distribute from a motor-truck justafter the surrender of the Winter Palace.A slant-eyed, Mongolian-faced man who sat beside me, dressed in agoat-skin Caucasian cape, snapped, "Look out! Here the provocatorsalways shoot from the windows!" We turned into Znamensky Square,dark and almost deserted, careened around Trubetskoy's brutal statueand swung down the wide Nevsky, three men standing up with riflesready, peering at the windows. Behind us the street was alive withpeople running and stooping. We could no longer hear the cannon, andthe nearer we drew to the Winter Palace end of the city the quieterand more deserted were the streets. The City Duma was all brightlylighted. Beyond that we made out a dark mass of people, and a lineof sailors, who yelled furiously at us to stop. The machine sloweddown, and we climbed out.It was an astonishing scene. Just at the corner of the EkaterinaCanal, under an arc-light, a cordon of armed sailors was drawnacross the Nevsky, blocking the way to a crowd of people in columnof fours. There were about three or four hundred of them, men infrock coats, well-dressed women, officers-all sorts and conditionsof people. Among them we recognised many of the delegates from theCongress, leaders of the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries;Avksentiev, the lean, red-bearded president of the Peasants'Soviets, Sarokin, Kerensky's spokesman, Khintchuk, Abramovitch; andat the head white-bearded old Schreider, Mayor of Petrograd, andProkopovitch, Minister of Supplies in the Provisional Government,arrested that morning and released. I caught sight of Malkin,reporter for the _Russian Daily News._ "Going to die in the WinterPalace," he shouted cheerfully. The procession stood still, but fromthe front of it came loud argument. Schreider and Prokopovitch werebellowing at the big sailor who seemed in command."We demand to pass!" they cried. "See, these comrades come from theCongress of Soviets! Look at their tickets! We are going to theWinter Palace!"The sailor was plainly puzzled. He scratched his head with anenormous hand, frowning. "I have orders from the Committee not tolet anybody go to the Winter Palace," he grumbled. "But I will senda comrade to telephone to Smolny....""We Insist upon passing! We are unarmed! We will march on whetheryou permit us or not!" cried old Schreider, very much excited."I have orders-" repeated the sailor sullenly."Shoot us if you want to! We will pass! Forward!" came from allsides. "We are ready to die, if you have the heart to fire onRussians and comrades! We bare our breasts to your guns!""No," said the sailor, looking stubborn, "I can't allow you to pass.""What will you do if we go forward? Will you shoot?""No, I'm not going to shoot people who haven't any guns. We won'tshoot unarmed Russian people....""We will go forward! What can you do?""We will do something,"replied the sailor, evidently at a loss. "Wecan't let you pass. We will do something.""What will you do? What will you do?"Another sailor came up, very much irritated. "We will spank you!" hecried, energetically. "And if necessary we will shoot you too. Gohome now, and leave us in peace!"At this there was a great clamour of anger and resentment,Prokopovitch had mounted some sort of box, and, waving his umbrella,he made a speech:"Comrades and citizens!" he said. "Force is being used against us!We cannot have our innocent blood upon the hands of these ignorantmen! It is beneath our dignity to be shot down here in the street byswitchmen-" (What he meant by "switchmen" I never discovered.) "Letus return to the Duma and discuss the best means of saving thecountry and the Revolution!"Whereupon, in dignified silence, the procession marched around andback up the Nevsky, always in column of fours. And taking advantageof the diversion we slipped past the guards and set off in thedirection of the Winter Palace.Here it was absolutely dark, and nothing moved but pickets ofsoldiers and Red Guards grimly intent. In front of the KazanCathedral a three-inch field-gun lay in the middle of the street,slewed sideways from the recoil of its last shot over the roofs.Soldiers were standing in every doorway talking in low tones andpeering down toward the Police Bridge. I heard one voice saying: "Itis possible that we have done wrong...." At the corners patrolsstopped all passersby-and the composition of these patrols wasinteresting, for in command of the regular troops was invariably aRed Guard.... The shooting had ceased.Just as we came to the Morskaya somebody was shouting: "The_yunkers_ have sent word they want us to go and get them out!"Voices began to give commands, and in the thick gloom we made out adark mass moving forward, silent but for the shuffle of feet and theclinking of arms. We fell in with the first ranks.Like a black river, filling all the street, without song or cheer wepoured through the Red Arch, where the man just ahead of me said ina low voice: "Look out, comrades! Don't trust them. They will fire,surely!" In the open we began to run, stooping low and bunchingtogether, and jammed up suddenly behind the pedestal of theAlexander Column."How many of you did they kill?" I asked."I don't know. About ten...."After a few minutes huddling there, some hundreds of men, the armyseemed reassured and without any orders suddenly began again to flowforward. By this time, in the light that streamed out of all theWinter Palace windows, I could see that the first two or threehundred men were Red Guards, with only a few scattered soldiers.Over the barricade of firewood we clambered, and leaping down insidegave a triumphant shout as we stumbled on a heap of rifles throwndown by the _yunkers_ who had stood there. On both sides of the maingateway the doors stood wide open, light streamed out, and from thehuge pile came not the slightest sound.Carried along by the eager wave of men we were swept into the righthand entrance, opening into a great bare vaulted room, the cellar ofthe East wing, from which issued a maze of corridors andstair-cases. A number of huge packing cases stood about, and uponthese the Red Guards and soldiers fell furiously, battering themopen with the butts of their rifles, and pulling out carpets,curtains, linen, porcelain plates, glassware.... One man wentstrutting around with a bronze clock perched on his shoulder;another found a plume of ostrich feathers, which he stuck in hishat. The looting was just beginning when somebody cried, "Comrades!Don't touch anything! Don't take anything! This is the property ofthe People!" Immediately twenty voices were crying, "Stop! Puteverything back! Don't take anything! Property of the People!" Manyhands dragged the spoilers down. Damask and tapestry were snatchedfrom the arms of those who had them; two men took away the bronzeclock. Roughly and hastily the things were crammed back in theircases, and self-appointed sentinels stood guard. It was all utterlyspontaneous. Through corridors and up stair-cases the cry could beheard growing fainter and fainter in the distance, "Revolutionarydiscipline! Property of the People...."We crossed back over to the left entrance, in the West wing. Thereorder was also being established. "Clear the Palace!" bawled a RedGuard, sticking his head through an inner door. "Come, comrades,let's show that we're not thieves and bandits. Everybody out of thePalace except the Commissars, until we get sentries posted."Two Red Guards, a soldier and an officer, stood with revolvers intheir hands. Another soldier sat at a table behind them, with penand paper. Shouts of "All out! All out!" were heard far and nearwithin, and the Army began to pour  through the door, jostling,expostulating, arguing. As each man appeared he was seized by theself-appointed committee, who went through his pockets and lookedunder his coat. Everything that was plainly not his property wastaken away, the man at the table noted it on his paper, and it wascarried into a little room. The most amazing assortment of objectswere thus confiscated; statuettes, bottles of ink, bed-spreadsworked with the Imperial monogram, candles, a small oil-painting,desk blotters, gold-handled swords, cakes of soap, clothes of everydescription, blankets. One Red Guard carried three rifles, two ofwhich he had taken away from _yunkers;_ another had four portfoliosbulging with written documents. The culprits either sullenlysurrendered or pleaded like children. All talking at once thecommittee explained that stealing was not worthy of the people'schampions; often those who had been caught turned around and beganto help go through the rest of the comrades. (See App. IV, Sect. 3)_Yunkers_ came out, in bunches of three or four. The committeeseized upon them with an excess of zeal, accompanying the searchwith remarks like, "Ah, Provocators! Kornilovists!Counter-revolutionists! Murderers of the People!" But there was noviolence done, although the _yunkers_ were terrified. They too hadtheir pockets full of small plunder. It was carefully noted down bythe scribe, and piled in the little room.... The _yunkers_ weredisarmed. "Now, will you take up arms against the People any more?"demanded clamouring voices."No," answered the _yunkers,_ one by one. Whereupon they wereallowed to go free.We asked if we might go inside. The committee was doubtful, but thebig Red Guard answered firmly that it was forbidden. "Who are youanyway?" he asked. "How do I know that you are not all Kerenskys?(There were five of us, two women.)"_Pazhal'st', touarishtchi!_ Way, Comrades!" A soldier and a RedGuard appeared in the door, waving the crowd aside, and other guardswith fixed bayonets. After them followed single file half a dozenmen in civilian dress-the members of the Provisional Government.First came Kishkin, his face drawn and pale, then Rutenberg, lookingsullenly at the floor; Terestchenko was next, glancing sharplyaround; he stared at us with cold fixity.... They passed in silence;the victorious insurrectionists crowded to see, but there were onlya few angry mutterings. It was only later that we learned how thepeople in the street wanted to lynch them, and shots were fired-butthe sailors brought them safely to Peter-Paul....In the meanwhile unrebuked we walked into the Palace. There wasstill a great deal of coming and going, of exploring new-foundapartments in the vast edifice, of searching for hidden garrisons of_yunkers_ which did not exist. We went upstairs and wandered throughroom after room. This part of the Palace had been entered also byother detachments from the side of the Neva. The paintings, statues,tapestries and rugs of the great state apartments were unharmed; inthe offices, however, every desk and cabinet had been ransacked, thepapers scattered over the floor, and in the living rooms beds hadbeen stripped of their coverings and ward-robes wrenched open. Themost highly prized loot was clothing, which the working peopleneeded. In a room where furniture was stored we came upon twosoldiers ripping the elaborate Spanish leather upholstery fromchairs. They explained it was to make boots with....The old Palace servants in their blue and red and gold uniformsstood nervously about, from force of habit repeating, "You can't goin there, _barin!_ It is forbidden-" We penetrated at length to thegold and malachite chamber with crimson brocade hangings where theMinisters had been in session all that day and night, and where the_shveitzari_ had betrayed them to the Red Guards. The long tablecovered with green baize was just as they had left it, under arrest.Before each empty seat was pen and ink and paper; the papers werescribbled over with beginnings of plans of action, rough drafts ofproclamations and manifestos. Most of these were scratched out, astheir futility became evident, and the rest of the sheet coveredwith absent-minded geometrical designs, as the writers satdespondently listening while Minister after Minister proposedchimerical schemes. I took one of these scribbled pages, in the handwriting of Konovalov, which read, "The Provisional Governmentappeals to all classes to support the Provisional Government-"All this time, it must be remembered, although the Winter Palace wassurrounded, the Government was in constant communication with theFront and with provincial Russia. The Bolsheviki had captured theMinistry of War early in the morning, but they did not know of themilitary telegraph office in the attic, nor of the private telephoneline connecting it with the Winter Palace. In that attic a youngofficer sat all day, pouring out over the country a flood of appealsand proclamations; and when he heard that the Palace had fallen, puton his hat and walked calmly out of the building....Interested as we were, for a considerable time we didn't notice achange in the attitude of the soldiers and Red Guards around us. Aswe strolled from room to room a small group followed us, until bythe time we reached the great picture-gallery where we had spent theafternoon with the _yunkers,_ about a hundred men surged in afterus. One giant of a soldier stood in our path, his face dark withsullen suspicion.[Graphic page-104  Doodling by Konavalov, title follows]Facsimile of the beginning of a proclamation, written in pencil byA.I. Konovalov, Minister of Commerce and Industry in he ProvisionalGovernment, and then scratched out as the hopelessness of thesituation became more and more evident. The geometrical figurebeneath was probably idly drawn while the Ministers were waiting forthe end."Who are you?" he growled. "What are you doing here?" The othersmassed slowly around, staring and beginning to mutter._"Provocatori!"_ I heard somebody say. "Looters!" I produced ourpasses from the Military Revolutionary Committee. The soldier tookthem gingerly, turned them upside down and looked at them withoutcomprehension. Evidently he could not read. He handed them back andspat on the floor. _"Bumagi!_ Papers!" said he with contempt. Themass slowly began to close in, like wild cattle around a cowpuncheron foot. Over their heads I caught sight of an officer, lookinghelpless, and shouted to him. He made for us, shouldering his waythrough."I'm the Commissar," he said to me. "Who are you? What is it?" Theothers held back, waiting. I produced the papers."You are foreigners?" he rapidly asked in Franch. "It is verydangerous...." Then he turned to the mob, holding up our documents."Comrades!" he cried. "These people are foreign comrades-fromAmerica. They have come here to be able to tell their countrymenabout the bravery and the revolutionary discipline of theproletarian army!""How do you know that?" replied the big soldier. "I tell you theyare provocators! They say they came here to observe therevolutionary discipline of the proletarian army, but they have beenwandering freely through the Palace, and how do we know they haven'tgot their pockets full of loot?"_"Pravilno!"_ snarled the others, pressing forward."Comrades! Comrades!" appealed the officer, sweat standing out onhis forehead. "I am Commissar of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. Do you trust me? Well, I tell you that these passes aresigned with the same names that are signed to my pass!"He led us down through the Palace and out through a door openingonto the Neva quay, before which stood the usual committee goingthrough pockets... "You have narrowly escaped," he kept muttering,wiping his face."What happened to the Women's Battalion?" we asked."Oh-the women!" He laughed. "They were all huddled up in a backroom. We had a terrible time deciding what to do with them-many werein hysterics, and so on. So finally we marched them up to theFinland Station and put them on a train for Levashovo, where theyhave a camp. (See App. IV, Sect. 4)....We came out into the cold, nervous night, murmurous with obscurearmies on the move, electric with patrols. From across the river,where loomed the darker mass of Peter-Paul, came a hoarse shout....Underfoot the sidewalk was littered with broken stucco, from thecornice of the Palace where two shells from the battleship _Avrora_had struck; that was the only damage done by the bombardment....It was now after three in the morning. On the Nevsky all thestreet-lights were again shining, the cannon gone, and the onlysigns of war were Red Guards and soldiers squatting around fires.The city was quiet-probably never so quiet in its history; on thatnight not a single hold-up occurred, not a single robbery.But the City Duma Building was all illuminated. We mounted to thegalleried Alexander Hall, hung with its great, gold-framed,red-shrouded Imperial portraits. About a hundred people were groupedaround the platform, where Skobeliev was speaking. He urged that theCommittee of Public Safety be expanded, so as to unite all theanti-Bolshevik elements in one huge organisation, to be called theCommittee for Salvation of Country and Revolution. And as we lookedon, the Committee for Salvation was formed-that Committee which wasto develop into the most powerful enemy of the Bolsheviki,appearing, in the next week, sometimes under its own partisan name,and sometimes as the strictly non-partisan Committee of PublicSafety....Dan, Gotz, Avkesntiev were there, some of the insurgent Sovietdelegates, members of the Executive Committee of the Peasants'Soviets, old Prokopovitch, and even members of the  Council of theRepublic-among whom Vinaver and other Cadets. Lieber cried that theconvention of Soviets was not a legal convention, that the old_Tsay-ee-kah_ was still in office.... An appeal to the country wasdrafted.We hailed a cab. "Where to?" But when we said "Smolny," the_izvoshtchik_ shook his head. _"Niet!"_ said he, "there aredevils...." It was only after weary wandering that we found a driverwilling to take us-and he wanted thirty rubles, and stopped twoblocks away.The windows of Smolny were still ablaze, motors came and went, andaround the still-leaping fires the sentries huddled close, eagerlyasking everybody the latest news. The corridors were full ofhurrying men, hollow-eyed and dirty. In some of the committee-roomspeople lay sleeping on the floor, their guns beside them. In spiteof the seceding delegates, the hall of meetings was crowded withpeople, roaring like the sea. As we came in, Kameniev was readingthe list of arrested Ministers. The name of Terestchenko was greetedwith thunderous applause, shouts of satisfaction, laughter;Rutenburg came in for less; and at the mention of Paltchinsky, astorm of hoots, angry cries, cheers burst forth.... It was announcedthat Tchudnovsky had been appointed Commissar of the Winter Palace.Now occurred a dramatic interruption. A big peasant, his beardedface convulsed with rage, mounted the platform and pounded with hisfist on the presidium table."We, Socialist Revolutionaries, insist upon the immediate release ofthe Socialist Ministers arrested in the Winter Palace! Comrades! Doyou know that four comrades who risked their lives and their freedomfighting against tyranny of the Tsar, have been flung intoPeter-Paul prison-the historical tomb of Liberty?" In the uproar hepounded and yelled. Another delegate climbed up beside him, andpointed at the presidium."Are the representatives of the revolutionary masses going to sitquietly here while the _Okhrana_ of the Bolsheviki tortures theirleaders?"Trotzky was gesturing for silence. "These 'comrades' who are nowcaught plotting the crushing of the Soviets with the adventurerKerensky-is there any reason to handle them with gloves? After July16th and 18th they didn't use much ceremony with us!" With atriumphant ring in his voice he cried, "Now that the _oborontsi_ andthe faint-hearted have gone, and the whole task of defending andsaving the Revolution rests on our shoulders, it is particularlynecessary to work-work-work! We have decided to die rather than giveup!"Followed him a Commissar from Tsarskoye Selo, panting and coveredwith the mud of his ride. "The garrison of Tsarskoye Selo is onguard at the gates of Petrograd, ready to defend the Soviets and theMilitary Revolutionary Committee!" Wild cheers. "The Cycle Corpssent from the front has arrived at Tsarskoye, and the soldiers arenow with us; they recognise the power of the Soviets, the necessityof immediate transfer of land to the peasants and industrial controlto the workers. The Fifth Battalion of Cyclists, stationed atTsarskoye, is ours....Then the delegate of the Third Cycle Battalion. In the midst ofdelirious enthusiasm he told how the cycle corps had been ordered_three days before_ from the South-west front to the "defence ofPetrograd." They suspected, however, the meaning of the order; andat the station of Peredolsk were met by representatives of the FifthBattalion from Tsarskoye. A joint meeting was held, and it wasdiscovered that "among the cyclists not a single man was foundwilling to shed the blood of his brothers, or to support aGovernment of bourgeois and land-owners!"Kapelinski, for the Mensheviki Internationalists, proposed to electa special committee to find a peaceful solution to the civil war."There isn't any peaceful solution!" bellowed the crowed. "Victoryis the only solution!" The vote was overwhelmingly against, and theMensheviki Internationalists left the Congress in a Whirlwind ofJocular insults. There was no longer any panic fear.... Kameniev fromthe platform shouted after them, "The Mensheviki Internationalistsclaimed 'emergency' for the question of a 'peaceful solution,' butthey always voted for suspension of the order of the day in favourof declarations of factions which wanted to leave the Congress. Itis evident," finished Kameniev, "that the withdrawal of all theserenegades was decided upon beforehand!"The assembly decided to ignore the withdrawal of the factions, andproceed to the appeal to the workers, soldiers and peasants of allRussia:TO WORKERS, SOLDIERS AND PEASANTSThe Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies has opened. It represents the great majority of theSoviets. There are also a number of Peasant deputies. Based upon thewill of the great majority of the workers', soldiers and peasants,based upon the triumphant uprising of the Petrograd workmen andsoldiers, the Congress assumes the Power.The Provisional Government is deposed. Most of the members of theProvisional Government are already arrested.The Soviet authority will at once propose an immediate democraticpeace to all nations, and an immediate truce on all fronts. It willassure the free transfer of landlord, crown and monastery lands tothe Land Committees, defend the soldiers rights, enforcing acomplete democratisation of the Army, establish workers' controlover production, ensure the convocation of the Constituent Assemblyat the proper date, take means to supply bread to the cities andarticles of first necessity to the villages, and secure to allnationalities living in Russia a real right to independent existence.The Congress resolves: that all local power shall be transferred tothe Soviets of Workers,' Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, whichmust enforce revolutionary order.The Congress calls upon the soldiers in the trenches to be watchfuland steadfast. The Congress of Soviets is sure that therevolutionary Army will know how to defend the Revolution againstall attacks of Imperialism, until the new Government shall havebrought about the conclusion of the democratic peace which it willdirectly propose to all nations. The new Government will take allnecessary steps to secure everything needful to the revolutionaryArmy, by means of a determined policy of requisition and taxation ofthe propertied classes, and also to improve the situation ofsoldiers' families.The Kornilovitz-Kerensky, Kaledin and others, are endeavouring tolead troops against Petrograd. Several regiments, deceived byKerensky, have sided with the insurgent People.Soldiers! Make active resistance to the Kornilovitz-Kerensky! Be onguard!Railway men! Stop all troop-trains being sent by Kerensky againstPetrograd!Soldiers, Workers, Clerical employees! The destiny of the Revolutionand democratic peace is in your hands!Long live the Revolution!_The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of__Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.__Delegates from the Peasants' Soviets._It was exactly 5:17 A.M. when Krylenko, staggering with fatigue,climbed to the tribune with a telegram in his hand."Comrades! From the Northern Front. The Twelfth Army sends greetingsto the Congress of Soviets, announcing the formation of a MilitaryRevolutionary Committee which has taken over the command of theNorthern Front!" Pandemonium, men weeping, embracing each other."General Tchermissov has recognised the Committee-Commissar of theProvisional Government Voitinsky has resigned!"So. Lenin and the Petrograd workers had decided on insurrection, thePetrograd Soviet had overthrown the Provisional Government, andthrust the _coup d'etat_ upon the Congress of Soviets. Now there wasall great Russia to win-and then the world! Would Russia follow andrise? And the world-what of it? Would the peoples answer and rise, ared world-tide?Although it was six in the morning, night was yet heavy and chill.There was only a faint unearthly pallor stealing over the silentstreets, dimming the watch-fires, the shadow of a terrible dawngrey-rising over Russia....                              Chapter V                            Plunging AheadTHURSDAY, November 8th. Day broke on a city in the wildestexcitement and confusion, a whole nation having up in long hissingswells of storm. Superficially all was quiet; hundreds of thousandsof people retired at a prudent hour, got up early, and went to work.In Petrograd the street-cars were running, the stores andrestaurants open, theatres going, an exhibition of paintingsadvertised.... All the complex routine of common life-humdrum even inwar-time-proceeded as usual. Nothing is so astounding as thevitality of the social organism-how it persists, feeding itself,clothing itself, amusing itself, in the face of the worstcalamities....The air was full of rumours about Kerensky, who was said to haveraised the Front, and to be leading a great army against thecapital. _Volia Naroda_ published a _prikaz_ launched by him atPskov:The disorders caused by the insane attempt of the Bolsheviki placethe country on the verge of a precipice, and demand the effort ofour entire will, our courage and the devotion of every one of us, towin through the terrible trial which the fatherland is undergoing....Until the declaration of the composition of the new Government-ifone is formed-every one ought to remain at his post and fulfil hisduty toward bleeding Russia. It must be remembered that the leastinterference with existing Army organisations can bring onirreparable misfortunes, by opening the Front to the enemy.Therefore it is indispensable to preserve at any price the morale ofthe troops, by assuring complete order and the preservation of theArmy from new shocks, and by maintaining absolute confidence betweenofficers and their subordinates. I order all the chiefs andCommissars, in the name of the safety of the country, to stay attheir posts, as I myself retain the post of Supreme Commander, untilthe Provisional Government of the Republic shall declare its will....In answer, this placard on all the walls:FROM THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS"The ex-Ministers Konovalov, Kishkin, Terestchenko, Maliantovitch,Nikitin and others have been arrested by the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. Kerensky has fled. All Army organisations are ordered totake every measure for the immediate arrest of Kerensky and hisconveyance to Petrograd."All assistance given to Kerensky will be punished as a seriouscrime against the state."With brakes released the Military Revolutionary Committee whirled,throwing off orders, appeals, decrees, like sparks. (See App. V,Sect. 1)... Kornilov was ordered brought to Petrograd. Members of thePeasant Land Committees imprisoned by the Provisional Governmentwere declared free. Capital punishment in the army was abolished.Government employees were ordered to continue their work, andthreatened with severe penalties if they refused. All pillage,disorder and speculation were forbidden under pain of death.Temporary Commissars were appointed to the various Ministries:Foreign Affairs, Vuritsky and Trotzky; Interior and Justice, Rykov;Labor, Shliapnikov; Finance, Menzhinsky; Public Welfare, MadameKollontai; Commerce, Ways and Communications, Riazanov; Navy, thesailor Korbir; Posts and Telegraphs, Spiro; Theatres, Muraviov;State Printing Office, Gherbychev; for the City of Petrograd,Lieutenant Nesterov; for the Northern Front, Pozern....To the Army, appeal to set up Military Revolutionary Committees. Tothe railway workers, to maintain order, especially not to delay thetransport of food to the cities and the front.... In return, they werepromised representation in the Ministry of Ways and Communications.Cossack brothers! (said one proclamation). You are being led againstPetrograd. They want to force you into battle with the revolutionaryworkers and soldiers of the capital. Do not believe a word that issaid by our common enemies, the land-owners and the capitalists.At our Congress are represented all the conscious organisations ofworkers, soldiers and peasants of Russia. The Congress wishes alsoto welcome into its midst the worker-Cossacks. The Generals of theBlack Band, henchmen of the land-owners, of Nicolai the Cruel, areour enemies.They tell you that the Soviets wish to confiscate the lands of theCossacks. This is a lie. It is only from the great Cossack landlordsthat the Revolution will confiscate the land to give it to thepeople.Organise Soviets of Cossacks' Deputies! Join with the Soviets ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies!Show the Black Band that you are not traitors to the People, andthat you do not wish to be cursed by the whole of revolutionaryRussia!...Cossack brothers, execute no orders of the enemies of the people.Send your delegates to Petrograd to talk it over with us.... TheCossacks of the Petrograd garrison, to their honour, have notjustified the hope of the People's enemies....Cossack brothers! The All-Russian Congress of Soviets extends to youa fraternal hand. Long live the brotherhood of the Cossacks with thesoldiers, workers and peasants of all Russia!On the other side, what a storm of proclamations posted up,hand-bills scattered everywhere, newspapers-screaming and cursingand prophesying evil. Now raged the battle of the printing press-allother weapons being in the hands of the Soviets.First, the appeal of the Committee for Salvation of Country andRevolution, flung broadcast over Russia and Europe:TO THE CITIZENS OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC!Contrary to the will of the revolutionary masses, on November 7ththe Bolsheviki of Petrograd criminally arrested part of theProvisional Government, dispersed the Council of the Republic, andproclaimed an illegal power. Such violence committed against theGovernment of revolutionary Russia at the moment of its greatestexternal danger, is an indescribable crime against the fatherland.The insurrection of the Bolsheviki deals a mortal blow to the causeof national defence, and postpones immeasurably the moment of peaceso greatly desired.Civil war, begun by the Bolsheviki, threatens to deliver the countryto the horrors of anarchy and counter-revolution, and cause thefailure of the Constituent Assembly, which must affirm therepublican régime and transmit to the People forever their right tothe land.Preserving the continuity of the only legal Governmental power, theCommittee for Salvation of Country and Revolution, established onthe night of November 7th, takes the initiative in forming a newProvisional Government; which, basing itself on the forces ofdemocracy, will conduct the country to the Constituent Assembly andsave it from anarchy and counter-revolution. The Committee forSalvation summons you, citizens, to refuse to recognise the power ofviolence. Do not obey its orders!Rise for the defence of the country and Revolution!Support the Committee for Salvation!Signed by the Council of the Russian Republic, the Municipal Duma ofPetrograd, the _Tsay-ee-kah (First Congress),_ the ExecutiveCommittee of the Peasants' Soviets, and from the Congress itself theFront group, the factions of Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviki,Populist Socialists, Unified Social Democrats, and the group"Yedinstvo."Then posters from the Socialist Revolutionary party, the Mensheviki_oborontsi,_ Peasants' Soviets again; from the Central ArmyCommittee, the _Tsentroflot_....... Famine will crush Petrograd! (they cried). The German armies willtrample on our liberty. Black Hundred _pogroms_ will spread overRussia, if we all-conscious workers, soldiers, citizens-do notunite....Do not trust the promises of the Bolsheviki! The promise ofimmediate peace-is a lie! The promise of bread-a hoax! The promiseof land-a fairy tale!...They were all in this manner.Comrades! You have been basely and cruelly deceived! The seizure ofpower has been accomplished by the Bolsheviki alone.... They concealedtheir plot from the other Socialist parties composing the Soviet....You have been promised land and freedom, but the counter-revolutionwill profit by the anarchy called forth by the Bolsheviki, and willdeprive you of land and freedom....The newspapers were as violent.Our duty (said the _Dielo Naroda_) is to unmask these traitors tothe working-class. Our duty is to mobilise all our forces and mountguard over the cause of the Revolution!..._Izviestia,_ for the last time speaking in the name of the old_Tsay-ee-kah,_ threatened awful retribution.As for the Congress of Soviets, we affirm that there has been noCongress of Soviets! We affirm that it was merely a privateconference of the Bolshevik faction! And in that case, they have noright to cancel the powers of the _Tsay-ee-kah_...._Novaya Zhizn,_ while pleading for a new Government that shouldunite all the Socialist parties, criticised severely the action ofthe Socialist Revolutionaries and the Mensheviki in quitting theCongress, and pointed out that the Bolshevik insurrection meant onething very clearly: that all illusions about coalition with thebourgeoisie were henceforth demonstrated vain..._Rabotchi Put_ blossomed out as _Pravda,_ Lenin's newspaper whichhad been suppressed in July. It crowed, bristling:Workers, soldiers, peasants! In March you struck down the tyranny ofthe clique of nobles. Yesterday you struck down the tyranny of thebourgeois gang....The first task now is to guard the approaches to Petrograd.The second is definitely to disarm the counter-revolutionaryelements of Petrograd.The third is definitely to organise the revolutionary power andassure the realisation of the popular programme...What few Cadet organs appeared, and the bourgeoisie generally,adopted a detached, ironical attitude toward the whole business, asort of contemptuous "I-told-you-so" to the other parties.Influential Cadets were to be seen hovering around the MunicipalDuma, and on the outskirts of the Committee for Salvation. Otherthan that, the bourgeoisie lay low, biding its hour-which could notfar off. That the Bolsheviki would remain in power longer than threedays never occurred to anybody-except perhaps to Lenin, Trotzky, thePetrograd workers and the simpler soldiers....In the high, amphitheatrical Nicolai Hall that afternoon I saw theDuma sitting in _permanence,_ tempestuous, grouping around it allthe forces of opposition. The old Mayer, Schreider, majestic withhis white hair and beard, was describing his visit to Smolny thenight before, to protest in the name of the MunicipalSelf-Government. "The Duma, being the only existing legal Governmentin the city, elected by equal, direct and secret suffrage, would notrecognise the new power," he had told Trotzky. And Trotzky hadanswered, "There is a constitutional remedy for that. The Duma canbe dissolved and re-elected...." At this report there was a furiousoutcry."If one recognises a Government by bayonet," continued the old man,addressing the Duma, "well, we have one; but I consider legitimateonly a Government recognised by the majority, and not one created bythe usurpation of a minority!" Wild applause on all benches exceptthose of the Bolsheviki. Amid renewed tumult the Mayor announcedthat the Bolsheviki already were violating Municipal autonomy byappointing Commissars in many departments.The Bolshevik speaker shouted, trying to make himself heard, thatthe decision of the Congress of Soviets meant that all Russia backedup the action of the Bolsheviki."You!" he cried. "You are not the real representative of the peopleof Petrograd!" Shrieks of "Insult! Insult!" The old Mayor, withdignity, reminded him that the Duma was elected by the freestpossible popular vote. "Yes," he answered, "but that was a long timeago-like the _Tsay-ee-kah_-like the Army Committee.""There has been no new Congress of Soviets!" they yelled at him."The Bolshevik faction refuses to remain any longer in this nest ofcounter-revolution-" Uproar. "-and we demand a re-election of theDuma...." Whereupon the Bolsheviki left the chamber, followed by criesof "German agents! Down with the traitors!"Shingariov, Cadet, then demanded that all Municipal functionarieswho had consented to be Commissars of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee be discharged from their position and indicted. Schreiderwas on his feet, putting a motion to the effect that the Dumaprotested against the menace of the Bolsheviki to dissolve it, andas the legal representative of the population, it would refuse toleave its post.Outside, the Alexander Hall was crowded for the meeting of theCommittee for Salvation, and Skobeliev was again speaking. "Neveryet," he said, "was the fate of the Revolution so acute, never yetdid the question of the existence of the Russian state excite somuch anxiety, never yet did history put so harshly and categoricallythe question-is Russia to be or not to be! The great hour for thesalvation of the Revolution has arrived, and in consciousnessthereof we observe the close union of the live forces of therevolutionary democracy, by whose organised will a centre for thesalvation of the country and the Revolution has already beencreated...." And much of the same sort. "We shall die sooner thansurrender our post!"Amid violent applause it was announced that the Union of RailwayWorkers had joined the Committee for Salvation. A few moments laterthe Post and Telegraph Employees came in; then some MenshevikiInternationalists entered the hall, to cheers. The Railway men saidthey did not recognise the Bolsheviki and had taken the entirerailroad apparatus into their own hands, refusing to entrust it toany usurpatory power. The Telegraphers' delegate declared that theoperators had flatly refused to work their instruments as long asthe Bolshevik Commissar was in the office. The Postmen would notdeliver or accept mail at Smolny.... All the Smolny telephones werecut off. With great glee it was reported how Uritzky had gone to theMinistry of Foreign Affairs to demand the secret treaties, and howNeratov had put him out. The Government employees were all stoppingwork....It was war-war deliberately planned, Russian fashion; war by strikeand sabotage. As we sat there the chairman read a list of names andassignments; so-and-so was to make the round of the Ministries;another was to visit the banks; some ten or twelve were to work thebarracks and persuade the soldiers to remain neutral-"Russiansoldiers, do not shed the blood of your brothers!"; a committee wasto go and confer with Kerensky; still others were despatched toprovincial cities, to form branches of the Committee for Salvation,and link together the anti-Bolshevik elements.The crowd was in high spirits. "These Bolsheviki _will_ try todictate to the _intelligentzia?_ We'll show them!"... Nothing could bemore striking than the contrast between this assemblage and theCongress of Soviets. There, great masses of shabby soldiers, grimyworkmen, peasants-poor men, bent and scarred in the brute strugglefor existence; here the Menshevik and Social Revolutionaryleaders-Avksentievs, Dans, Liebers,-the former SocialistMinisters-Skobelievs, Tchernovs,-rubbed shoulders with Cadets likeoily Shatsky, sleek Vinaver; with journalists, students,intellectuals of almost all camps. This Duma crowd was well-fed,well-dressed; I did not see more than three proletarians among themall....News came. Kornilov's faithful _Tekhintsi_  [*] had slaughtered his[* See Notes and Explanations]guards at Bykhov, and he had escaped. Kaledin was marching north....The Soviet of Moscow had set up a Military Revolutionary Committee,and was negotiating with the commandant of the city for possessionof the arsenal, so that the workers might be armed.With these facts was mixed an astounding jumble of rumours,distortions, and plain lies. For instance, an intelligent youngCadet, formerly private secretary to Miliukov and then toTerestchenko, drew us aside and told us all about the taking of theWinter Palace."The Bolsheviki were led by German and Austrian officers," heaffirmed."Is that so?" we replied, politely. "How do you know?""A friend of mine was there and saw them.""How could he tell they were German officers?""Oh, because they wore German uniforms!"There were hundreds of such absurd tales, and they were not onlysolemnly published by the anti-Bolshevik press, but believed by themost unlikely persons-Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki whohad always been distinguished by their sober devotion to facts....But more serious were the stories of Bolshevik violence andterrorism. For example, it was said printed that the Red Guards hadnot only thoroughly looted the Winter Palace, but that they hadmassacred the _yunkers_ after disarming them, had killed some of theMinisters in cold blood; and as for the woman soldiers, most of themhad been violated, and many had committed suicide because of thetortures they had gone through.... All these stories were swallowedwhole by the crowd in the Duma. And worse still, the mothers andfathers of the students and of the women read these frightfuldetails, _often accompanied by lists of names,_ and toward nightfallthe Duma began to be besieged by frantic citizens....A typical case is that of Prince Tumanov, whose body, it wasannounced in many newspapers, had been found floating in the MoikaCanal. A few hours later this was denied by the Prince's family, whoadded that the Prince was under arrest so the press identified thedead man as General Demissov. The General having also come to life,we investigated, and could find no trace of any body found whatever....As we left the Duma building two boy scouts were distributinghand-bills (See App. V, Sect. 2) to the enormous crowd which blockedthe Nevsky in front of the door-a crowd composed almost entirely ofbusiness men, shop-keepers, _tchinouniki,_ clerks. One read!FROM THE MUNICIPAL DUMAThe Municipal Duma in its meeting of October 26th, in view of theevents of the day decrees: To announce the inviolability of privatedwellings. Through the House Committees it calls upon the populationof the town of Petrograd to meet with decisive repulse all attemptsto enter by force private apartments, not stopping at the use ofarms, in the interests of the self-defence of citizens.Up on the corner of the Liteiny, five or six Red Guards and a coupleof sailors had surrounded a news-dealer and were demanding that hehand over his copies of the Menshevik _Rabot-chaya Gazeta_ (Workers'Gazette). Angrily he shouted at them, shaking his fist, as one ofthe sailors tore the papers from his stand. An ugly crowd hadgathered around, abusing the patrol. One little workman keptexplaining doggedly to the people and the news-dealer, over and overagain, "It has Kerensky's proclamation in it. It says we killedRussian people. It will make bloodshed...."Smolny was tenser than ever, if that were possible. The same runningmen in the dark corridors, squads of workers with rifles, leaderswith bulging portfolios arguing, explaining, giving orders as theyhurried anxiously along, surrounded by friends and lieutenants. Menliterally out of themselves, living prodigies of sleeplessness andwork-men unshaven, filthy, with burning eyes, who drove upon theirfixed purpose full speed on engines of exaltation. So much they hadto do, so much! Take over the Government, organise the City, keepthe garrison loyal, fight the Duma and the Committee for Salvation,keep out the Germans, prepare to do battle with Kerensky, inform theprovinces what had happened, Propagandise from Archangel toVladivostok.... Government and Municipal employees refusing to obeytheir Commissars, post and telegraph refusing them communication,railroads roads stonily ignoring their appeals for trains, Kerenskycoming, the garrison not altogether to be trusted, the Cossackswaiting to come out.... Against them not only the organisedbourgeoisie, but all the other Socialist parties except the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries, a few Mensheviki Internationalists andthe Social Democrat Internationalists, and even they undecidedwhether to stand by or not. With them, it is true, the workers andthe soldier-masses-the peasants an unknown quantity-but after allthe Bolsheviki were a political faction not rich in trained andeducated men....Riazanov was coming up the front steps, explaining in a sort ofhumorous panic that he, Commissar of Commerce, knew nothing whateverof business. In the upstairs cafe sat a man all by himself in thecorner, in a goat-skin cape and clothes which had been-I was goingto say "slept in," but of course he hadn't slept-and a three days'growth of beard. He was anxiously figuring on a dirty envelope, andbiting his pencil meanwhile. This was Menzhinsky, Commissar ofFinance, whose qualifications were that he had once been clerk in aFrench bank.... And these four half-running down the hall from theoffice of the Military Revolutionary Committee, and scribbling onbits of paper as they run-these were Commissars despatched to thefour corners of Russia to carry the news, argue, or fight-withwhatever arguments or weapons came to hand....The Congress was to meet at one o'clock, and long since the greatmeeting-hall had filled, but by seven there was yet no sign of thepresidium.... The Bolshevik and Left Social Revolutionary factionswere in session in their own rooms. All the livelong afternoon Leninand Trotzky had fought against compromise. A considerable part ofthe Bolsheviki were in favour of giving way so far as to create ajoint all-Socialist government. "We can't hold on!" they cried."Too much is against us. We haven't got the men. We will beisolated, and the whole thing will fall." So Kameniev, Riazanov andothers.But Lenin, with Trotzky beside him, stood firm as a rock. "Let thecompromisers accept our programme and they can come in! We won'tgive way an inch. If there are comrades here who haven't the courageand the will to dare what we dare, let them leave with the rest ofthe cowards and conciliators! Backed by the workers and soldiers weshall go on."At five minutes past seven came word from the left SocialistRevolutionaries to say that they would remain in the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee."See!" said Lenin. "They are following!"A little later, as we sat at the press table in the big hall, anAnarchist who was writing for the bourgeois papers proposed to methat we go and find out what had become of the presidium. There wasnobody in the _Tsay-ee-kah_ office, nor in the bureau of thePetrograd Soviet. From room to room we wandered, through vastSmolny. Nobody seemed to have the slightest idea where to find thegoverning body of the Congress. As we went my companion describedhis ancient revolutionary activities, his long and pleasant exile inFrance.... As for the Bolsheviki, he confided to me that they werecommon, rude, ignorant persons, without aesthetic sensibilities. Hewas a real specimen of the Russian _intelligentzia_.... So he came atlast to Room 17, office of the Military Revolutionary Committee, andstood there in the midst of all the furious coming and going. Thedoor opened, and out shot a squat, flat-faced man in a uniformwithout insignia, who seemed to be smiling-which smile, after aminute, one saw to be the fixed grin of extreme fatigue. It wasKrylenko.My friend, who was a dapper, civilized-looking young man, gave a cryof pleasure and stepped forward."Nicolai Vasilievitch!" he said, holding out his hand. "Don't youremember me, comrade? We were in prison together."Krylenko made an effort and concentrated his mind and sight. "Whyyes," he answered finally, looking the other up and down with anexpression of great friendliness. "You are S-. _Zdra'stvuitye!_"They kissed. "What are you doing in all this?" He waved his armaround."Oh, I'am just looking on.... You seem very successful.""Yes," replied Krylenko, with a sort of doggedness, "The proletarianRevolution is a great success." He laughed. "Perhaps-perhaps,however, we'll meet in prison again!"When we got out into the corridor again my friend went on with hisexplanations. "You see, I'am a follower of Kropotkin. To us theRevolution is a great failure; it has not aroused the patriotism ofthe masses. Of course that only proves that the people are not readyfor Revolution...."It was just 8.40 when a thundering wave of cheers announced theentrance of the presidium, with Lenin-great Lenin-among them. Ashort, stocky figure, with a big head set down in his shoulders,bald and bulging. Little eyes, a snubbish nose, wide, generousmouth, and heavy chin; clean-shaven now, but already beginning tobristle with the well-known beard of his past and future. Dressed inshabby clothes, his trousers much too long for him. Unimpressive, tobe the idol of a mob, loved and revered as perhaps few leaders inhistory have been. A strange popular leader-a leader purely byvirtue of intellect; colourless, humourless, uncompromising anddetached, without picturesque idiosyncrasies-but with the power ofexplaining profound ideas in simple terms, of analysing a concretesituation. And combined with shrewdness, the greatest intellectualaudacity.Kameniev was reading the report of the actions of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee; abolition of capital punishment in theArmy, restoration of the free right of propaganda, release ofofficers and soldiers arrested for political crimes, orders toarrest Kerensky and confiscation of food supplies in privatestore-houses.... Tremendous applause.Again the representative of the _Bund._ The uncompromising attitudeof the Bolsheviki would mean the crushing of the Revolution;therefore, the _Bund_ delegates must refuse any longer to sit in theCongress. Cries from the audience, "We thought you walked out lastnight! How many times are you going to walk out?"Then the representative of the Mensheviki Internationalists. Shouts,"What! You here still?" The speaker explained that only part of theMensheviki Internationalists left the Congress; the rest were goingto stay-"We consider it dangerous and perhaps even mortal for the Revolutionto transfer the power to the Soviets"-Interruptions-"but we feel itour duty to remain in the Congress and vote against the transferhere!"Other speakers followed, apparently without any order. A delegate ofthe coal-miners of the Don Basin called upon the Congress to takemeasures against Kaledin, who might cut off coal and food from thecapital. Several soldiers just arrived from the Front brought theenthusiastic greetings of their regiments.... Now Lenin, gripping theedge of the reading stand, letting his little winking eyes travelover the crowd as he stood there waiting, apparently oblivious tothe long-rolling ovation, which lasted several minutes. When itfinished, he said simply, "We shall now proceed to construct theSocialist order!" Again that overwhelming human roar."The first thing is the adoption of practical measures to realisepeace.... We shall offer peace to the peoples of all the belligerentcountries upon the basis of the Soviet terms-no annexations, noindemnities, and the right of self-determination of peoples. At thesame time, according to our promise, we shall publish and repudiatethe secret treaties.... The question of War and Peace is so clear thatI think that I may, without preamble, read the project of aProclamation to the Peoples of All the Belligerent Countries...."His great mouth, seeming to smile, opened wide as he spoke; hisvoice was hoarse-not unpleasantly so, but as if it had hardened thatway after years and years of speaking-and went on monotonously, withthe effect of being able to go on forever.... For emphasis he bentforward slightly. No gestures. And before him, a thousand simplefaces looking up in intent adoration.PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS OF ALL THE BELLIGERENTNATIONS.The Workers' and Peasants' Government, created by the revolution ofNovember 6th and 7th and based on the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers'and Peasants' Deputies, proposes to all the belligerent peoples andto their Governments to begin immediately negotiations for a justand democratic peace.The Government means by a just and democratic peace, which isdesired by the immense majority of the workers and the labouringclasses, exhausted and depleted by the war-that peace which theRussian workers and peasants, after having struck down the Tsaristmonarchy, have not ceased to demand categorically-immediate peacewithout annexations (that is to say, without conquest of foreignterritory, without forcible annexation of other nationalities), andwithout indemnities.The Government of Russia Proposes to all the belligerent peoplesimmediately to conclude such a peace, by showing themselves willingto enter upon the decisive steps of negotiations aiming at such apeace, at once, without the slightest delay, before the definitiveratification of all the conditions of such a peace by the authorisedassemblies of the people of all countries and of all nationalities.By annexation or conquest of foreign territory, the Governmentmeans-conformably to the conception of democratic rights in general,and the rights of the working-class in particular-all union to agreat and strong State of a small or weak nationality, without thevoluntary, clear and precise expression of its consent and desire;whatever be the moment when such an annexation by force wasaccomplished, whatever be the degree civilisation of the nationannexed by force or maintained outside the frontiers of anotherState, no matter if that nation be in Europe or in the far countriesacross the sea.If any nation is retained by force within the limits of anotherState; if, in spite of the desire expressed by it, (it matterslittle if that desire be expressed by the press, by popularmeetings, decisions of political parties, or by disorders and riotsagainst national oppression), that nation is not given the right ofdeciding by free vote-without the slightest constraint, after thecomplete departure of the armed forces of the nation which hasannexed it or wishes to annex it or is stronger in general-the formof its national and political organisation, such a union constitutesan annexation-that is to say, conquest and an act of violence.To continue this war in order to permit the strong and rich nationsto divide among themselves the weak and conquered nationalities isconsidered by the Government the greatest possible crime againsthumanity; and the Government solemnly proclaims its decision to signa treaty of peace which will put an end to this war upon the aboveconditions, equally fair for all nationalities without exception.The Government abolishes secret diplomacy, expressing before thewhole country its firm decision to conduct all the negotiations inthe light of day before the people, and will proceed immediately tothe full publication of all secret treaties confirmed or concludedby the Government of land-owners and capitalists, from March untilNovember 7th, 1917. All the clauses of the secret treaties which, asoccur in a majority of cases, have for their object to procureadvantages and privileges for Russian capitalists, to maintain oraugment the annexations of the Russian imperialists, are denouncedby the Government immediately and without discussion.In proposing to all Governments and all peoples to engage in publicnegotiations for peace, the Government declares itself ready tocarry on these negotiations by telegraph, by post, or by pourparlersbetween the representatives of the different countries, or at aconference of these representatives. To facilitate thesepourparlers, the Government appoints its authorised representativesin the neutral countries.The Government proposes to all the governments and to the peoples ofall the belligerent countries to conclude an immediate armistice, atthe same time suggesting that the armistice ought to last threemonths, during which time it is perfectly possible, not only to holdthe necessary pourparlers between the representatives of all thenations and nationalities without exception drawn into the war orforced to take part in it, but also to convoke authorised assembliesof representatives of the people of all countries, for the purposeof the definite acceptance of the conditions of peace.In addressing this offer of peace to the Governments and to thepeoples of all the belligerent countries, the Provisional Workers'and Peasants' Government of Russia addresses equally and inparticular the conscious workers of the three nations most devotedto humanity and the three most important nations among those takingpart in the present war-England, France, and Germany. The workers ofthese countries have rendered the greatest services to the cause ofprogress and of Socialism. The splendid examples of the Chartistmovement in England, the series of revolutions, of world-widehistorical significance, accomplished by the French proletariat-andfinally, in Germany, the historic struggle against the Laws ofException, an example for the workers of the whole world ofprolonged and stubborn action, and the creation of the formidableorganisations of German proletarians-all these models of proletarianheroism, these monuments of history, are for us a sure guaranteethat the workers of these countries will understand the duty imposedupon them to liberate humanity from the horrors and consequences ofwar; and that these workers, by decisive, energetic and continuedaction, will help us to bring to a successful conclusion the causeof peace-and at the same time, the cause of the liberation of theexploited working masses from all slavery and all exploitation.When the grave thunder of applause had died away, Lenin spoke again:"We propose to the Congress to ratify this declaration. We addressourselves to the Governments as well as to the peoples, for adeclaration which would be addressed only to the peoples of thebelligerent countries might delay the conclusion of peace. Theconditions of peace, drawn up during the armistice, will be ratifiedby the Constituent Assembly. In fixing the duration of the armisticeat three months, we desire to give to the peoples as long a rest aspossible after this bloody extermination, and ample time for them toelect their representatives. This proposal of peace will meet withresistance on the part of the imperialist governments-we don't foolourselves on that score. But we hope that revolution will soon breakout in all the belligerent countries; that is why we addressourselves especially to the workers of France, England and Germany...."The revolution of November 6th and 7th," he ended, "has opened theera of the Social Revolution.... The labour movement, in the name ofpeace and Socialism, shall win, and fulfil its destiny....There was something quiet and powerful in all this, which stirredthe souls of men. It was understandable why people believed whenLenin spoke...."By crowd vote it was quickly decided that only representatives ofpolitical factions should be allowed to speak on the motion and thatspeakers should be limited to fifteen minutes.First Karelin for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. "Our factionhad no opportunity to propose amendments to the text of theproclamation; it is a private document of the Bolsheviki. But wewill vote for it because we agree with its spirit...."For the Social Democrats Internationalists Kramarov, long,stoop-shouldered and near-sighted-destined to achieve some notorietyas the Clown of the Opposition. Only a Government composed of allthe Socialist parties, he said, could possess the authority to takesuch important action. If a Socialist coalition were formed, hisfaction would support the entire programme; if not, only part of it.As for the proclamation, the Internationalists were in thoroughaccord with its main points....Then one after another, amid rising enthusiasm; Ukrainean SocialDemocracy, support; Lithuanian Social Democracy, support; PopulistSocialists, support; Polish Social Democracy, support; PolishSocialists support-but would prefer a Socialist coalition; LettishSocial Democracy, support.... Something was kindled in these men. Onespoke of the "coming World-Revolution, of which we are theadvance-guard"; another of "the new age of brotherhood, when all thepeoples will become one great family...." An individual member claimedthe floor. "There is contradiction here," he said. "First you offerpeace without annexations and indemnities, and then you say you willconsider all peace offers. To consider means to accept...."Lenin was on his feet. "We want a just peace, but we are not afraidof a revolutionary war.... Probably the imperialist Governments willnot answer our appeal-but we shall not issue an ultimatum to whichit will be easy to say no.... If the German proletariat realises thatwe are ready to consider all offers of peace, that will perhaps bethe last drop which overflows the bowl-revolution will break out inGermany...."We consent to examine all conditions of peace, but that doesn'tmean that we shall accept them.... For some of our terms we shallfight to the end-but possibly for others will find it impossible tocontinue the war.... Above all, we want to finish the war...."It was exactly 10:35 when Kameniev asked all in favour of theproclamation to hold up their cards. One delegate dared to raise hishand against, but the sudden sharp outburst around him brought itswiftly down.... Unanimous.Suddenly, by common impulse, we found ourselves on our feet,mumbling together into the smooth lifting unison of the_Internationale._ A grizzled old soldier was sobbing like a child.Alexandra Kollontai rapidly winked the tears back. The immense soundrolled through the hall, burst windows and doors and seared into thequiet sky. "The war is ended! The war is ended!" said a youngworkman near me, his face shining. And when it was over, as we stoodthere in a kind of awkward hush, some one in the back of the room     ck of the room     |          |shouted, "Comrades! Let us remember those who have died forliberty!" So we began to sing the Funeral March, that slow,melancholy and yet triumphant chant, so Russian and so moving. The_Internationale_ is an alien air, after all. The Funeral Marchseemed the very soul of those dark masses whose delegates sat inthis hall, building from their obscure visions a new Russia-andperhaps more.You fell in the fatal fightFor the liberty of the people, for the honour of the people....You gave up your lives and everything dear to you,You suffered in horrible prisons,You went to exile in chains....Without a word you carried your chains because you could not ignoreyour suffering brothers,Because you believed that justice is stronger than the sword....The time will come when your surrendered life will countThat time is near; when tyranny falls the people will rise, greatand free!Farewell, brothers, you chose a noble path,You are followed by the new and fresh army ready to die and tosuffer....Farewell, brothers, you chose a noble path,At your grave we swear to fight, to work for freedom and thepeople's happiness....For this did they lie there, the martyrs of March, in their coldBrotherhood Grave on Mars Field; for this thousands and tens ofthousands had died in the prisons, in exile, in Siberian mines. Ithad not come as they expected it would come, nor as the_intelligentzia_ desired it; but it had come-rough, strong,impatient of formulas, contemptuous of sentimentalism; real....Lenin was reading the Decree on Land:(1.) All private ownership of land is abolished immediately withoutcompensation.(2.) All land_owners' estates, and all lands belonging to the Crown,to monasteries, church lands with all their live stock andinventoried property, buildings and all appurtenances, aretransferred to the disposition of the township Land Committees andthe district Soviets of Peasants' Deputies until the ConstituentAssembly meets.(3.) Any damage whatever done to the confiscated property which fromnow on belongs to the whole People, is regarded as a serious crime,punishable by the revolutionary tribunals. The district Soviets ofPeasants' Deputies shall take all necessary measures for theobservance of the strictest order during the taking over of theland-owners' estates, for the determination of the dimensions of theplots of land and which of them are subject to confiscation, for thedrawing up of an inventory of the entire confiscated property, andfor the strictest revolutionary protection of all the farmingproperty on the land, with all buildings, implements, cattle,supplies of products, etc., passing into the hands of the People.(4.) For guidance during the realisation of the great land reformsuntil their final resolution by the Constituent Assembly, shallserve the following peasant _nakaz_ (See App. V, Sect. 3)(instructions), drawn up on the basis of 242 local peasant _nakazi_by the editorial board of the "_Izviestia_ of the All-Russian Sovietof Peasants' Deputies," and published in No.88 of said _"Izviestia"_(Petrograd, No.88, August 19th, 1917).The lands of peasants and of Cossacks serving in the Army shall notbe confiscated."This is not," explained Lenin, "the project of former MinisterTchernov, who spoke of 'erecting a frame-work' and tried to realisereforms from above. From below, on the spot, will be decided thequestions of division of the land. The amount of land received byeach peasant will vary according to the locality...."Under the Provisional Government, the _pomieshtchiki_ flatlyrefused to obey the orders of the Land Committees-those LandCommittees projected by Lvov, brought into existence by Shingariov,and administered by Kerensky!"Before the debates could begin a man forced his way violentlythrough the crowd in the aisle and climbed upon the platform. It wasPianikh, member of the Executive Committee of the Peasants' Soviets,and he was mad clean through."The Executive Committee of the All-Russian Soviets of Peasants'Deputies protests against the arrest of our comrades, the MinistersSalazkin and Mazlov!" he flung harshly in the faces of the crowd,"We demand their instant release! They are now in Peter-Paulfortress. We must have immediate action! There is not a moment tolose!"Another followed him, a soldier with disordered beard and flamingeyes. "You sit here and talk about giving the land to the peasants,and you commit an act of tyrants and usurpers against the peasants'chosen representatives! I tell you-" he raised his fist, "If onehair of their heads is harmed, you'll have a revolt on your hands!"The crowd stirred confusedly.Then up rose Trotzky, calm and venomous, conscious of power, greetedwith a roar. "Yesterday the Military Revolutionary Committee decidedto release the Socialist Revolutionary and Menshevik Ministers,Mazlov, Salazkin, Gvozdov and Maliantovitch-on principle. That theyare still in Peter-Paul is only because we have had so much to do....They will, however, be detained at their homes under arrest until wehave investigated their complicity in the treacherous acts ofKerensky during the Kornilov affair!""Never," shouted Pianikh, "in any revolution have such things beenseen as go on here!""You are mistaken," responded Trotzky. "Such things have been seeneven in this revolution. Hundreds of our comrades were arrested inthe July days.... When Comrade Kollontai was released from prison bythe doctor's orders, Avksentiev placed at her door two former agentsof the Tsar's secret police!" The peasants withdrew, muttering,followed by ironical hoots.The representative of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries spoke onthe Land Decree. While agreeing in principle, his faction could notvote on the question until after discussion. The Peasants' Sovietsshould be consulted....The Mensheviki Internationalists, too, insisted on a party caucus.Then the leader of the Maximalists, the Anarchist wing of thepeasants: "We must do honour to a political party which puts such anact into effect the first day, without jawing about it!"A typical peasant was in the tribune, long hair, boots andsheep-skin coat, bowing to all corners of the hall. "I wish youwell, comrades and citizens," he said. "There are some Cadetswalking around outside. You arrested our Socialist peasants-why notarrest them?"This was the signal for a debate of excited peasants. It wasprecisely like the debate of soldiers of the night before. Here werethe real proletarians of the land...."Those members of our Executive Committee, Avksentiev and the rest,whom we thought were the peasants' protectors-they are only Cadetstoo! Arrest them! Arrest them!"Another, "Who are these Pianikhs, these Avksentievs? They are notpeasants at all! They only wag their tails!"How the crowd rose to them, recognising brothers!The Left Socialist Revolutionaries proposed a half-hourintermission. As the delegates streamed out, Lenin stood up in hisplace."We must not lose time, comrades! News all-important to Russia mustbe on the press to-morrow morning. No delay!"And above the hot discussion, argument, shuffling of feet could beheard the voice of an emissary of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, crying, "Fifteen agitators wanted in room 17 at once! Togo to the Front!"hellip;It was almost two hours and a half later that the delegates camestraggling back, the presidium mounted the platform, and the sessionrecommenced by the reading of telegrams from regiment afterregiment, announcing their adhesion to the Military RevolutionaryCommittee.In leisurely manner the meeting gathered momentum. A delegate fromthe Russian troops on the Macedonian front spoke bitterly of theirsituation. "We suffer there more from the friendship of our 'Allies'than from the enemy," he said. Representatives of the Tenth andTwelfth Armies, just arrived in hot haste, reported, "We support youwith all our strength!" A peasant-soldier protested against therelease of "the traitor Socialists, Mazlov and Salazkin"; as for theExecutive Committee of the Peasants' Soviets, it should be arrested_en masse!_Here was real revolutionary talk.... A deputy from theRussian Army in Persia declared he was instructed to demand allpower to the Soviets.... A Ukrainean officer, speaking in his nativetongue: "There is no nationalism in this crisis.... _Da zdravstvuyet_the proletarian dictatorship of all lands!" Such a deluge of highand hot thoughts that surely Russia would never again be dumb!Kameniev remarked that the anti-Bolshevik forces were trying to stirup disorders everywhere, and read an appeal of the Congress to allthe Soviets of Russia:The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies, including some Peasants' Deputies, calls upon the localSoviets to take immediate energetic measures to oppose allcounter-revolutionary anti-Jewish action and all _pogroms,_ whateverthey may be. The honour of the Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers'Revolution demands that no _pogrom_ be tolerated.The Red Guard of Petrograd, the revolutionary garrison and thesailors have maintained complete order in the capital.Workers, soldiers and peasants, you should follow everywhere theexample of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd.Comrade soldiers and Cossacks, on us falls the duty of assuring realrevolutionary order.All revolutionary Russia and the entire world have their eyes on us....At two o'clock the Land Decree was put to vote, with only oneagainst and the peasant delegates wild with joy.... So plunged theBolsheviki ahead, irresistible, over-riding hesitation andopposition-the only people in Russia who had a definite programme ofaction while the others talked for eight long months.Now arose a soldier, gaunt, ragged and eloquent, to protest againstthe clause of the _nakaz_ tending to deprive military deserters froma share in village land allotments. Bawled at and hissed at first,his simple, moving speech finally made silence. "Forced against hiswill into the butchery of the trenches," he cried, "which youyourselves, in the Peace decree, have voted senseless as well ashorrible, he greeted the Revolution with hope of peace and freedom.Peace? The Government of Kerensky forced him again to go forwardinto Galicia to slaughter and be slaughtered; to his pleas forpeace, Terestchenko simply laughed.... Freedom? Under Kerensky hefound his Committees suppressed, his newspapers cut off, his partyspeakers put in prison.... At home in his village, the landlords weredefying his Land Committees, jailing his comrades.... In Petrograd thebourgeoisie, in alliance with the Germans, were sabotaging the foodand ammunition for the Army.... He was without boots, or clothes.... Whoforced him to desert? The Government of Kerensky, which you haveoverthrown!" At the end there was applause.But another soldier hotly denounced it: "The Government of Kerenskyis not a screen behind which can be hidden dirty work likedesertion! Deserters are scoundrels, who run away home and leavetheir comrades to die in the trenches alone! Every deserter is atraitor, and should be punished...." Uproar, shouts of _"Do volno!Teesche!"_ Kameniev hastily proposed to leave the matter to theGovernment for decision. (See App. V, Sect. 4)At 2.30 A. M. fell a tense hush. Kameniev was reading the decree ofthe Constitution of Power:Until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly, a provisionalWorkers' and Peasants' Government is formed, which shall be namedthe Council of People's Commissars. (See App. V, Sect. 5)The administration of the different branches of state activity shallbe intrusted to commissions, whose composition shall be regulated toensure the carrying out of the programme of the Congress, in closeunion with the mass-organisations of working-men, working-women,sailors, soldiers, peasants and clerical employees. The governmentalpower is vested in a _collegium_ made up of the chairmen of thesecommissions, that is to say, the Council of People's Commissars.Control over the activities of the People's Commissars, and theright to replace them, shall belong to the All-Russian Congress ofSoviets of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies, and itsCentral Executive Committee.Still silence; as he read the list of Commissars, bursts of applauseafter each name, Lenin's and Trotzky's especially._President of the Council:_ Vladimir Ulianov _(Lenin)__Interior:_ A. E. Rykov_Agriculture:_ V. P. Miliutin_Labour:_ A. G. Shliapnikov_Military and Naval Affairs_-a committee composed of V. A._Avseenko (Antonov),_ N. V. Krylenko, and F. M. Dybenko._Commerce and Industry:_ V. P. Nogin_Popular Education:_ A. V. Lunatcharsky_Finance:_ E. E. Skvortsov _(Stepanov)__Foreign Affairs:_ L. D. Bronstein _(Trotzky)__Justice:_ G. E. Oppokov _(Lomov)__Supplies:_ E. A. Teodorovitch_Post and Telegraph:_ N. P. Avilov _(Gliebov)__Chairman for Nationalities:_ I. V. Djougashvili _(Stalin)__Railroads:_ To be filled later.There were bayonets at the edges of the room, bayonets pricking upamong the delegates; the Military Revolutionary Committee was armingeverybody, Bolshevism was arming for the decisive battle withKerensky, the sound of whose trumpets came up the south-west wind....In the meanwhile nobody went home; on the contrary hundreds ofnewcomers filtered in, filling the great room solid with stern-facedsoldiers and workmen who stood for hours and hours, indefatigablyintent. The air was thick with cigarette smoke, and human breathing,and the smell of coarse clothes and sweat.Avilov of the staff of _Novaya Zhizn_ was speaking in the name ofthe Social Democrat Internationalists and the remnant of theMensheviki Internationalists; Avilov, with his young, intelligentface, looking out of place in his smart frock-coat."We must ask ourselves where we are going.... The ease with which theCoalition Government was upset cannot be explained by the strengthof the left wing of the democracy, but only by the incapacity of theGovernment to give the people peace and bread. And the left wingcannot maintain itself in power unless it can solve these questions...."Can it give bread to the people? Grain is scarce. The majority ofthe peasants will not be with you, for you cannot give them themachinery they need. Fuel and other primary necessities are almostimpossible to procure...."As for peace, that will be even more difficult. The allies refusedto talk with Skobeliev. They will never accept the proposition of apeace conference from _you._ You will not be recognised either inLondon and Paris, or in Berlin...."You cannot count on the effective help of the proletariat of theAllied countries, because in most countries it is very far from therevolutionary struggle; remember, the Allied democracy was unableeven to convoke the Stockholm Conference. Concerning the GermanSocial Democrats, I have just talked with Comrade Goldenberg, one ofour delegates to Stockholm; he was told by the representatives ofthe Extreme Left that revolution in Germany was impossible duringthe war...." Here interruptions began to come thick and fast, butAvilov kept on."The isolation of Russia will fatally result either in the defeat ofthe Russian Army by the Germans, and the patching up of a peacebetween the Austro-German coalition and the Franco-British coalition_at the expense of Russia_-or in a separate peace with Germany."I have just learned that the Allied ambassadors are preparing toleave, and that Committees for Salvation of Country and Revolutionare forming in all the cities of Russia...."No one party can conquer these enormous difficulties. The majorityof the people, supporting a government of Socialist coalition, canalone accomplish the Revolution...."He then read the resolution of the two factions:Recognising that for the salvation of the conquests of theRevolution it is indispensable immediately to constitute agovernment based on the revolutionary democracy organised in theSoviets of Workers,' Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, recognisingmoreover that the task of this government is the quickest possibleattainment of peace, the transfer of the land into the hands of theagrarian committees, the organisation of control over industrialproduction, and the convocation of the Constituent Assembly on thedate decided, the Congress appoints an executive committee toconstitute such a government after an agreement with the groups ofthe democracy which are taking part in the Congress.In spite of the revolutionary exaltation of the triumphant crowd,Avilov's cool tolerant reasoning had shaken them. Toward the end,the cries and hisses died away, and when he finished there was evensome clapping.Karelin followed him-also young, fearless, whose sincerity no onedoubted-for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, the party of MariaSpiridonova, the party which almost alone followed the Bolsheviki,and which represented the revolutionary peasants."Our party has refused to enter the Council of People's Commissarsbecause we do not wish forever to separate ourselves from the partof the revolutionary army which left the Congress, a separationwhich would make it impossible for us to serve as intermediariesbetween the Bolsheviki and the other groups of the democracy.... Andthat is our principal duty at this moment. We cannot sustain anygovernment except a government of Socialist coalition...."We protest, moreover, against the tyrannical conduct of theBolsheviki. Our Commissars have been driven from their posts. Ouronly organ, _Znamia Truda_ (Banner of Labour), was forbidden toappear yesterday...."The Central Duma is forming a powerful Committee for Salvation ofCountry and Revolution, to fight you. Already you are isolated, andyour Government is without the support of a single other democraticgroup....And now Trotzky stood upon the raised tribune, confident anddominating, with that sarcastic expression about his mouth which wasalmost a sneer. He spoke, in a ringing voice, and the great crowdrose to him."These considerations on the dangers of isolation of our party arenot new. On the eve of insurrection our fatal defeat was alsopredicted. Everybody was against us; only a faction of the SocialistRevolutionaries of the left was with us in the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee. How is it that we were able to overturn theGovernment almost without bloodshed?.... That fact is the moststriking proof that we _were not isolated._ In reality theProvisional Government was isolated; the democratic parties whichmarch against us were isolated, are isolated, and forever cut offfrom the proletariat!"They speak of the necessity for a coalition. There is only onecoalition possible-the coalition of the workers, soldiers andpoorest peasants; and it is our party's honour to have realised thatcoalition.... What sort of coalition did Avilov mean? A coalition withthose who supported the Government of Treason to the People?Coalition doesn't always add to strength. For example, could we haveorganised the insurrection with Dan and Avksentiev in our ranks?"Roars of laughter."Avksentiev gave little bread. Will a coalition with the _oborontsi_furnish more? Between the peasants and Avksentiev, who ordered thearrest of the Land Committees, we choose the peasants! OurRevolution will remain the classic revolution of history...."They accuse us of repelling an agreement with the other democraticparties. But is it we who are to blame? Or must we, as Karelin putit, blame it on a 'misunderstanding'? No, comrades. When a party infull tide of revolution, still wreathed in powder-smoke, comes tosay, 'Here is the Power-take it!'-and when those to whom it isoffered go over to the enemy, that is not a misunderstanding.... thatis a declaration of pitiless war. And it isn't we who have declaredwar...."Avilov menaces us with failure of our peace efforts-if we remain'isolated.' I repeat, I don't see how a coalition with Skobeliev, oreven Terestchenko, can help us to get peace! Avilov tries tofrighten us by the threat of a peace at our expense. And I answerthat in any case, if Europe continues to be ruled by the imperialistbourgeoisie, revolutionary Russia will inevitably be lost...."There are only two alternatives; either the Russian Revolution willcreate a revolutionary movement in Europe, or the European powerswill destroy the Russian Revolution!"They greeted him with an immense crusading acclaim, kindling to thedaring of it, with the thought of championing mankind. And from thatmoment there was something conscious and decided about theinsurrectionary masses, in all their actions, which never left them.But on the other side, too, battle was taking form. Kamenievrecognised a delegate from the Union of Railway Workers, ahardfaced, stocky man with an attitude of implacable hostility. Hethrew a bombshell."In the name of the strongest organisation in Russia I demand theright to speak, and I say to you: the _Vikzhel_charges me to makeknown the decision of the Union concerning the constitution ofPower. The Central Committee refuses absolutely to support theBolsheviki if they persist in isolating themselves from the wholedemocracy of Russia!" Immense tumult all over the hall."In 1905, and in the Kornilov days, the Railway Workers were thebest defenders of the Revolution. But you did not invite us to yourCongress-" Cries, "It was the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ which did not inviteyou!" The orator paid no attention. "We do not recognise thelegality of this Congress; since the departure of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries there is not a legal quorum.... The Unionsupports the old _Tsay-ee-Kah,_ and declares that the Congress hasno right to elect a new Committee...."The Power should be a Socialist and revolutionary Power,responsible before the authorised organs of the entire revolutionarydemocracy. Until the constitution of such a power, the Union ofRailway Workers, which refuses to transport counter-revolutionarytroops to Petrograd, at the same time forbids the execution of anyorder whatever without the consent of the _Vikzhel._ The _Vikzhel_also takes into its hands the entire administration of the railroadsof Russia."At the end he could hardly be heard for the furious storm of abusewhich beat upon him. But it was a heavy blow-that could be seen inthe concern on the faces of the presidium. Kameniev, however, merelyanswered that there could be no doubt of the legality of theCongress, as even the quorum established by the old _Tsay-ee-Kah_was exceeded-in spite of the secession of the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolution arises....Then came the vote on the Constitution of Power, which carried theCouncil of People's Commissars into office by an enormous majority....The election of the new _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the new parliament of theRussian Republic, took barely fifteen minutes. Trotzky announced itscomposition: 100 members, of which 70 Bolsheviki.... As for thepeasants, and the seceding factions, places were to be reserved forthem. "We welcome into the Government all parties and groups whichwill adopt our programme," ended Trotzky.And thereupon the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets wasdissolved, so that the members might hurry to their homes in thefour corners of Russia and tell of the great happenings....It was almost seven when we woke the sleeping conductors andmotor-men of the street-cars which the Street-Railway Workers' Unionalways kept waiting at Smolny to take the Soviet delegates to theirhomes. In the crowded car there was less happy hilarity than thenight before, I thought. Many looked anxious; perhaps they weresaying to themselves, "Now we are masters, how can we do our will?"At our apartment-house we were held up in the dark by an armedpatrol of citizens and carefully examined. The Duma's proclamationwas doing its work....The landlady heard us come in, and stumbled out in a pink silkwrapper.The House Committee has again asked that you take your turn onguard-duty with the rest of the men," she said."What's the reason for this guard-duty?""To protect the house and the women and children.""Who from?""Robbers and murderers.""But suppose there came a Commissar from the Military RevolutionaryCommittee to search for arms?""Oh, that's what they'll _say_ they are.... And besides, what's thedifference?"I solemnly affirmed that the Consul had forbidden all Americancitizens to carry arms-especially in the neighbourhood of theRussian _intelligentzia_....                              Chapter VI                      The Committee for SalvationFRIDAY, November 9th....Novotcherkask, November 8th.In view of the revolt of the Bolsheviki, and their attempt to deposethe Provisional Government and to seize the power in Petrograd... theCossack Government declares that it considers these acts criminaland absolutely inadmissible. In consequence, the Cossacks will lendall their support to the Provisional Government, which is agovernment of coalition. Because of these circumstances, and untilthe return of the Provisional Government to power, and therestoration of order in Russia, I take upon myself, beginningNovember 7th, all the power in that which concerns the region of theDon.Signed: ATAMAN KALEDIN_President of the Government of the Cossack Troops.__Prikaz_ of the Minister-President Kerensky, dated at Gatchina:I, Minister-President of the Provisional Government, and SupremeCommander of all the armed forces of the Russian Republic, declarethat I am at the head of regiments from the Front who have remainedfaithful to the fatherland.I order all the troops of the Military District of Petrograd, whothrough mistake or folly have answered the appeal of the traitors tothe country and the Revolution, to return to their duty withoutdelay.This order shall be read in all regiments, battalions and squadrons.Signed: _Minister-President of the Provisional__Government and Supreme Commander_A. F. KERENSKY.Telegram from Kerensky to the General in Command of the NorthernFront:The town of Gatchina has been taken by the loyal regiments withoutbloodshed. Detachments of Cronstadt sailors, and of the Semionovskyand Ismailovsky regiments, gave up their arms without resistance andjoined the Government troops.I order all the designated units to advance as quickly as possible.The Military Revolutionary Committee has ordered its troops toretreat....Gatchina, about thirty kilometers south-west, had fallen during thenight. Detachments of the two regiments mentioned-not thesailors-while wandering captainless in the neighbourhood, had indeedbeen surrounded by Cossacks and given up their arms; but it was nottrue that they had joined the Government troops. At this very momentcrowds of them, bewildered and ashamed, were up at Smolny trying toexplain. They did not think the Cossacks were so near.... They hadtried to argue with the Cossacks....Apparently the greatest confusion prevailed along the revolutionaryfront. The garrisons of all the little towns southward had splithopelessly, bitterly into two factions-or three: the high commandbeing on the side of Kerensky, in default of anything stronger, themajority of the rank and file with the Soviets, and the restunhappily wavering.Hastily the Military Revolutionary Committee appointed to commandthe defence of Petrograd an ambitious regular Army Captain,Muraviov, the same Muraviov who had organised the Death Battalionsduring the summer, and had once been heard to advise the Governmentthat "it was too lenient with the Bolsheviki; they must be wipedout." A man of military mind, who admired power and audacity,perhaps sincerely....Beside my door when I came down in the morning were posted two neworders of the Military Revolutionary Committee, directing that allshops and stores should open as usual, and that all empty rooms andapartments should be put at the disposal of the Committee....For thirty-six hours now the Bolsheviki had been cut off fromprovincial Russia and the outside world. The railway men andtelegraphers refused to transmit their despatches, the postmen wouldnot handle their mail. Only the Government wireless at TsarskoyeSelo launched half-hourly bulletins and manifestoes to the fourcorners of heaven; the Commissars of Smolny raced the Commissars ofthe City Duma on speeding trains half across the earth; and twoaeroplanes, laden with propaganda, fled high up toward the Front....But the eddies of insurrection were spreading through Russia with aswiftness surpassing any human agency. Helsingfors Soviet passedresolutions of support; Kiev Bolsheviki captured the arsenal and thetelegraph station, only to be driven out by delegates to theCongress of Cossacks, which happened to be meeting there; in Kazan,a Military Revolutionary Committee arrested the local garrison staffand the Commissar of the Provisional Government; from farKrasnoyarsk, in Siberia, came news that the Soviets were in controlof the Municipal institutions; at Moscow, where the situation wasaggravated by a great strike of leather-workers on one side, and athreat of general lock-out on the other, the Soviets had votedoverwhelmingly to support the action of the Bolsheviki inPetrograd.... Already a Military Revolutionary Committee wasfunctioning.Everywhere the same thing happened. The common soldiers and theindustrial workers supported the Soviets by a vast majority; theofficers, _yunkers_ and middle class generally were on the side ofthe Government-as were the bourgeois Cadets and the "moderate"Socialist parties. In all these towns sprang up Committees forSalvation of Country and Revolution, arming for civil war....Vast Russia was in a state of solution. As long ago as 1905 theprocess had begun; the March Revolution had merely hastened it, andgiving birth to a sort of forecast of the new order, had ended bymerely perpetuating the hollow structure of the old regime. Now,however, the Bolsheviki, in one night, had dissipated it, as oneblows away smoke. Old Russia was no more; human society flowedmolten in primal heat, and from the tossing sea of flame wasemerging the class struggle, stark and pitiless-and the fragile,slowly-cooling crust of new planets....In Petrograd sixteen Ministries were on strike, led by theMinistries of Labour and of Supplies-the only two created by theall-Socialist Government of August.If ever men stood alone the "handful of Bolsheviki" apparently stoodalone that grey chill morning, with all storms towering over them.(See App. VI, Sect. 1) Back against the wall, the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee struck-for its life. _"De l'audace, encorede l'audace, et toujours de l'audace_.... At five in the morning theRed Guards entered the printing office of the City Government,confiscated thousands of copies of the Appeal-Protest of the Duma,and suppressed the official Municipal organ-the _Viestnik GorodskovoSamoupravleniya_ (Bulletin of the Municipal Self-Government). Allthe bourgeois newspapers were torn from the presses, even the _GolosSoldata,_ journal of the old _Tsay-ee-kah_-which, however, changingits name to _Soldatski Golos,_ appeared in an edition of a hundredthousand copies, bellowing rage and defiance:The men who began their stroke of treachery in the night, who havesuppressed the newspapers, will not keep the country in ignorancelong. The country will know the truth! It will appreciate you,Messrs. the Bolsheviki! We shall see!...As we came down the Nevsky a little after midday the whole streetbefore the Duma building was crowded with people. Here and therestood Red Guards and sailors, with bayonetted rifles, each onesurrounded by about a hundred men and women-clerks, students,shopkeepers, _tchinovniki_-shaking their fists and bawling insultsand menaces. On the steps stood boy-scouts and officers,distributing copies of the _Soldatski Golos._ A workman with a redband around his arm and a revolver in his hand stood trembling withrage and nervousness in the middle of a hostile throng at the footof the stairs, demanding the surrender of the papers.... Nothing likethis, I imagine, ever occurred in history. On one side a handful ofworkmen and common soldiers, with arms in their hands, representinga victorious insurrection-and perfectly miserable; on the other afrantic mob made up of the kind of people that crowd the sidewalksof Fifth Avenue at noon-time, sneering, abusing, shouting,"Traitors! Provocators! _Opritchniki!_ [*]"[* Savage body-guards if Ian the Terrible, 17th century]The doors were guarded by students and officers with white arm-bandslettered in red, "Militia of the Committee of Public Safety," andhalf a dozen boy-scouts came and went. Upstairs the place was allcommotion. Captain Gomberg was coming down the stairs. "They'regoing to dissolve the Duma," he said. "The Bolshevik Commissar iswith the Mayor now." As we reached the top Riazanov came hurryingout. He had been to demand that the Duma recognise the Council ofpeoples' Commissars, and the Mayor had given him a flat refusal.In the offices a great babbling crowd, hurrying, shouting,gesticulating-Government officials, intellectuals, journalists,foreign correspondents, French and British officers.... "The CityEngineer pointed to them triumphantly. "The Embassies recognise theDuma as the only power now," he explained. "For these Bolshevikmurderers and robbers it is only a question of hours. All Russia israllying to us....In the Alexander Hall a monster meeting of the Committee forSalvation. Fillipovsky in the chair and Skobeliev again in thetribune, reporting, to immense applause, new adhesions to theCommittee; Executive Committee of Peasants' Soviets, old_Tsay-ee-kah,_ Central Army Committee, _Tsentroflot,_ Menshevik,Socialist Revolutionary and Front group delegates from the Congressof Soviets, Central Committees of the Menshevik, SocialistRevolutionary, Populist Socialist parties. "Yedinstvo" group,Peasants' Union, Cooperatives, Zemstvos, Municipalities, Post andTelegraph Unions, _Vikzhel,_ Council of the Russian Republic, Unionof Unions,  [*] Merchants' and Manufacturers' Association....[* See Notes and Explanations.]".... The power of the Soviets is not democratic power, but adictatorship-and not the dictatorship of the proletariat, but_against_ the proletariat. All those who have felt or know how tofeel revolutionary enthusiasm must join now for the defence of theRevolution...."The problem of the day is not only to render harmless irresponsibledemagogues, but to fight against the counter-revolution.... If rumoursare true that certain generals in the provinces are attempting toprofit by events in order to march on Petrograd with other designs,it is only one more proof that we must establish a solid base ofdemocratic government. Otherwise, troubles with the Right willfollow troubles from the Left...."The garrison of Petrograd cannot remain indifferent when citizensbuying the _Golos Soldata_ and newsboys selling the _RabotchayaGazeta_ are arrested in the streets...."The hour of resolutions has passed.... Let those who have no longerfaith in the Revolution retire.... To establish a united power, wemust again restore the prestige of the Revolution...."Let us swear that either the Revolution shall be saved-or we shallperish!"The hall rose, cheering, with kindling eyes. There was not a singleproletarian anywhere in sight....Then Weinstein:"We must remain calm, and not act until public opinion is firmlygrouped in support of the Committee for Salvation-then we can passfrom the defensive to action!"The _Vikzhel_ representative announced that his organisation wastaking the initiative in forming the new Government, and itsdelegates were now discussing the matter with Smolny.... Followed ahot discussion: were the Bolsheviki to be admitted to the newGovernment? Martov pleaded for their admission; after all, he said,they represented an important political party. Opinions were verymuch divided upon this, the right wing Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries, as well as the Populist Socialists, theCooperatives and the bourgeois elements being bitterly against...."They have betrayed Russia," one speaker said. "They have startedcivil war and opened the front to the Germans. The Bolsheviki mustbe mercilessly crushed...."Skobeliev was in favor of excluding both the Bolsheviki and theCadets.We got into conversation with a young Socialist Revolutionary, whohad walked out of the Democratic Conference to gether with theBolsheviki, that night when Tseretelli and the "compromisers" forcedCoalition upon the democracy of Russia."You here?" I asked him.His eyes flashed fire. "Yes!" he cried. "I left the Congress with myparty Wednesday night. I have not risked my life for twenty yearsand more to submit now to the tyranny of the Dark People. Theirmethods are intolerable. But they have not counted on the peasants....When the peasants begin to act, then it is a question of minutesbefore they are done for.""But the peasants-will they act? Doesn't the Land decree settle thepeasants? What more do they want?""Ah, the Land decree!" he said furiously. "Yes, do you know whatthat Land decree is? It is _our_ decree-it is the SocialistRevolutionary programme, intact! My party framed that policy, afterthe most careful compilation of the wishes of the peasantsthemselves. It is an outrage....""But if it is your own policy, why do you object? If it is thepeasants' wishes, why will they oppose it?""You don't understand! Don't you see that the peasants willimmediately realise that it is all a trick-that these usurpers havestolen the Socialist Revolutionary programme?"I asked if it were true that Kaledin was marching north.He nodded, and rubbed his hands with a sort of bitter satisfaction."Yes. Now you see what these Bolsheviki have done. They have raisedthe counter-revolution against us. The Revolution is lost. TheRevolution is lost.""But won't you defend the Revolution?""Of course we will defend it-to the last drop of our blood. But wewon't cooperate with the Bolsheviki in any way....""But if Kaledin comes to Petrograd, and the Bolsheviki defend thecity. Won't you join with them?""Of course not. We will defend the city also, but we won't supportthe Bolsheviki. Kaledin is the enemy of the Revolution, but theBolsheviki are equally enemies of the Revolution.""Which do you prefer-Kaledin or the Bolsheviki?""It is not a question to be discussed!" he burst out impatiently. "Itell you, the Revolution is lost. And it is the Bolsheviki who areto blame. But listen-why should we talk of such things? Kerensky iscomming.... Day after tomorrow we shall pass to the offensive....Already Smolny has sent delegates inviting us to form a newGovernment. But we have them now-they are absolutely impotent.... Weshall not cooperate...."Outside there was a shot. We ran to the windows. A Red Guard,finally exasperated by the taunts of the crowd, had shot into it,wounding a young girl in the arm. We could see her being lifted intoa cab, surrounded by an excited throng, the clamour of whose voicesfloated up to us. As we looked, suddenly an armoured automobileappeared around the corner of the Mikhailovsky, its guns sluing thisway and that. Immediately the crowd began to run, as Petrogradcrowds do, falling down and lying still in the street, piled in thegutters, heaped up behind telephone-poles. The car lumbered up tothe steps of the Duma and a man stuck his head out of the turret,demanding the surrender of the _Soldatski Golos._ The boy-scoutsjeered and scuttled into the building. After a moment the automobilewheeled undecidedly around and went off up the Nevsky, while somehundreds of men and women picked themselves up and began to dusttheir clothes....Inside was a prodigious running-about of people with armfuls of_Soldatski Golos,_ looking for places to hide them....A journalist came running into the room, waving a paper."Here's a proclamation from Krasnov!" he cried. Everybody crowdedaround. "Get it printed-get it printed quick, and around to thebarracks!"By the order of the Supreme Commander I am appointed commandant ofthe troops concentrated under Petrograd.Citizens, soldiers, valorous Cossacks of the Don, of the Kuban, ofthe Transbaikal, of the Amur, of the Yenissei, to all you who haveremained faithful to your oath I appeal; to you who have sworn toguard inviolable your oath of Cossack-I call upon you to savePetrograd from anarchy, from famine, from tyranny, and to saveRussia from the indelible shame to which a handful of ignorant men,bought by the gold of Wilhelm, are trying to submit her.The Provisional Government, to which you swore fidelity in the greatdays of March, is not overthrown, but by violence expelled from theedifice in which it held its meetings. However the Government, withthe help of the Front armies, faithful to their duty, with the helpof the Council of Cossacks, which has united under its command allthe Cossacks and which, strong with the morale which reigns in itsranks, and acting in accordance with the will of the Russian people,has sworn to serve the country as its ancestors served it in theTroublous Times of 1612, when the Cossacks of the Don deliveredMoscow, menaced by the Swedes, the Poles, and the Lithuanians. YourGovernment still exists....The active army considers these criminals with horror and contempt.Their acts of vandalism and pillage, their crimes, the Germanmentality with which they regard Russia-stricken down but not yetsurrendered-have alienated from them the entire people.Citizens, soldiers, valorous Cossacks of the garrison of Petrograd;send me your delegates so that I may know who are traitors to theircountry and who are not, that there may be avoided an effusion ofinnocent blood.Almost the same moment word ran from group to group that thebuilding was surrounded by Red Guards. An officer strode in, a redband around his arm, demanding the Mayor. A few minutes later heleft and old Schreider came out of his office, red and pale by turns."A special meeting of the Duma!" he cried. "Immediately!"In the big hall proceedings were halted. "All members of the Dumafor a special meeting!""What's the matter?""I don't know-going to arrest us-going to dissolve theDuma-arresting members at the door-" so ran the excited comments.In the Nicolai Hall there was barely room to stand. The Mayorannounced that troops were stationed at all the doors, prohibitingall exit and entrance, and that a Commissar had threatened arrestand the dispersal of the Municipal Duma. A flood of impassionedspeeches from members, and even from the galleries, responded. Thefreely-elected City Government could not be dissolved by _any_power; the Mayor's person and that of all the members wereinviolable; the tyrants, the provocators, the German agents shouldnever be recognised; as for these threats to dissolve us, let themtry-only over our dead bodies shall they seize this chamber, wherelike the Roman senators of old we await with dignity the coming ofthe Goths....Resolution, to inform the Dumas and Zemstvos of all Russia bytelegraph. Resolution, that it was impossible for the Mayor or theChairman of the Duma to enter into any relations whatever withrepresentatives of the Military Revolutionary Committee or with theso-called Council of People's Commissars. Resolution, to addressanother appeal to the population of Petrograd to stand up for thedefence of their elected town government. Resolution, to remain inpermanent session....In the meanwhile one member arrived with the information that he hadtelephoned to Smolny, and that the Military Revolutionary Committeesaid that no orders had been given to surround the Duma, that thetroops would be withdrawn....As we went downstairs Riazanov burst in through the front door, veryagitated."Are you going to dissolve the Duma?" I asked."My God, no!" he answered. "It is all a mistake. I told the Mayorthis morning that the Duma would be left alone....Out on the Nevsky, in the deepening dusk, a long double file ofcyclists came riding, guns slung on their shoulders. They halted,and the crowd pressed in and deluged them with questions."Who are you? Where do you come from?" asked a fat old man with acigar in his mouth."Twelfth Army. From the front. We came to support the Sovietsagainst the damn' bourgeoisie!""Ah!" were furious cries. "Bolshevik gendarmes! Bolshevik Cossacks!"A little officer in a leather coat came running down the steps. "Thegarrison is turning!" he muttered in my ear. "It's the beginning ofthe end of the Bolsheviki. Do you want to see the turn of the tide?Come on!" He started at a half-trot up the Mikhailovsky, and wefollowed."What regiment is it?""The _brunnoviki_...." Here was indeed serious trouble. The_brunnoviki_ were the Armoured Car troops, the key to the situation;whoever controlled the _brunnoviki_ controlled the city. "TheCommissars of the Committee for Salvation and the Duma have beentalking to them. There's a meeting on to decide...."Decide what? Which side they'll fight on?""Oh, no. That's not the way to do it. They'll never fight againstthe Bolsheviki. They will vote to remain neutral-and then the_yunkers_ and Cossacks-"The door of the great Mikhailovsky Riding-School yawned blackly. Twosentinels tried to stop us, but we brushed by hurriedly, deaf totheir indignant expostulations. Inside only a single arc-lightburned dimly, high up near the roof of the enormous hall, whoselofty pilasters and rows of windows vanished in the gloom. Arounddimly squatted the monstrous shapes of the armoured cars. One stoodalone in the centre of the place, under the light, and round it weregathered some two thousand dun-colored soldiers, almost lost in theimmensity of that imperial building. A dozen men, officers, chairmenof the Soldiers' Committees and speakers, were perched on top of thecar, and from the central turret a soldier was speaking. This wasKhanjunov, who had been president of last summer's all-RussianCongress of _Brunnoviki._ A lithe, handsome figure in his leathercoat with lieutenant's shoulder-straps, he stood pleading eloquentlyfor neutrality."It is an awful thing," he said, "for Russians to kill their Russianbrothers. There must not be civil war between soldiers who stoodshoulder to shoulder against the Tsar, and conquered the foreignenemy in battles which will go down in history! What have we,soldiers, got to do with these squabbles of political parties? Iwill not say to you that the Provisional Government was a democraticGovernment; we want no coalition with the bourgeoisie-no. But wemust have a Government of the united democracy, or Russia is lost!With such a Government there will be no need for civil war, and thekilling of brother by brother!"This sounded reasonable-the great hall echoed to the crash of handsand voices.A soldier climbed up, his face white and strained, "Comrades!" hecried, "I came from the Rumanian front, to urgently tell you all:there must be peace! Peace at once! Whoever can give us peace,whether it be the Bolsheviki or this new Government, we will follow.Peace! We at the front cannot fight any longer. We cannot fighteither Germans or Russians-" With that he leaped down, and a sort ofconfused agonised sound rose up from all that surging mass, whichburst into something like anger when the next speaker, a Menshevik_oboronetz,_ tried to say that the war must go on until the Allieswere victorious."You talk like Kerensky!" shouted a rough voice.A Duma delegate, pleading for neutrality. Him they listened to,muttering uneasily, feeling him not one of them. Never have I seenmen trying so hard to understand, to decide. They never moved, stoodstaring with a sort of terrible intentness at the speaker, theirbrows wrinkled with the effort of thought, sweat standing out ontheir foreheads; great giants of men with the innocent clear eyes ofchildren and the faces of epic warriors....Now a Bolshevik was speaking, one of their own men, violently, fullof hate. They liked him no more than the other. It was not theirmood. For the moment they were lifted out of the ordinary run ofcommon thoughts, thinking in terms of Russia, of Socialism, theworld, as if it depended on them whether the Revolution were to liveor die....Speaker succeeded speaker, debating amid tense silence, roars ofapproval, or anger: should we come out or not? Khanjunov returned,persuasive and sympathetic. But wasn't he an officer, and an_oboronotz,_ however much he talked of peace? Then a workman fromVasili Ostrov, but him they greeted with, "And are _you_ going togive us peace, working-man?" Near us some men, many of themofficers, formed a sort of _claque_ to cheer the advocates ofNeutrality. They kept shouting, "Khanjunov! Khanjunov!" and whistledinsultingly when the Bolsheviki tried to speak.Suddenly the committeemen and officers on top of the automobilebegan to discuss something with great heat and much gesticulation.The audience shouted to know what was the matter, and all the greatmass tossed and stirred. A soldier, held back by one of theofficers, wrenched himself loose and held up his hand."Comrades!" he cried, "Comrade Krylenko is here and wants to speakto us." An outburst of cheers, whistlings, yells of _"Prosim!Prosim! Dolby!_ Go ahead! Go ahead! Down with him!" in the midst ofwhich the People's Commissar for Military Affairs clambered up theside of the car, helped by hands before and behind, pushed andpulled from below and above. Rising he stood for a moment, and thenwalked out on the radiator, put his hands on his hips and lookedaround smiling, a squat, short-legged figure, bare-headed, with-outinsignia on his uniform.The _claque_ near me kept up a fearful shouting, "Khanjunov! We wantKhanjunov! Down with him! Shut up! Down with the traitor!" The wholeplace seethed and roared. Then it began to move, like an avalanchebearing down upon us, great black-browed men forcing their waythrough."Who is breaking up our meeting?" they shouted. "Who is whistlinghere?" The _claque,_ rudely burst asunder, went flying-nor did itgather again...."Comrade soliders!" began Krylenko, in a voice husky with fatigue."I cannot speak well to you; I am sorry; but I have not had anysleep for four nights...."I don't need to tell you that I am a soldier. I don't need to tellyou that I want peace. What I must say is that the Bolshevik party,successful in the Workers' and Soldiers' Revolution, by the help ofyou and of all the rest of the brave comrades who have of you and ofall the rest of the brave comrades who have hurled down forever thepower of the blood-thirsty bourgeoisie, promised to offer peace toall the peoples, and that has already been done-to-day!" Tumultuousapplause."You are asked to remain neutral--to remain neutral while the_yunkers_ and the Death Battalions, who are _never_ neutral, shootus down in the streets and bring back to Petrograd Kerensky-orperhaps some other of the gang. Kaledin is marching from the Don.Kerensky is coming from the front. Kornilov is raising the_Tekhintsi_ to repeat his attempt of August. All these Menshevikiand Socialist Revolutionaries who call upon you now to prevent civilwar-how have they retained the power except by civil war, that civilwar which has endured ever since last July, and in which theyconstantly stood on the side of the bourgeoisie, as they do now?"How can I persuade you, if you have made up your minds? Thequestion is very plain. On one side are Kerensky, Kaledin, Kornilov,the Mensheviki, Socialist Revolutionaries, Cadets, Dumas, officers....They tell us that their objects are good. On the other side are theworkers, the soldiers and sailors, the poorest peasants. TheGovernment is in your hands. You are the masters. Great Russiabelongs to you. Will you give it back?"While he spoke, he kept himself up by sheer evident effort of will,and as he went on the deep sincere feeling back of his words brokethrough the tired voice. At the end he totered, almost falling; ahundred hands reached up to help him down, and the great dim spacesof the hall gave back the surf of sound that beat upon him.Khanjunov tried to speak again, but "Vote! Vote! Vote!" they cried.At length, giving in, he read the resolution: that the _brunnoviki_withdraw their representative from the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, and declare their neutrality in the present civil war.All those in favour should go to the right; those opposed, to theleft. There was a moment of hesitation, a still expectancy, and thenthe crowd began to surge faster and faster, stumbling over oneanother, to the left, hundreds of big soldiers in a solid massrushing across the dirt floor in the faint light.... Near us aboutfifty men were left stranded, stubbornly in favour, and even as thehigh roof shook under the shock of victorious roaring, they turnedand rapidly walked out of the building-and, some of them, out of theRevolution....Imagine this struggle being repeated in every barracks of the city,the district, the whole front, all Russia. Imagine the sleeplessKrylenkos, watching the regiments, hurrying from place to place,arguing, threatening, entreating. And then imaging the same in allthe locals of every labour union, in the factories, the villages, onthe battle-ships of the far-flung Russian fleets; think of thehundreds of thousands of Russian men staring up at speakers all overthe vast country, workmen, peasants, soldiers, sailors, trying sohard to understand and to choose, thinking so intensely-and decidingso unanimously at the end. So was the Russian Revolution....Up at Smolny the new Council of People's Commissars was not idle.Already the first decree was on the presses, to be circulated inthousands through the city streets that night, and shipped in balesby every train southward and east:In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic, chosen by theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputieswith participation of peasant deputies, the Council of People'sCommissars decrees:1. The elections for the Constituent Assembly shall take place atthe date determined upon-November 12.2. All electoral commissions, organs of local self-government,Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, and soldiers'organisations on the front should make every effort to assure freeand regular elections at the date determined upon.In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic, _ThePresident of the Council of People's Commissars_,VLADIMIR ULIANOV-LENIN.In the Municipal building the Duma was in full blast. A member ofthe Council of the Republic was talking as we came in. The Council,he said, did not consider itself dissolved at all, but merely unableto continue its labours until it secured a new meeting-place. In themeanwhile, its Committee of Elders had determined to enter _enmasse_ the Committee for Salvation.... This, I may remarkparenthetically, is the last time history mentions the Council ofthe Russian Republic....Then followed the customary string of delegates from the Ministries,the _Vikzhel,_ the Union of Posts and Telegraphs, for the hundredthtime reiterating their determination not to work for the Bolshevikusurpers. A _yunker_ who had been in the Winter Palace told ahighly-coloured tale of the heroism of himself and his comrades, anddisgraceful conduct of the Red Guards-all of which was devoutlybelieved. Somebody read aloud an account in the SocialistRevolutionary paper _Narod,_ which stated that five hundred millionrubles' worth of damage had been done in the Winter Palace, anddescribing in great detail the loot and breakage.From time to time couriers came from the telephone with news. Thefour Socialist Ministers had been released from prison. Krylenko hadgone to Peter-Paul to tell Admiral Verderevsky that the Ministry ofMarine was deserted, and to beg him, for the sake of Russia, to takecharge under the authority of the Council of People's Commissars;and the old seaman had consented.... Kerensky was advancing north fromGatchina, the Bolshevik garrisons falling back before him. Smolnyhad issued another decree, enlarging the powers of the City Dumas todeal with food supplies.This last piece of insolence caused an outburst of fury. He, Lenin,the usurper, the tyrant, whose Commissars had seized the Municipalgarage, entered the Municipal ware houses, were interfering with theSupply Committees and the distribution of food-he presumed to definethe limits of power of the free, independent, autonomous CityGovernment! One member, shaking his fist, moved to cut off the foodof the city if the Bolsheviki dared to interfere with the SupplyCommittees.... Another, representative of the Special SupplyCommittee, reported that the food situation was very grave, andasked that emissaries be sent out to hasten food trains.Diedonenko announced dramatically that the garrison was wavering.The Semionovsky regiment had already decided to submit to the ordersof the Socialist Revolutionary party; the crews of the torpedo-boatson the Neva were shaky. Seven members were at once appointed tocontinue the propaganda....Then the old Mayor stepped into the tribune: "Comrades and citizens!I have just learned that the prisoners in Peter Paul are in danger.Fourteen _yunkers_ of the Pavlovsk school have been stripped andtortured by the Bolshevik guards. One has gone mad. They arethreatening to lynch the Ministers!" There was a whirlwind ofindignation and horror, which only grew more violent when a stockylittle woman dressed in grey demanded the floor, and lifted up herhard, metallic voice. This was Vera Slutskaya, veteran revolutionistand Bolshevik member of the Duma."That is a lie and a provocation!" she said, unmoved at the torrentof abuse. "The Workers' and Peasants' Government, which hasabolished the death penalty, cannot permit such deeds. We demandthat this story be investigated, at once; if there is any truth init, the Government will take energetic measures!"A commission composed of members of all parties was immediatelyappointed, and with the Mayor, sent to Peter Paul to investigate. Aswe followed them out, the Duma was appointing another commission tomeet Kerensky--to try and avoid bloodshed when he entered thecapital....It was midnight when we bluffed our past the guards at the gate ofthe fortress, and went forward under the faint glimmer of rareelectric lights along the side of the church where lie the tombs ofthe Tsars, beneath the slender golden spire and the chimes, which,for months, continued to play _Bozhe Tsaria Khrani [*]_ every day at[* "God Save the Tsar."noon.... The place was deserted; in most of the windows there were noteven lights. Occasionally we bumped into a burly figure stumblingalong in the dark, who answered questions with the usual, _"Yanieznayu."_[Graphic page-166 Pass to Reed fromDepartment of Prisons   translation follows]Pass from the Department of Prisons of the Soviet Government tovisit freely all prisons of Petrograd and Cronstadt.

No. 213Petrograd, SmolnyInstitute, room No. 56-                      PASSTo the representative of the American Socialist press, JOHN REED, tovisit all places of confinement in the cities of Petrograd andCronstadt, for the purpose of generally investigating the conditionof the prisoners, and for thorough social information for thepurpose of stopping the flood of newspaper lies against demorcracy.       Chief Commissar       SecretaryOn the left loomed the low dark outline of Trubetskoi Bastion, thatliving grave in which so many martyrs of liberty had lost theirlives or their reason in the days of the Tsar, where the ProvisionalGovernment had in turn shut up the Ministers of the Tsar, and nowthe Bolsheviki had shut up the Ministers of the ProvisionalGovernment.A friendly sailor led us to the office of the commandant, in alittle house near the Mint. Half a dozen Red Guards, sailors andsoldiers were sitting around a hot room full of smoke, in which asamovar steamed cheerfully. They welcomed us with great cordiality,offering tea. The commandant was not in; he was escorting acommission of _"sabotazhniki"_ (sabotageurs) from the City Duma, whoinsisted that the _yunkers_ were all being murdered. This seemed toamuse them very much. At one side of the room sat a bald-headed,dissipated-looking little man in a frock-coat and a rich fur coat,biting his moustache and staring around him like a cornered rat. Hehad just been arrested. Somebody said, glancing carelessly at him,that he was a Minister or something.... The little man didn't seem tohear it; he was evidently terrified, although the occupants of theroom showed no animosity whatever toward him.I went across and spoke to him in French. "Count Tolstoy," heanswered, bowing stiffly. "I do not understand why I was arrested. Iwas crossing the Troitsky Bridge on my way home when two of these-ofthese-persons held me up. I was a Commissar of the ProvisionalGovernment attached to the General Staff, but in no sense a memberof the Government...""Let him go,"said a sailor. "He's harmless....""No," responded the soldier who had brought the prisoner. "We mustask the commandant.""Oh, the commandant!" sneered the sailor. "What did you make arevolution for? To go on obeying officers?"A _praporshtchik_ of the Pavlovsky regiment was telling us how theinsurrection started. "The _polk_ (regiment) was on duty at theGeneral Staff the night of the 6th. Some of my comrades and I werestanding guard; Ivan Pavlovitch and another man-I don't remember hisname-well, they hid behind the window-curtains in the room where theStaff was having a meeting, and they heard a great many things. For   any things. For   |          |example, they heard orders to bring the Gatchina _yunkers_ toPetrograd by night, and an order for the Cossacks to be ready tomarch in the morning.... The principal points in the city were to beoccupied before dawn. Then there was the business of opening thebridges. But when they began to talk about surrounding Smolny, thenIvan Pavlovitch couldn't stand it any longer. That minute there wasa good deal of coming and going, so he slipped out and came down tothe guard-room,leaving the other comrade to pick up what he could."I was already suspicious that something was going on. Automobilesfull of officers kept coming, and all the Ministers were there. IvanPavlovitch told me what he had heard. It was half-past two in themorning. The secretary of the regimental Committee was there, so wetold him and asked what to do."'Arrest everybody coming and going!#' he says. So we began to doit. In an hour we had some officers and a couple of Ministers, whomwe sent up to Smolny right away. But the Military RevolutionaryCommittee wasn't ready; they didn't know what to do; and pretty soonback came the order to let everybody go and not arrest anybody else.Well, we ran all the way to Smolny, and I guess we talked for anhour before they finally saw that it was war. It was five o'clockwhen we got back to the Staff, and by that time most of them weregone. But we got a few, and the garrison was all on the march...."A Red Guard from Vasili Ostrov described in great detail what hadhappened in his district on the great day of the rising. "We didn'thave any machine-guns over there," he said, laughing, "and wecouldn't get any from Smolny. Comrade Zalking, who was a member ofthe _Uprava_ (Central Bureau) of the Ward Duma, remembered all atonce that there was lying in the meeting-room of the _Uprava_ amachinegun which had been captured from the Germans. So he and I andanother comrade went there. The Mensheviki and SocialistRevolutionaries were having a meeting. Well, we opened the door andwalked right in on them, as they sat around the table-twelve orfifteen of them, three of us. When they saw us they stopped talkingand just stared. We walked right across the room, uncoupled themachine-gun; Comrade Zalkind picked up one part, I the other, we putthem on our shoulders and walked out-and not a single man said aword!""Do you know how the Winter Palace was captured?" asked a third man,a sailor. "Along about eleven o'clock we found out there weren't anymore _yunkers_ on the Neva side. So we broke in the doors andfiltered up the different stairways one by one, or in littlebunches. When we got to the top of the stairs the _yunkers_ held usup and took away our guns. Still our fellows kept coming up, littleby little, until we had a majority. Then we turned around and tookaway the _yunkers'_ guns...."Just then the commandant entered-a merry-looking youngnon-commissioned officer with his arm in a sling, and deep circlesof sleeplessness under his eyes. His eye fell first on the prisoner,who at once began to explain."Oh, yes," interrupted the other. "You were one of the committee whorefused to surrender the Staff Wednesday afternoon. However, wedon't want you, citizen. Apologies-" He opened the door and wavedhis arm for Count Tolstoy to leave. Several of the others,especially the Red Guards, grumbled protests, and the sailorremarked triumphantly, _"Vot!_ There! Didn't I say so?"Two soldiers now engaged his attention. They had been elected acommittee of the fortress garrison to protest. The prisoners, theysaid, were getting the same food as the guards, when there wasn'teven enough to keep a man from being hungry. "Why should thecounter-revolutionists be treated so well?""We are revolutionists, comrades, not bandits," answered thecommandant. He turned to us. We explained that rumours were goingabout that the _yunkers_ were being tortured, and the lives of theMinisters threatened. Could we perhaps see the prisoners, so as tobe able to prove to the world-?""No," said the young soldier, irritably. "I am not going to disturbthe prisoners again. I have just been compelled to wake them up-theywere sure we were going to massacre them.... Most of the _yunkers_have been released anyway, and the rest will go out to-morrow." Heturned abruptly away."Could we talk to the Duma commission, then?"The Commandant, who was pouring himself a glass of tea, nodded."They are still out in the hall," he said carelessly.Indeed they stood there just outside the door, in the feeble lightof an oil lamp, grouped around the Mayor and talking excitedly."Mr. Mayor," I said, "we are American correspondents. Will youplease tell us officially the result of your investigations?"He turned to us his face of venerable dignity."There is no truth in the reports," he said slowly. "Except for theincidents which occurred as the Ministers were being brought here,they have been treated with every consideration. As for the_yunkers,_ not one has received the slightest injury...."Up the Nevsky, in the empty after-midnight gloom, an interminablecolumn of soldiers shuffled in silence-to battle with Kerensky. Indim back streets automobiles without lights flitted to and fro, andthere was furtive activity in Fontanka 6, headquarters of thePeasants' Soviet, in a certain apartment of a huge building on theNevsky, and in the _Injinierny Zamok_ (School of Engineers); theDuma was illuminated....In Smolny Institute the Military Revolutionary Committee flashedbaleful fire, pounding like an over-loaded dynamo....                              Chapter VII                          The Revolutionary FrontSATURDAY, November 10th....Citizens!The Military Revolutionary Committee declares that it will nottolerate any violation of revolutionary order....Theft, brigandage, assaults and attempts at massacre will beseverely punished....Following the example of the Paris Commune, the Committee willdestroy without mercy any looter or instigator of disorder....Quiet lay the city. Not a hold-up, not a robbery, not even a drunkenfight. By night armed patrols went through the silent streets, andon the corners soldiers and Red Guards squatted around little fires,laughing and singing. In the daytime great crowds gathered on thesidewalks listening to interminable hot debates between students andsoldiers, business men and workmen.Citizens stopped each other on the street."The Cossacks are coming?""No....""What's the latest?""I don't know anything. Where's Kerensky?""They say only eight versts from Petrograd.... Is it true that theBolsheviki have fled to the battleship _Avrora?"_"They say so...."Only the walls screamed, and the few newspapers; denunciation,appeal, decree....An enormous poster carried the hysterical manifesto of the ExecutiveCommittee of the Peasant' Soviets:....They (the Bolsheviki) dare to say that they are supported by theSoviets of Peasants' Deputies, and that they are speaking on behalfof the Soviets of Peasants' Deputies....Let all working-class Russia know that this is a LIE, AND THAT ALLTHE WORKING PEASANTS-in the person of-the EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THEALL-RUSSIAN SOVIETS OF PEASANTS' DEPUTIES-refutes with indignationall participation of the organised peasantry in this criminalviolation of the will of the working-classes....From the Soldier Section of the Socialist Revolutionary party:The insane attempt of the Bolsheviki is on the eve of collapse. Thegarrison is divided.... The Ministries are on strike and bread isgetting scarcer. All factions except the few Bolsheviki have leftthe Congress. The Bolsheviki are alone....We call upon all sane elements to group themselves around theCommittee for Salvation of Country and Revolution, and to preparethemselves seriously to be ready at the first call of the CentralCommittee....In a hand-bill the Council of the Republic recited its wrongs:Ceding to the force of bayonets, the Council of the Republic hasbeen obliged to separate, and temporarily to interrupt its meetings.The usurpers, with the words "Liberty and Socialism" on their lips,have set up a rule of arbitrary violence. They have arrested themembers of the Provisional Government, closed the newspapers, seizedthe printing-shops....This power must be considered the enemy of thepeople and the Revolution; it is necessary to do battle with it, andto pull it down....The Council of the Republic, until the resumption of its labours,invites the citizens of the Russian Republic to group themselvesaround the....local Committees for Salvation of Country andRevolution, which are organising the overthrow of the Bolsheviki andthe creation of a Government capable of leading the country to theConstituent Assembly._Dielo Naroda_said:A revolution is a rising of all the people.... But here what have we?Nothing but a handful of poor fools deceived by Lenin and Trotzky....Their decrees and their appeals will simply add to the museum ofhistorical curiosities....And _Narodnoye Slovo_(People'sWord-PopulistSocialist):"Workers' and Peasants' Government?" That is only a pipedream;nobody, either in Russia or in the countries of our Allies, willrecognise this "Government"-or even in the enemy countries....The bourgeois press had temporarily disappeared...._Pravada_ had anaccount of the first meeting of the new _Tsay-ee-kah,_ now theparliament of the Russian Soviet Republic. Miliutin, Commissar ofAgriculture, remarked that the Peasants' Executive Committee hadcalled an All-Russian Peasant Congress for December 13th."But we cannot wait," he said. "We must have the backing of thepeasants. I propose that _we_ call the Congress of Peasants, and doit immediately...." The Left Socialist Revolutionaries agreed. AnAppeal to the Peasants of Russia was hastily drafted, and acommittee of five elected to carry out the project.The question of detailed plans for distributing the land, and thequestion of Workers' Control of Industry, were postponed until theexperts working on them should submit a report.Three decrees (See App. VII, Sect. 1) were read and approved: first,Lenin's "General Rules For the Press," ordering the suppression ofall newspapers inciting to resistance and disobedience to the newGovernment, inciting to criminal acts, or deliberately pervertingthe news; the Decree of Moratorium for House-rents; and the DecreeEstablishing a Workers' Militia. Also orders, one giving theMunicipal Duma power to requisition empty apartments and houses, theother directing the unloading of freight cars in the railroadterminals, to hasten the distribution of necessities and to free thebadly-needed rolling-stock....Two hours later the Executive Committee of the Peasants' Soviets wassending broadcast over Russia the following telegram:The arbitrary organisation of the Bolsheviki, which is called"Bureau of Organisation for the National Congress of Peasants,"isinviting all the Peasants' Soviets to send delegates to the Congressat Petrograd....The Executive Committee of the Soviets of Peasants' Deputiesdeclares that it considers, now as well as before, that it would bedangerous to take away from the provinces at this moment the forcesnecessary to prepare for elections to the Constituent Assembly,which is the only salvation of the working-class and the country. Weconfirm the date of the Congress of Peasants, _December 13th._At the Duma all was excitement, officers coming and going, the Mayorin conference with the leaders of the Committee for Salvation. ACouncillor ran in with a copy of Kerensky's proclamation, dropped byhundreds from an aeroplane low flying down the Nevsky, whichthreatened terrible vengeance on all who did not submit, and orderedsoldiers to lay down their arms and assemble immediately in MarsField.The Minister-President had taken Tsarskoye Selo, we were told, andwas already in the Petrograd campagna, five miles away. He wouldenter the city to-morrow-in a few hours. The Soviet troops incontact with his Cossacks were said to be going over to theProvisional Government. Tchernov was somewhere in between, trying toorganise the "neutral" troops into a force to halt the civil war.In the city the garrison regiments were leaving the Bolsheviki, theysaid. Smolny was already abandoned.... All the Governmental machineryhad stopped functioning. The employees of the State Bank had refusedto work under Commissars from Smolny, refused to pay out money tothem. All the private banks were closed. The Ministries were onstrike. Even now a committee from the Duma was making the rounds ofbusiness houses, collecting a fund to pay the salaries of thestrikers....Trotzky had gone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ordered theclerks to translate the Decree on Peace into foreign languages; sixhundred functionaries had hurled their resignations in his face....Shliapnikov, Commissar of Labour, had commanded all the employees ofhis Ministry to return to their places within twenty-four hours, orlose their places and their pension-rights; only the door-servantshad responded.... Some of the branches of the Special Food SupplyCommittee had suspended work rather than submit to the Bolsheviki....In spite of lavish promises of high wages and better conditions, theoperators at the Telephone Exchange would not connect Sovietheadquarters....The Socialist Revolutionary Party had voted to expel all members whohad remained in the Congress of Soviets, and all who were takingpart in the insurrection....News from the provinces. Moghilev had declared against theBolsheviki. At Kiev the Cossacks had overthrown the Soviets andarrested all the insurrectionary leaders. The Soviet and garrison ofLuga, thirty thousand strong, affirmed its loyalty to theProvisional Government, and appealed to all Russia to rally aroundit. Kaledin had dispersed all Soviets and Unions in the Don Basin,and his forces were moving north....Said a representative of the Railway Workers: "Yesterday we sent atelegram all over Russia demanding that war between the politicalparties cease at once, and insisting on the formation of a coalitionSocialist Government. Otherwise we shall call a strike to-morrownight.... In the morning there will be a meeting of all factions toconsider the question. The Bolsheviki seem anxious for anagreement....""If they last that long!" laughed the City Engineer, a stout, ruddyman....As we came up to Smolny-not abandoned, but busier than ever, throngsof workers and soldiers running in and out, and doubled guardseverywhere-we met the reporters for the bourgeois and "moderate"Socialist papers."Threw us out!" cried one, from _Volia Naroda._ "Bonch-Bruevitchcame down to the Press Bureau and told us to leave! Said we werespies!" They all began to talk at once: "Insult! Outrage! Freedom ofthe press!"In the lobby were great tables heaped with stacks of appeals,proclamations and orders of the Military Revolutionary Committee.Workmen and soldiers staggered past, carrying them to waitingautomobiles.One began:TO THE PILLORY!In this tragic moment through which the Russian masses are living,the Mensheviki and their followers and the Right SocialistRevolutionaries have betrayed the working-class. They have enlistedon the side of Kornilov, Kerensky and Savinkov....They are printing orders of the traitor Kerensky and creating apanic in the city, spreading the most ridiculous rumours of mythicalvictories by that renegade....Citizens! Don't believe these false rumours. No power can defeat thePeople's Revolution.... Premier Kerensky and his followers awaitspeedy and well-deserved punishment....We are putting them in the Pillory. We are abandoning them to theenmity of all workers, soldiers, sailors and peasants, on whom theyare trying to rivet the ancient chains. They will never be able towash from their bodies the stain of the people's hatred and contempt.Shame and curses to the traitors of the People!...The Military Revolutionary Committee had moved into larger quarters,room 17 on the top floor. Red Guards were at the door. Inside, thenarrow space in front of the railing was crowded with well-dressedpersons, outwardly respectful but inwardly full of murder-bourgeoiswho wanted permits for their automobiles, or passports to leave thecity, among them many foreigners.... Bill Shatov and Peters were onduty. They suspended all other business to read us the latestbulletins.The One Hundred Seventy-ninth Reserve Regiment offers its unanimoussupport. Five thousand stevedores at the Putilov wharves greet thenew Government. Central Committee of the Trade Unions-enthusiasticsupport. The garrison and squadron at Reval elect MilitaryRevolutionary Committees to cooperate, and despatch troops. MilitaryRevolutionary Committees control in Pskov and Minsk. Greetings fromthe Soviets of Tsaritzin, Rovensky-on-Don, Tchernogorsk,Sevastopol.... The Finland Division, the new Committees of the Fifthand Twelfth Armies, offer allegiance....From Moscow the news is uncertain. Troops of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee occupy the strategic points of the city; twocompanies on duty in the Kremlin have gone over to the Soviets, butthe Arsenal is in the hands of Colonel Diabtsev and his _yunkers._The Revolutionary Committee demanded arms for the workers, andRiabtsev parleyed with them until this morning, when suddenly hesent an ultimatum to the Committee, ordering Soviet troops tosurrender and the Committee to disband. Fighting has begun....In Petrograd the Staff submitted to Smolny's Commissars at once. The_Tsentroflot,_ refusing, was stormed by Dybenko and a company ofCronstadt sailors, and a new _Tsentroflot_ set up, supported by theBaltic and the Black Sea battleships....But beneath all the breezy assurance there was a chill premonition,a feeling of uneasiness in the air. Kerensky's Cossacks were comingfast; they had artillery. Skripnik, Secretary of the Factory-ShopCommittees, his face drawn and yellow, assured me that there was awhole army corps of them, but he added, fiercely, "They'll nevertake us alive!" Petrovsky laughed weariedly, "To-morrow maybe we'llget a sleep-a long one...." Lozovsky, with his emaciated, red-beardedface, said, "What chance have we? All alone.... A mob against trainedsoldiers!"South and south-west the Soviets had fled before Kerensky, and thegarrisons of Gatchina, Pavlovsk, Tsarskoye Selo were divided-halfvoting to remain neutral, the rest, without officers, falling backon the capital in the wildest disorder.In the halls they were pasting up bulletins:FROM KRASNOYE SELO, NOVEMBER 10TH, 8 A.M._To be communicated to all Commanders of Staffs, Commanders inChief, Commanders, everywhere and to all, all, all._The ex-Minister Kerensky has sent a deliberately false telegram toevery one everywhere to the effect that the troops of revolutionaryPetrograd have voluntarily surrendered their arms and joined thearmies of the former Government, the Government of Treason, and thatthe soldiers have been ordered by the Military RevolutionaryCommittee to retreat. The troops of a free people do not retreat nordo they surrender.Our troops have left Gatchina in order to avoid bloodshed betweenthemselves and their mistaken brother-Cossacks, and in order to takea more convenient position, which is at present so strong that ifKerensky and his companions in arms should even increase theirforces ten times, still there would be no cause for anxiety. Thespirit of our troops is excellent.In Petrograd all is quiet._Chief of the Defence of Petrograd and the Petrograd District,_Lieutenant-Colonel Muraviov.As we left the Military Revolutionary Committee Antonov entered, apaper in his hand, looking like a corpse."Send this," said he.TO ALL DISTRICT SOVIETS OF WORKERS' DEPUTIES AND FACTORYSHOPCOMMITTEESThe Kornilovist bands of Kerensky are threatening the approaches tothe capital. All the necessary orders have been given to crushmercilessly the counter-revolutionary attempt against the people andits conquests.The Army and the Red Guard of the Revolution are in need of theimmediate support of the workers.WE ORDER THE WARD SOVIETS AND FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES:1. To move out the greatest possible number of workers for thedigging of trenches, the erection of barricades and reinforcing ofwire entanglements.2. Wherever it shall be necessary for this purpose to stop work atthe factories this shall be done immediately.3. All common and barbed wire available must be assembled, and alsoall implements for the digging of trenches and the erection ofbarricades.4. All available arms must be taken.5. THE STRICTEST DISCIPLINE IS TO BE OBSERVED, AND EVERY ONE MUST BEREADY TO SUPPORT THE ARMY OF THE REVOLUTION BY ALL MEANS._Chairman of the Petrograd Soviet of Worker's and Soldiers'Deputies,_People's Commissar LEON TROTZKY._Chairman of the Military Revolutionary Committee,_Commander in Chief PODVOISKY.As we came out into the dark and gloomy day all around the greyhorizon factory whistles were blowing, a hoarse and nervous sound,full of foreboding. By tens of thousands the working-people pouredout, men and women; by tens of thousands the humming slums belchedout their dun and miserable hordes. Red Petrograd was in danger!Cossacks! South and southwest they poured through the shabby streetstoward the Moskovsky Gate, men, women and children, with rifles,picks, spades, rolls of wire, cartridge-belts over their workingclothes.... Such an immense, spontaneous outpouring of a city neverwas seen! They rolled along torrent-like, companies of soldiersborne with them, guns, motor-trucks, wagons-the revolutionaryproletariat defending with its breast the capital of the Workers'and Peasants' Republic!Before the door of Smolny was an automobile. A slight man with thickglasses magnifying his red-rimmed eyes, his speech a painful effort,stood leaning against a mud-guard with his hands in the pockets of ashabby raglan. A great bearded sailor, with the clear eyes of youth,prowled restlessly about, absently toying with an enormousblue-steel revolver, which never left his hand. These were Antonovand Dybenko.Some soldiers were trying to fasten two military bicycles on therunning-board. The chauffeur violently protested; the enamel wouldget scratched, he said. True, he was a Bolshevik, and the automobilewas commandeered from a bourgeois; true, the bicycles were for theuse of orderlies. But the chauffeur's professional pride wasrevolted.... So the bicycles were abandoned....The People's Commissars for War and Marine were going to inspect therevolutionary front-wherever that was. Could we go with them?Certainly not. The automobile only held five-the two Commissars, twoorderlies and the chauffeur. However, a Russian acquaintance ofmine, whom I will call Trusishka, calmly got in and sat down, norcould any argument dislodge him....I see no reason to doubt Trusishka's story of the journey. As theywent down the Suvorovsky Prospect some one mentioned food. Theymight be out three or four days, in a country indifferently wellprovisioned. They stopped the car. Money? The Commissar of Warlooked through his pockets-he hadn't a kopek. The Commissar ofMarine was broke. So was the chauffeur. Trusishka bought theprovisions....Just as they turned into the Nevsky a tire blew out."What shall we do?" asked Antonov."Commandeer another machine!" suggested Dybenko, waving hisrevolver. Antonov stood in the middle of the street and signalled apassing machine, driven by a soldier."I want that machine," said Antonov."You won't get it," responded the soldier."Do you know who I am?" Antonov produced a paper upon which waswritten that he had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of all thearmies of the Russian Republic, and that every one should obey himwithout question."I don't care if you're the devil himself," said the soldier, hotly."This machine belongs to the First Machine-Gun Regiment, and we'recarrying ammunition in it, and you can't have it...."The difficulty, however, was solved by the appearance of an oldbattered taxi-cab, flying the Italian flag. (In time of troubleprivate cars were registered in the name of foreign consulates, soas to be safe from requisition.) From the interior of this wasdislodged a fat citizen in an expensive fur coat, and the partycontinued on its way.Arrived at Narvskaya Zastava, about ten miles out, Antonov calledfor the commandant of the Red Guard. He was led to the edge of thetown, where some few hundred workmen had dug trenches and werewaiting for the Cossacks."Everything all right here, comrade?" asked Antonov."Everything perfect, comrade," answered the commandant."The troops are in excellent spirits.... Only one thing-we have noammunition....""In Smolny there are two billion rounds," Antonov told him. "I willgive you an order." He felt in his pockets. "Has any one a piece ofpaper?"Dybenko had none-nor the couriers. Trusishka had to offer hisnote-book...."Devil! I have no pencil!" cried Antonov. "Who's got a pencil?"Needless to say, Trusishka had the only pencil in the crowd....We who were left behind made for the Tsarskoye Selo station. Up theNevsky, as we passed, Red Guards were marching, all armed, some withbayonets and some without. The early twilight of winter was falling.Heads up they tramped in the chill mud, irregular lines of four,without music, without drums. A red flag crudely lettered in gold,"Peace! Land!" floated over them. They were very young. Theexpression on their faces was that of who know they are going todie.... Half-fearful, half-contemptuous, the crowds on the sidewalkwatched them pass, in hateful silence....[Graphic page-184  Pass to the Northern Front]This pass was issued upon the recommendation of Trotzky three daysafter the Bolshevik Revolution. It gives me the right of free travelto the Northern front-and an added note on the back extends thepermission to all fronts. It will be noticed that the speaks of the_Petersburg_, instead of the _Petrograd_ Soviet; it was the fashionamong thorough-going internationalists to abolish all names whichsmacked of "patriotism"; but at the same time, it would not do torestore the "Saint."...                      (Translation)Executive CommitteePetrograd Soviet ofWorkers' and Soldiers'     Deputies  Military Section28th October, 1917    No. 1435                      CERTIFICATEThe present certificate is given to the representative of theAmerican Social Democracy, the internationalist comrade JOHN REED.The Military Revolutionary Committee of the Petersburg Soviet ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies gives him the right of free travelthrough the entire Northern front, for the purpose of reporting toour American comrades-internationalists concerning events in Russia.                              For the President                              For the SecretaryAt the railroad station nobody knew just where Kerensky was, orwhere the front lay. Trains went no further, however, thanTsarskoye....Our car was full of commuters and country people going home, ladenwith bundles and evening papers. The talk was all of the Bolshevikrising. Outside of that, however, one would never have realised thatcivil war was rending mighty Russia in two, and that the train washeaded into the zone of battle. Through the window we could see, inthe swiftly-deepening darkness, masses of soldiers going along themuddy road toward the city, flinging out their arms in argument. Afreight-train, swarming with troops and lit up by huge bonfires, washalted on a siding. That was all. Back along the flat horizon theglow of the city's lights faded down the night. A street-car crawleddistantly along a far-flung suburb....Tsarskoye Selo-station was quiet, but knots of soldiers stood hereand there talking in low tones and looking uneasily down the emptytrack in the direction of Gatchina. I asked some of them which sidethey were on. "Well," said one, "we don't exactly know the rights ofthe matter.... There is no doubt that Kerensky is a provocator, but wedo not consider it right for Russian men to be shooting Russian men."In the station commandant's office was a big, jovial, bearded commonsoldier, wearing the red arm-band of a regimental committee. Ourcredentials from Smolny commanded immediate respect. He was plainlyfor the Soviets, but bewildered."The Red Guards were here two hours ago, but they went away again. ACommissar came this morning, but he returned to Petrograd when theCossacks arrived.""The Cossacks are here then?"He nodded, gloomily. "There has been a battle. The Cossacks cameearly in the morning. They captured two or three hundred of our men,and killed about twenty-five.""Where are the Cossacks?""Well, they didn't get this far. I don't know just where they are.Off that way...." He waved his arm vaguely westward.We had dinner-an excellent dinner, better and cheaper than could begot in Petrograd-in the station restaurant. Nearby sat a Frenchofficer who had just come on foot from Gatchina. All was quietthere, he said. Kerensky held the town. "Ah, these Russians," hewent on, "they are original! What a civil war! Everything except thefighting!"We sallied out into the town. Just at the door of the station stoodtwo soldiers with rifles and bayonets fixed. They were surrounded byabout a hundred business men, Government officials and students, whoattacked them with passionate argument and epithet. The soldierswere uncomfortable and hurt, like children unjustly scolded.A tall young man with a supercilious expression, dressed in theuniform of a student, was leading the attack."You realise, I presume," he said insolently, "that by taking uparms against your brothers you are making your-selves the tools ofmurderers and traitors?""Now brother,"answered the soldier earnestly, "you don't understand.There are two classes, don't you see, the proletariat and thebourgeoisie. We--""Oh, I know that silly talk!" broke in the student rudely. "A bunchof ignorant peasants like you hear somebody bawling a fewcatch-words. You don't understand what they mean. You just echo themlike a lot of parrots." The crowd laughed. "I'm a Marxian student.And I tell you that this isn't Socialism you are fighting for. It'sjust plain pro-German anarchy!""Oh, yes, I know," answered the soldier, with sweat dripping fromhis brow. "You are an educated man, that is easy to see, and I amonly a simple man. But it seems to me--""I suppose," interrupted the other contemptuously, "that you believeLenin is a real friend of the proletariat?""Yes, I do," answered the soldier, suffering."Well, my friend, do you know that Lenin was sent through Germany ina closed car? Do you know that Lenin took money from the Germans?""Well, I don't know much about that," answered the soldierstubbornly, "but it seems to me that what he says is what I want tohear, and all the simple men like me. Now there are two classes, thebourgeoisie and the proletariat--""You are a fool! Why, my friend, I spent two years in Schlüsselburgfor revolutionary activity, when you were still shooting downrevolutionists and singing 'God Save the Tsar!' My name is VasiliGeorgevitch Panyin. Didn't you ever hear of me?""I'm sorry to say I never did," answered the soldier with humility."But then, I am not an educated man. You are probably a great hero.""I am," said the student with conviction. "And I am opposed to theBolsheviki, who are destroying our Russia, our free Revolution. Nowhow do you account for that?"The soldier scratched his head. "I can't account for it at all," hesaid, grimacing with the pain of his intellectual processes. "To meit seems perfectly simple-but then, I'm not well educated. It seemslike there are only two classes, the proletariat and thebourgeoisie--""There you go again with your silly formula!" cried the student."--only two classes," went on the soldier, doggedly.ldquo;And whoever isn't on one side is on the other..."We wandered on up the street, where the lights were few and farbetween, and where people rarely passed. A threatening silence hungover the place-as of a sort of purgatory between heaven and hell, apolitical No Man's Land. Only the barber shops were all brilliantlylighted and crowded, and a line formed at the doors of the publicbath; for it was Saturday night, when all Russia bathes and perfumesitself. I haven't the slightest doubt that Soviet troops andCossacks mingled in the places where these ceremonies were performed.The nearer we came to the Imperial Park, the more deserted were thestreets. A frightened priest pointed out the headquarters of theSoviet, and hurried on. It was in the wing of one of the Grand Ducalpalaces, fronting the Park. The windows were dark, the door locked.A soldier, lounging about with his hands in the top of his trousers,looked us up and down with gloomy suspicion. "The Soviet went awaytwo days ago," said he. "Where?" A shrug. _"Nie znayu._ I don'tknow."A little further along was a large building, brightly illuminated.From within came a sound of hammering. While we were hesitating, asoldier and a sailor came down the street, hand in hand. I showedthem my pass from Smolny. "Are you for the Soviets?" I asked. Theydid not answer, but looked at each other in a frightened way."What is going on in there?" asked the sailor, pointing to thebuilding."I don't know."Timidly the soldier put out his hand and opened the door a crack.Inside a great hall hung with bunting and evergreens, rows ofchairs, a stage being built.A stout woman with a hammer in her hand and her mouth full of tackscame out. "What do you want?" she asked."Is there a performance to-night?" said the sailor, nervously."There will be private theatricals Sunday night," she answeredseverely. "Go away."We tried to engage the soldier and sailor in conversation, but theyseemed frightened and unhappy, and drew off into the darkness.We strolled toward the Imperial Palaces, along the edge of the vast,dark gardens, their fantastic pavilions and ornamental bridgeslooming uncertainly in the night, and soft water splashing from thefountains. At one place, where a ridiculous iron swan spatunceasingly from an artificial grotto, we were suddenly aware ofobservation, and looked up to encounter the sullen, suspicious gazeof half a dozen gigantic armed soldiers, who stared moodily downfrom a grassy terrace. I climbed up to them. "Who are you?" I asked."We are the guard," answered one. They all looked very depressed, asundoubtedly they were, from weeks and weeks of all-day all-nightargument and debate."Are you Kerensky's troops, or the Soviets'?"There was silence for a moment, as they looked uneasily at eachother. Then, "We are neutral," said he.We went on through the arch of the huge Ekaterina Palace, into thePalace enclosure itself, asking for headquarters. A sentry outside adoor in a curving white wing of the Palace said that the commandantwas inside.In a graceful, white, Georgian room, divided into unequal parts by atwo-sided fire-place, a group of officers stood anxiously talking.They were pale and distracted, and evidently hadn't slept. To one,an oldish man with a white beard, his uniform studded withdecorations, who was pointed out as the Colonel, we showed ourBolshevik papers.He seemed surprised. "How did you get here without being killed?" heasked politely. "It is very dangerous in the streets just now.Political passion is running very high in Tsarskoye Selo. There wasa battle this morning, and there will be another to-morrow morning.Kerensky is to enter the town at eight o'clock.""Where are the Cossacks?""About a mile over that way." He waved his arm."And you will defend the city against them?""Oh dear no." He smiled. "We are holding the city for Kerensky." Ourhearts sank, for our passes stated that we were revolutionary to thecore. The Colonel cleared his throat. "About those passes of yours,"he went on. "Your lives will be in danger if you are captured.Therefore, if you want to see the battle, I will give you an orderfor rooms in the officers' hotel, and if you will come back here atseven o'clock in the morning, I will give you new passes.""So you are for Kerensky?" we said."Well, not exactly _for_ Kerensky." The Colonel hesitated. "You see,most of the soldiers in the garrison are Bolsheviki, and to-day,after the battle, they all went away in the direction of Petrograd,taking the artillery with them. You might say that none of the_soldiers_ are for Kerensky; but some of them just don't want tofight at all. The _officers_ have almost all gone over to Kerensky'sforces, or simply gone away. We are-ahem-in a most difficultposition, as you see...."We did not believe that there would be any battle.... The Colonelcourteously sent his orderly to escort us to the railroad station.He was from the South, born of French immigrant parents inBessarabia. "Ah," he kept saying, "it is not the danger or thehardships I mind, but being so long, three years, away from mymother...."Looking out of the window of the train as we sped through the colddark toward Petrograd, I caught glimpses of clumps of soldiersgesticulating in the light of fires, and of clusters of armouredcars halted together at cross-roads, the chauffeurs hanging out ofthe turrets and shouting to each other....All the troubled night over the bleakflats leaderless bands ofsoldiers and Red Guards wandered, clashing and confused, and theCommissars of the Military Revolutionary Committee hurried from onegroup to another, trying to organise a defence....Back in town excited throngs were moving in tides up and down theNevsky. Something was in the air. From the Warsaw Railway stationcould be heard far-off cannonade. In the _yunker_ schools there wasfeverish activity. Duma members went from barracks to barracks,arguing and pleading, narrating fearful stories of Bolshevikviolence-massacre of the _yunkers_ in the Winter Palace, rape of thewomen soldiers, the shooting of the girl before the Duma, the murderof Prince Tumanov.... In the Alexander Hall of the Duma building theCommittee for Salvation was in special session; Commissars came andwent, running.... All the journalists expelled from Smolny were there,in high spirits. They did not believe our report of conditions inTsarskoye. Why, everybody knew that Tsarskoye was in Kerensky'shands, and that the Cossacks were now at Pulkovo. A committee wasbeing elected to meet Kerensky at the railway station in themorning....One confided to me, in strictest secrecy, that thecounter-revolution would begin at midnight. He showed me twoproclamations, one signed by Gotz and Polkovnikov, ordering the_yunker_ schools, soldier convalescents in the hospitals, and theKnights of St. George to mobilise on a war footing and wait fororders from the Committee for Salvation; the other from theCommittee for Salvation itself, which read as follows:To the Population of Petrograd!Comrades, workers, soldiers and citizens of revolutionary Petrograd!  nary Petrograd!  |          |The Bolsheviki, while appealing for peace at the front, are incitingto civil war in the rear.Do not dig their provocatory appeals!Do not dig trenches!Down with the traitorous barricades!Lay down your arms!Soldiers, return to your barracks!The war begun in Petrograd-is the death of the Revolution!In the name of liberty, land, and peace, unite around the Committeefor Salvation of Country and Revolution!As we left the Duma a company of Red Guards, stern-faced anddesperate, came marching down the dark, deserted street with a dozenprisoners-members of the local branch of the Council of Cossacks,caught red-handed plotting counter-revolution in their headquarters....A soldier, accompanied by a small boy with a pail of paste, wassticking up great flaring notices:By virtue of the present, the city of Petrograd and its suburbs aredeclared in a state of siege. All assemblies or meetings in thestreets, and generally in the open air, are forbidden until furtherorders.N. PODVOISKY, President of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee.As we went home the air was full of confused sound-automobile horns,shouts, distant shots. The city stirred uneasily, wakeful.In the small hours of the morning a company of _yunkers,_ disguisedas soldiers of the Semionovsky Regiment, presented themselves at theTelephone Exchange just before the hour of changing guard. They hadthe Bolshevik password, and took charge without arousing suspicion.A few minutes later Antonov appeared, making a round of inspection.Him they captured and locked in a small room. When the relief cameit was met by a blast of rifle-fire, several being killed.Counter-revolution had begun...                              Chapter VIII                            Counter-RevolutionNEXT morning, Sunday the 11th, the Cossacks entered Tsarskoye Selo,Kerensky (See App. VIII, Sect. 1) himself riding a white horse andall the church-bells clamouring. From the top of a little hilloutside the town could be seen the golden spires and many-colouredcupolas, the sprawling grey immensity of the capital spread alongthe dreary plain, and beyond, the steely Gulf of Finland.There was no battle. But Kerensky made a fatal blunder. At seven inthe morning he sent word to the Second Tsarskoye Selo Rifles to laydown their arms. The soldiers replied that they would remainneutral, but would not disarm. Kerensky gave them ten minutes inwhich to obey. This angered the soldiers; for eight months they hadbeen governing themselves by committee, and this smacked of the oldrégime.... A few minutes later Cossack artillery opened fire on thebarracks, killing eight men. From that moment there were no more"neutral" soldiers in Tsarskoye....Petrograd woke to bursts of rifle-fire, and the tramping thunder ofmen marching. Under the high dark sky a cold wind smelt of snow. Atdawn the Military Hotel and the Telegraph Agency had been taken bylarge forces of _yunkers,_ and bloodily recaptured. The TelephoneStation was besieged by sailors, who lay behind barricades ofbarrels, boxes and tin sheets in the middle of the Morskaya, orsheltered themselves at the corner of the Gorokhovaya and of St.Isaac's Square, shooting at anything that moved. Occasionally anautomobile passed in and out, flying the Red Cross flag. The sailorslet it pass....Albert Rhys Williams was in the Telephone Exchange. He went out withthe Red Cross automobile, which was ostensibly full of wounded.After circulating about the city, the car went by devious ways tothe Mikhailovsky _yunker_ school, headquarters of thecounter-revolution. A French officer, in the court-yard, seemed tobe in command.... By this means ammunition and supplies were conveyedto the Telephone Exchange. Scores of these pretended ambulancesacted as couriers and ammunition trains for the _yunkers._Five or six armoured cars, belonging to the disbanded BritishArmoured Car Division, were in their hands. As Louise Bryant wasgoing along St. Isaac's Square one came rolling up from theAdmiralty, on its way to the Telephone Exchange. At the corner ofthe Gogolia, right in front of her, the engine stalled. Some sailorsambushed behind wood-piles began shooting. The machine-gun in theturret of the thing slewed around and spat a hail of bulletsindiscriminately into the wood-piles and the crowd. In the archwaywhere Miss Bryant stood seven people were shot dead, among them twolittle boys. Suddenly, with a shout, the sailors leaped up andrushed into the flaming open; closing around the monster, theythrust their bayonets into the loop-holes, again and again, yelling...The chauffeur pretended to be wounded, and they let him go free-torun to the Duma and swell the tale of Bolshevik atrocities....Amongthe dead was a British Officer....Later the newspapers told of another French officer, captured in a_yunker_ armoured car and sent to Peter-Paul. The French Embassypromptly denied this, but one of the City Councillors told me thathe himself had procured the officer's release from prison....Whatever the official attitude of the Allied Embassies, individualFrench and British officers were active these days, even to theextent of giving advice at executive sessions of the Committee forSalvation.All day long in every quarter of the city there were skirmishesbetween _yunkers_ and Red Guards, battles between armoured cars....Volleys, single shots and the shrill chatter of machine-guns couldbe heard, far and near. The iron shutters of the shops were drawn,but business still went on. Even the moving-picture shows, alloutside lights dark, played to crowded houses. The street-cars ran.The telephones were all working; when you called Central, shootingcould be plainly heard over the wire.... Smolny was cut off, but theDuma and the Committee for Salvation were in constant communicationwith all the _yunker_ schools and with Kerensky at Tsarskoye.At seven in the morning the Vladimir _yunker_ school was visited bya patrol of soldiers, sailors and Red Guards, who gave the _yunkers_twenty minutes to lay down their arms. The ultimatum was rejected.An hour later the _yunkers_ got ready to march, but were driven backby a violent fusillade from the corner of the Grebetskaya and theBolshoy Prospekt. Soviet troops surrounded the building and openedfire, two armoured cars cruising back and forth with machine gunsraking it. The _yunkers_ telephoned for help. The Cossacks repliedthat they dare not come, because a large body of sailors with twocannon commanded their barracks. The Pavlovsk school was surrounded.Most of the Mikhailov _yunkers_ were fighting in the streets....At half-past eleven three field-pieces arrived. Another demand tosurrender was met by the _yunkers_ shooting down two of the Sovietdelegates under the white flag. Now began a real bombardment. Greatholes were torn in the walls of the school. The _yunkers_ defendedthemselves desperately; shouting waves of Red Guards, assaulting,crumpled under the withering blast.... Kerensky telephoned fromTsarskoye to refuse all parley with the Military RevolutionaryCommittee.Frenzied by defeat and their heaps of dead, the Soviet troops openeda tornado of steel and flame against the battered building. Theirown officers could not stop the terrible bombardment. A Commissarfrom Smolny named Kirilov tried to halt it; he was threatened withlynching. The Red Guards' blood was up.At half-past two the _yunkers_ hoisted a white flag; they wouldsurrender if they were guaranteed protection. This was promised.With a rush and a shout thousands of soldiers and Red Guards pouredthrough windows, doors and holes in the wall. Before it could bestopped five _yunkers_ were beaten and stabbed to death. The rest,about two hundred, were taken to Peter-Paul under escort, in smallgroups so as to avoid notice. On the way a mob set upon one party,killing eight more _yunkers_.... More than a hundred Red Guards andsoldiers had fallen....Two hours later the Duma got a telephone message that the victorswere marching toward the _Injinierny Zamok_-the Engineers' school. Adozen members immediately set out to distribute among them armfulsof the latest proclamation of the Committee for Salvation. Severaldid not come back.... All the other schools surrendered withoutresistance, and the _yunkers_ were sent unharmed to Peter-Paul andCronstadt....The Telephone Exchange held out until afternoon, when a Bolshevikarmoured car appeared, and the sailors stormed the place. Shrieking,the frightened telephone girls ran to and fro; the _yunkers_ torefrom their uniforms all distinguishing marks, and one offeredWilliams _anything_ for the loan of his overcoat, as a disguise...."They will massacre us! They will massacre us!" they cried, for manyof them had given their word at the Winter Palace not to take uparms against the People. Williams offered to mediate if Antonov werereleased. This was immediately done; Antonov and Williams madespeeches to the victorious sailors, inflamed by their many dead-andonce more the _yunkers_ went free.... All but a few, who in theirpanic tried to flee over the roofs, or to hide in the attic, andwere found and hurled into the street.Tired, bloody, triumphant, the sailors and workers swarmed into theswitchboard room, and finding so many pretty girls, fell back in anembarrassed way and fumbled with awkward feet. Not a girl wasinjured, not one insulted. Frightened, they huddled in the corners,and then, finding themselves safe, gave vent to their spite. "Ugh!The dirty, ignorant people! The fools!"... The sailors and Red Guardswere embarrassed. "Brutes! Pigs!" shrilled the girls, indignantlyputting on their coats and hats. Romantic had been their experiencepassing up cartridges and dressing the wounds of their dashing youngdefenders, the _yunkers,_ many of them members of noble families,fighting to restore their beloved Tsar! These were just commonworkmen, peasants, "Dark People."...The Commissar of the Military Revolutionary Committee, littleVishniak, tried to persuade the girls to remain. He was effusivelypolite. "You have been badly treated," he said. "The telephonesystem is controlled by the Municipal Duma. You are paid sixtyrubles a month, and have to work ten hours and more.... From now onall that will be changed. The Government intends to put thetelephones under control of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs.Your wages will be immediately raised to one hundred and fiftyrubles, and your working-hours reduced. As members of theworking-class you should be happy--"Members of the _working-class_ indeed! Did he mean to infer thatthere was anything in common between these-these animals-and _us?_Remain? Not if they offered a thousand rubles!... Haughty and spitefulthe girls left the place....The employees of the building, the line-men and labourers-theystayed. But the switch-boards must be operated-the telephone wasvital.... Only half a dozen trained operators were available.Volunteers were called for; a hundred responded, sailors, soldiers,workers. The six girls scurried backward and forward, instructing,helping, scolding.... So, crippled, halting, but _going,_ the wiresslowly began to hum. The first thing was to connect Smolny with thebarracks and the factories; the second, to cut off the Duma and the_yunker_ schools.... Late in the afternoon word of it spread throughthe city, and hundreds of bourgeois called up to scream, "Fools!Devils! How long do you think you will last? Wait till the Cossackscome!"Dusk was already falling. On the almost deserted Nevsky, swept by abitter wind, a crowd had gathered before the Kazan Cathedral,continuing the endless debate; a few workmen, some soldiers and therest shop-keepers, clerks and the like."But Lenin won't get Germany to make peace!" cried one.A violent young soldier replied. "And whose fault is it? Your damnKerensky, dirty bourgeois! To hell with Kerensky! We don't want him!We want Lenin...."Outside the Duma an officer with a white arm-band was tearing downposters from the wall, swearing loudly. One read:To the Population of Petrograd!At this dangerous hour, when the Municipal Duma ought to use everymeans to calm the population, to assure it bread and othernecessities, the Right Socialist Revolutionaries and the Cadets,forgetting their duty, have turned the Duma into acounter-revolutionary meeting, trying to raise part of thepopulation against the rest, so as to facilitate the victory ofKornilov-Kerensky. Instead of doing their duty, the Right SocialistRevolutionaries and the Cadets have transformed the Duma into anarena of political attack upon the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers'and Peasants' Deputies, against the revolutionary Government ofpeace, bread and liberty.Citizens of Petrograd, we, the Bolshevik Municipal Councillorselected by you-we want you to know that the Right SocialistRevolutionaries and the Cadets are engaged in counter-revolutionaryaction, have forgotten their duty, and are leading the population tofamine, to civil war. We, elected by 183,000 votes, consider it ourduty to bring to the attention of our constituents what is going onin the Duma, and declare that we disclaim all responsibility for theterrible but inevitable consequences....Far away still sounded occasional shots, but the city lay quiet,cold, as if exhausted by the violent spasms which had torn it.In the Nicolai Hall the Duma session was coming to an end. Even thetruculent Duma seemed a little stunned. One after another theCommissars reported-capture of the Telephone Exchange,street-fighting, the taking of the Vladimir school.... "The Duma,"said Trupp, "is on the side of the democracy in its struggle againstarbitrary violence; but in any case, whichever side wins, the Dumawill always be against lynchings and torture...."Konovski, Cadet, a tall old man with a cruel face: "When the troopsof the legal Government arrive in Petrograd, they will shoot downthese insurgents, and that will not be lynching!" Protests all overthe hall, even from his own party.Here there was doubt and depression. The counter-revolution wasbeing put down. The Central Committee of the Socialist Revolutionaryparty had voted lack of confidence in its officers; the left wingwas in control; Avksentiev had resigned. signed. A courier reportedthat the Committee of Welcome sent to meet Kerensky at the railwaystation had been arrested. In the streets could be heard the dullrumble of distant cannonading, south and southwest. Still Kerenskydid not come...Only three newspapers were out-_Pravda, Dielo Naroda_ and _NovayaZhizn._ All of them devoted much space to the new "coalition"Government. The Socialist Revolutionary paper demanded a Cabinetwithout either Cadets or Bolsheviki. Gorky was hopeful; Smolny hadmade concessions. A purely Socialist Government was taking shape-allelements except the bourgeoisie. As for _Pravda,_ it sneered:We ridicule these coalitions with political parties whose mostprominent members are petty journalists of doubtful reputation; our"coalition" is that of the proletariat and the revolutionary Armywith the poor peasants...On the walls a vainglorious announcement of the _Vikzhel,_threatening to strike if both sides did not compromise:The conquerors of these riots, the saviours of the wreck of ourcountry, these will be neither the Bolsheviki, nor the Committee forSalvation, nor the troops of Kerensky-but we, the Union ofRailwaymen...Red Guards are incapable of handling a complicated business like therailways; as for the Provisional Government, it has shown itselfincapable of holding the power...We refuse to lend our services to any party which does not act byauthority of ... a Government based on the confidence of all thedemocracy....Smolny thrilled with the boundless vitality of inexhaustiblehumanity in action.In Trade Union headquarters Lozovsky introduced me to a delegate ofthe Railway Workers of the Nicolai line, who said that the men wereholding huge mass-meetings, condemning the action of their leaders."All power to the Soviets!" he cried, pounding on the table."The_oborontsi_ in the Central Committee are playingKo&rgrave;nilov's game. They tried to send a mission to the Stavka,but we arrested them at Minsk.... Our branch has demanded anAll-Russian Convention, and they refuse to call it...."The same situation as in the Soviets, the Army Committees. One afteranother the various democratic organisations, all over Russia, werecracking and changing. The Cooperatives were torn by internalstruggles; the meetings of the Peasants' Executive broke up instormy wrangling; even among the Cossacks there was trouble....On the top floor the Military Revolutionary Committee was in fullblast, striking and slacking not. Men went in, fresh and vigorous;night and day and night and day they threw themselves into theterrible machine; and came out limp, blind with fatigue, hoarse andfilthy, to fall on the floor and sleep.... The Committee for Salvationhad been outlawed. Great piles of new proclamations (See App. VIII,Sect. 2) littered the floor:... The conspirators, who have no support among the garrison or theworking-class, above all counted on the suddenness of their attack.Their plan was discovered in time by Sub-Lieutenant Blagonravov,thanks to the revolutionary vigilance of a soldier of the Red Guard,whose name shall be made public. At the centre of the plot was theCommittee for Salvation. Colonel Polkovnikov was in command of theirforces, and the orders were signed by Gotz, former member of theProvisional Government, allowed at liberty on his word of honour....Bringing these facts to the attention of the Petrograd population,the Military Revolutionary Committee orders the arrest of allconcerned in the conspiracy, who shall be tried before theRevolutionary Tribunal....From Moscow, word that the _yunkers_ and Cossacks had surrounded theKremlin and ordered the Soviet troops to lay down their arms. TheSoviet forces complied, and as they were leaving the Kremlin, wereset upon and shot down. Small forces of Bolsheviki had been drivenfrom the Telephone and Telegraph offices; the _yunkers_ now held thecentre of the city. ... But all around them the Soviet troops weremustering. Street-fighting was slowly gathering way; all attempts atcompromise had failed.... On the side of the Soviet, ten thousandgarrison soldiers and a few Red Guards; on the side of theGovernment, six thousand _yunkers,_ twenty-five hundred Cossacks andtwo thousand White Guards.The Petrograd Soviet was meeting, and next door the new_Tsay-ee-kah,_ acting on the decrees and orders (See App. VIII,Sect. 3) which came down in a steady stream from the Council ofPeople's Commissars in session upstairs; on the Order in Which LawsAre to be Ratified and Published, Establishing an Eight hour Daysfor Workers, and Lunatcharsky's "Basis for a System of PopularEducation." Only a few hundred people were present at the twomeetings, most of them armed. Smolny was almost deserted, except forthe guards, who were busy at the hall windows, setting upmachine-guns to command the flanks of the building.In the _Tsay-ee-kah_ a delegate of the _Vikzhel_ was speaking: "Werefuse to transport the troops of either party.... We have sent acommittee to Kerensky to say that if he continues to march onPetrograd we will break his lines of communication...."He made the usual plea for a conference of all the Socialist partiesto form a new Government....Kameniev answered discreetly. The Bolsheviki would be very glad toattend the conference. The centre of gravity, however, lay not incomposition of such a Government, but in its acceptance of theprogramme of the Congress of Soviets.... The _Tsay-ee-kah_ had deliberated on the declaration made by theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries and the Social DemocratsInternationalists, and had accepted the proposition of proportionalrepresentation at the conference, even including delegates from theArmy Committees and the Peasants' Soviets....In the great hall, Trotzky recounted the events of the day."We offered the Vladimir _yunkers_ a chance to surrender," he said."We wanted to settle matters without bloodshed. But now that bloodhas been spilled there is only one way-pitiless struggle. It wouldbe childish to think we can win by any other means.... The moment isdecisive. Everybody must cooperate with the Military RevolutionaryCommittee, report where there are stores of barbed wire, benzine,guns.... We've won the power; now we must keep it!"The Menshevik Yoffe tried to read his party's declaration, butTrotzky refused to allow "a debate about principle.""Our debates are now in the streets," he cried. "The decisive stephas been taken. We all, and I in particular, take the responsibilityfor what is happening...."Soldiers from the front, from Gatchina, told their stories. One fromthe Death Battalion, Four Hundred Eighty-first Artillery: "When thetrenches hear of this, they will cry, 'This is _our_ Government!'" A_yunker_ from Peterhof said that he and two others had refused tomarch against the Soviets; and when his comrades had returned fromthe defence of the Winter Palace they appointed him their Commissar,to go to Smolny and offer their services to the _real_ Revolution....Then Trotzky again, fiery, indefatigable, giving orders, answeringquestions."The petty bourgeoisie, in order to defeat the workers, soldiers andpeasants, would combine with the devil himself!" he said once. Manycases of drunkenness had been remarked the last two days. "Nodrinking, comrades! No one must be on the streets after eight in theevening, except the regular guards. All places suspected of havingstores of liquor should be searched, and the liquor destroyed. (SeeApp. VIII, Sect. 4) No mercy to the sellers of liquor...."The Military Revolutionary Committee sent for the delegation fromthe Viborg section; then for the members from Putilov. They clumpedout hurriedly."For each revolutionist killed," said Trotzky, "we shall kill fivecounter-revolutionists!"Down-town again. The Duma brilliantly illuminated and great crowdspouring in. In the lower hall wailing and cries of grief; the throngsurged back and forth before the bulletin board, where was posted alist of _yunkers_ killed in the day's fighting-or supposed to bekilled, for most of the dead afterward turned up safe and sound.... Upin the Alexander Hall the Committee for Salvation held forth. Thegold and red epaulettes of officers were conspicuous, the familiarfaces of the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary intellectuals,the hard eyes and bulky magnificence of bankers and diplomats,officials of the old régime, and well-dressed women....The telephone girls were testifying. Girl after girl came to thetribune-over-dressed, fashion-aping little girls, with pinched facesand leaky shoes. Girl after girl, flushing with pleasure at theapplause of the "nice" people of Petrograd, of the officers, therich, the great names of politics-girl after girl, to narrate hersufferings at the hands of the proletariat, and proclaim her loyaltyto all that was old, established and powerful....The Duma was again in session in the Nicolai Hall. The Mayor saidhopefully that the Petrograd regiments were ashamed of theiractions; propaganda was making headway.[Graphic page-205 Proclamation for "wine pogroms" ]Revolutionary law and order. A proclamation of the Finland Regiment,in December, 1917, announcing desperate remedies for "wine pogroms."For translation see Appendix 5.... Emissaries came and went, reporting horrible deeds by theBolsheviki, interceding to save the _yunkers,_ busily investigating...."The Bolsheviki," said Trupp, "will be conquered by moral force, andnot by bayonets....."Meanwhile all was not well on the revolutionary front. The enemy hadbrought up armoured trains, mounted with cannon. The Soviet forces,mostly raw Red Guards, were without officers and without a definiteplan. Only five thousand regular soldiers had joined them; the restof the garrison was either busy suppressing the _yunker_ revolt,guarding the city, or undecided what to do. At ten in the eveningLenin addressed a meeting of delegates from the city regiments, whovoted overwhelmingly to fight. A Committee of five soldiers waselected to serve as General Staff, and in the small hours of themorning the regiments left their barracks in full battle array....Going home I saw them pass, swinging along with the regular tread ofveterans, bayonets in perfect alignment, through the desertedstreets of the conquered city....At the same time, in the headquarters of the _Vikzhel_ down on theSadovaya, the conference of all the Socialist parties to form a newGovernment was under way. Abramovitch, for the centre Mensheviki,said that there should be neither conquerors nor conquered-thatbygones should be bygones. ...In this were agreed all the left wingparties. Dan, speaking in the name of the right Mensheviki, proposedto the Bolsheviki the following conditions for a truce: The RedGuard to be disarmed, and the Petrograd garrison to be placed at theorders of the Duma; the troops of Kerensky not to fire a single shotor arrest a single man; a Ministry of all the Socialist parties_except the Bolsheviki._ For Smolny Riazanov and Kameniev declaredthat a coalition ministry of all parties was acceptable, butprotested at Dan's proposals. The Socialist Revolutionaries weredivided; but the Executive Committee of the Peasants's Soviets andthe Populist Socialists flatly refused to admit the Bolsheviki....After bitter quarrelling a commission was elected to draw up aworkable plan....All that night the commission wrangled, and all the next day, andthe next night. Once before, on the 9th of November, there had beena similar effort at conciliation, led by Martov and Gorky; but atthe approach of Kerensky and the activity of the Committee forSalvation, the right wing of the Mensheviki, SocialistRevolutionaries and Populist Socialists suddenly withdrew. Now theywere awed by the crushing of the _yunker_ rebellion...Monday the 12th was a day of suspense. The eyes of all Russia werefixed on the grey plain beyond the gates of Petrograd, where all theavailable strength of the old order faced the unorganised power ofthe new, the unknown. In Moscow a truce had been declared; bothsides parleyed, awaiting the result in the capital. Now thedelegates to the Congress of Soviets, hurrying on speeding trains tothe farthest reaches of Asia, were coming to their homes, carryingthe fiery cross. In wide-spreading ripples news of the miraclespread over the face of the land, and in its wake towns, cities andfar villages stirred and broke, Soviets and Military RevolutionaryCommittees against Dumas, Zemstvos and Government Commissars-RedGuards against White-street fighting and passionate speech.... Theresult waited on the word from Petrograd....Smolny was almost empty, but the Duma was thronged and noisy. Theold Mayor, in his dignified way, was protesting against the Appealof the Bolshevik Councillors."The Duma is not a centre of counter-revolution," he said, warmly."The Duma takes no part in the present struggle between the parties.But at a time when there is no legal power in the land, the onlycentre of order is the Municipal Self-Government. The peacefulpopulation recognises this fact; the foreign Embassies recogniseonly such documents as are signed by the Mayor of the town. The mindof a European does not admit of any other situation, as theMunicipal self-government is the only organ which is capable ofprotecting the interests of the citizens. The City is bound to showhospitality, to all organisations which desire to profit by suchhospitality, and therefore the Duma cannot prevent the distributionof any newspapers whatever within the Duma building. The sphere ofour work is increasing, and we must be given full liberty of action,and our rights must be respected by both parties...."We are perfectly neutral. When the Telephone Exchange was occupiedby the _yunkers_ Colonel Polkovnikov ordered the telephones toSmolny disconnected, but I protested, and the telephones were keptgoing...."At this there was ironic laughter from the Bolshevik benches, andimprecations from the right."And yet," went on Schreider, "they look upon us ascounter-revolutionaries and report us to the population. Theydeprive us of our means of transport by taking away our lastmotor-cars. It will not be our fault if there is famine in the town.Protests are of no use...."Kobozev, Bolshevik member of the Town Board, was doubtful whetherthe Military Revolutionary Committee had requisitioned the Municipalautomobiles. Even granting the fact, it was probably done by someunauthorised individual, in the emergency."The Mayor," he continued, "tells us that we must not make politicalmeetings out of the Duma. But every Menshevik and SocialistRevolutionary here talks nothing but party propaganda, and at thedoor they distribute their illegal newspapers, _Iskri_ (Sparks),_Soldatski Golos_ and _Rabotchaya Gazeta,_ inciting to insurrection.What if we Bolsheviki should also begin to distribute our papershere? But this shall not be, for we respect the Duma. We have notattacked the Municipal Self-Government, and we shall not do so. Butyou have addressed an Appeal to the population, and we are entitledalso to do so....Followed him Shingariov, Cadet, who said that there could be nocommon language with those who were liable to be brought before theAttorney General for indictment, and who must be tried on the chargeof treason.... He proposed again that all Bolshevik members should beexpelled from the Duma. This was tabled, however, for there were nopersonal charges against the members, and they were active in theMunicipal administration.Then two Mensheviki Internationalists, declaring that the Appeal ofthe Bolshevik Councillors was a direct incitement to massacre. "Ifeverything that is against the Bolsheviki is counter-revolutionary,"said Pinkevitch, "then I do not know the difference betweenrevolution and anarchy.... The Bolsheviki are depending upon thepassions of the unbridled masses; we have nothing but moral force.We will protest against massacres and violence from both sides, asour task is to find a peaceful issue.""The notice posted in the streets under the heading 'To thePillory,' which calls upon the people to destroy the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries," said Nazariev, "is a crime which you,Bolsheviki, will not be able to wash away. Yesterday's horrors arebut a preface to what you are preparing by such a proclamation.... Ihave always tried to reconcile you with the other parties, but atpresent I feel for you nothing but contempt!"The Bolshevik Councillors were on their feet, shouting angrily,assailed by hoarse, hateful voices and waving arms....Outside the hall I ran into the City Engineer, the Menshevik Gombergand three or four reporters. They were all in high spirits."See!" they said. "The cowards are afraid of us. They don't darearrest the Duma! Their Military Revolutionary Committee doesn't dareto send a Commissar into this building. Why, on the corner of theSadovaya to-day, I saw a Red Guard try to stop a boy selling_Soldatski Golos_.... The boy just laughed at him, and a crowd ofpeople wanted to lynch the bandit. It's only a few hours more, now.Even if Kerensky wouldn't come they haven't the men to run aGovernment. Absurd! I understand they're even fighting amongthemselves at Smolny!"A Socialist Revolutionary friend of mine drew me aside. "I knowwhere the Committee for Salvation is hiding," he said. "Do you wantto go and talk with them?"By this time it was dusk. The city had again settled down tonormal-shop-shutters up, lights shining, and on the streets greatcrowds of people slowly moving up and down and arguing....At Number 86 Nevsky we went through a passage into a courtyard,surrounded by tall apartment buildings. At the door of apartment 229my friend knocked in a peculiar way. There was a sound of scuffling;an inside door slammed; then the front door opened a crack and awoman's face appeared. After a minute's observation she led us in-aplacid-looking, middle-aged lady who at once cried, "Kyril, it's allright!" In the dining-room, where a samovar steamed on the table andthere were plates full of bread and raw fish, a man in uniformemerged from behind the window-curtains, and another, dressed like aworkman, from a closet. They were delighted to meet an Americanreporter. With a certain amount of gusto both said that they wouldcertainly be shot if the Bolsheviki caught them. They would not giveme their names, but both were Socialist Revolutionaries...."Why," I asked, "do you publish such lies in your newspapers?"Without taking offence the officer replied, "Yes, I know; but whatcan we do?" He shrugged. "You must admit that it is necessary for usto create a certain frame of mind in the people...."The other man interrupted. "This is merely an adventure on the partof the Bolsheviki. They have no intellectuals. ... The Ministrieswon't work.... Russia is not a city, but a whole country.... Realisingthat they can only last a few days, we have decided to come to theaid of the strongest force opposed to them-Kerensky-and help torestore order.""That is all very well," I said. "But why do you combine with theCadets?"The pseudo-workman smiled frankly. "To tell you the truth, at thismoment the masses of the people are following the Bolsheviki. Wehave no following-now. We can't mobilise a handful of soldiers.There are no arms available.... The Bolsheviki are right to a certainextent; there are at this moment in Russia only two parties with anyforce-the Bolsheviki and the reactionaries, who are all hiding underthe coat-tails of the Cadets. The Cadets think they are using us;but it is really we who are using the Cadets. When we smash theBolsheviki we shall turn against the Cadets....""Will the Bolsheviki be admitted into the new Government?"He scratched his head. "That's a problem," he admitted. "Of courseif they are not admitted, they'sll probably do this all over again.At any rate, they will have a chance to hold the balance of power inthe Constituent-that is, if there _is_ a Constituent.""And then, too," said the officer, "that brings up the question ofadmitting the Cadets into the new Government-and for the samereasons. You know the Cadets do not really want the ConstituentAssembly-not if the Bolsheviki can be destroyed now." He shook hishead. "It is not easy for us Russians, politics. You Americans areborn politicians; you have had politics all your lives. But forus-well, it has only been a year, you know!""What do you think of Kerensky?" I asked."Oh, Kerensky is guilty of the sins of the Provisional Government,"answered the other man. "Kerensky himself forced us to acceptcoalition with the bourgeoisie. If he had resigned, as hethreatened, it would have meant a new Cabinet crisis only sixteenweeks before the Constituent Assembly, and that we wanted to avoid.""But didn't it amount to that anyway?""Yes, but how were we to know? They tricked us-the Kerenskys andAvksentievs. Gotz is a little more radical. I stand with Tchernov,who is a real revolutionist.... Why, only to-day Lenin sent word thathe would not object to Tchernov entering the Government."We wanted to get rid of the Kerensky Government too, but we thoughtit better to wait for the Constituent.... At the beginning of thisaffair I was with the Bolsheviki, but the Central Committee of myparty voted unanimously against it-and what could I do? It was amatter of party discipline...."In a week the Bolshevik Government will go to pieces; if theSocialist Revolutionaries could only stand aside and wait, theGovernment would fall into their hands. But if we wait a week thecountry will be so disorganised that the German imperialists will bevictorious. That is why we began our revolt with only two regimentsof soldiers promising to support us-and they turned against us....That left only the _yunkers_....""How about the Cossacks?"The officer sighed. "They did not move. At first they said theywould come out if they had infantry support. They said moreover thatthey had their men with Kerensky, and that they were doing theirpart.... Then, too, they said that the Cossacks were always accused ofbeing the hereditary enemies of democracy.... And finally, 'TheBolsheviki promise that they will not take away our land. There isno danger to us. We remain neutral.'"During this talk people were constantly entering and leaving-most ofthem officers, their shoulder-straps torn off. We could see them inthe hall, and hear their low, vehement voices. Occasionally, throughthe half-drawn portières, we caught a glimpse of a door opening intoa bath-room, where a heavily-built officer in a colonel's uniformsat on the toilet, writing something on a pad held in his lap. Irecognised Colonel Polkovnikov, former commandant of Petrograd, forwhose arrest the Military Revolutionary Committee would have paid afortune."Our programme?" said the officer. "This is it. Land to be turnedover to the Land Committees. Workmen to have full representation inthe control of industry. An energetic peace programme, but not anultimatum to the world such as the Bolsheviki issued. The Bolshevikicannot keep their promises to the masses, even in the countryitself. We won't let them.... They stole our land programme in orderto get the support of the peasants. That is dishonest. If they hadwaited for the Constituent Assembly-""It doesn't matter about the Constituent Assembly!" broke in theofficer. "If the Bolsheviki want to establish a Socialist statehere, we cannot work with them in any event! Kerensky made the greatmistake. He let the Bolsheviki know what he was going to do byannouncing in the Council of the Republic that he had ordered theirarrest...."But what," I said, "do you intend to do now?"The two men looked at one another. "You will see in a few days. Ifthere are enough troops from the front on our side, we shall notcompromise with the Bolsheviki. If not, perhaps we shall be forcedto...."Out again on the Nevsky we swung on the step of a streetcar bulgingwith people, its platforms bent down from the weight and scrapingalong the ground, which crawled with agonising slowness the longmiles to Smolny.Meshkovsky, a neat, frail little man, was coming down the hall,looking worried. The strikes in the Ministries, he told us, werehaving their effect. For instance, the Council of People'sCommissars had promised to publish the Secret Treaties; but Neratov,the functionary in charge, had disappeared, taking the documentswith him. They were supposed to be hidden in the British Embassy....Worst of all, however, was the strike in the banks. "Without money,"said Menzhinsky, "we are helpless. The wages of the railroad men, ofthe postal and telegraph employees, must be paid.... The banks areclosed; and the key to the situation, the State Bank, is also shut.All the bank-clerks in Russia have been bribed to stop work...."But Lenin has issued an order to dynamite the State Bank vaults,and there is a Decree just out, ordering the private banks to opento-morrow, or we will open them ourselves!"The Petrograd Soviet was in full swing, thronged with armed men,Trotzky reporting:"The Cossacks are falling back from Krasnoye Selo." (Sharp, exultantcheering.) "But the battle is only beginning. At Pulkovo heavyfighting is going on. All available forces must be hurried there...."From Moscow, bad news. The Kremlin is in the hands of the_yunkers,_ and the workers have only a few arms. The result dependsupon Petrograd."At the front, the decrees on Peace and Land are provoking greatenthusiasm. Kerensky is flooding the trenches with tales ofPetrograd burning and bloody, of women and children massacred by theBolsheviki. But no one believes him...."The cruisers _Oleg, Avrora_ and _Respublica_ are anchored in theNeva, their guns trained on the approaches to the city....""Why aren't you out there with the Red Guards?" shouted a roughvoice."I'm going now!" answered Trotzky, and left the platform. His face alittle paler than usual, he passed down the side of the room,         e room,         |          |surrounded by eager friends, and hurried out to the waitingautomobile.Kameniev now spoke, describing the proceedings of the reconciliationconference. The armistice conditions proposed by the Mensheviki, hesaid, had been contemptuously rejected. Even the branches of theRailwaymen's Union had voted against such a proposition...."Now that we've won the power and are sweeping all Russia," hedeclared, "all they ask of us are three little things: 1. Tosurrender the power. 2. To make the soldiers continue the war. 3. Tomake the peasants forget about the land...."Lenin appeared for a moment, to answer the accusations of theSocialist Revolutionaries:"They charge us with stealing their land programme.... If that is so,we bow to them. It is good enough for us...."So the meeting roared on, leader after leader explaining, exhorting,arguing, soldier after soldier, workman after workman, standing upto speak his mind and his heart.... The audience flowed, changing andrenewed continually. From time to time men came in, yelling for themembers of such and such a detachment, to go to the front; others,relieved, wounded, or coming to Smolny for arms and equipment,poured in....It was almost three o'clock in the morning when, as we left thehall, Holtzman, of the Military Revolutionary Committee, camerunning down the hall with a transfigured face."It's all right!" he shouted, grabbing my hands. "Telegram from thefront. Kerensky is smashed! Look at this!"He held out a sheet of paper, scribbled hurriedly in pencil, andthen, seeing we couldn't read it, he declaimed aloud:Pulkovo. Staff. 2.10 A.M.The night of October 30th to 31st will go down in history. Theattempt of Kerensky to move counter-revolutionary troops against thecapital of the Revolution has been decisively repulsed. Kerensky isretreating, we are advancing. The soldiers, sailors and workers ofPetrograd have shown that they can and will with arms in their handsenforce the will and authority of the democracy. The bourgeoisietried to isolate the revolutionary army. Kerensky attempted to breakit by the force of the Cossacks. Both plans met a pitiful defeat.The grand idea of the domination of the worker and peasant democracyclosed the ranks of the army and hardened its will. All the countryfrom now on will be convinced that the Power of the Soviets is noephemeral thing, but an invincible fact.... The repulse of Kerensky isthe repulse of the land-owners, the bourgeoisie and the Kornilovistsin general. The repulse of Kerensky is the confirmation of the rightof the people to a peaceful free life, to land, bread and power. ThePulkovo detachment by its valorous blow has strengthened the causeof the Workers' and Peasants's Revolution. There is no return to thepast. Before us are struggles, obstacles and sacrifices. But theroad is clear and victory is certain.Revolutionary Russia and the Soviet Power can be proud of theirPulkovo detachment, acting under the command of Colonel Walden.Eternal memory to those who fell! Glory to the warriors of theRevolution, the soldiers and the officers who were faithful to thePeople!Long live revolutionary, popular, Socialist Russia!In the name of the Council,L. TROTZKY, People's Commissar....Driving home across Znamensky Square, we made out an unusual crowdin front of the Nicolai Railway Station. Several thousand sailorswere massed there, bristling with rifles.Standing on the steps, a member of the _Vikzhel_ was pleading withthem."Comrades, we cannot carry you to Moscow. We are neutral. We do notcarry troops for either side. We cannot take you to Moscow, wherealready there is terrible civil war...."All the seething Square roared at him; the sailors began to surgeforward. Suddenly another door was flung wide; in it stood two orthree brakeman, a fireman or so."This way, comrades!" cried one. "We will take you to Moscow-orVladivostok, if you like! Long live the Revolution!"                              Chapter IX                               Victory_Order Number I_To the Troops of the Pulkovo Detachment.November 13, 1917. 38 minutes past 9 a. m.After a cruel fight the troops of the Pulkovo detachment completelyrouted the counter-revolutionary forces, who retreated from theirpositions in disorder, and under cover of Tsarskoye Selo fell backtoward Pavlovsk II and Gatchina.Our advanced units occupied the northeastern extremity of TsarskoyeSelo and the station Alexandrovskaya. The Colpinno detachment was onour left, the Krasnoye Selo detachment to our right.I ordered the Pulkovo forces to occupy Tsarskoye Selo, to fortifyits approaches, especially on the side of Gatchina.Also to pass and occupy Pavlovskoye, fortifying its southern side,and to take up the railroad as far as Dno.The troops must take all measures to strengthen the positionsoccupied by them, arranging trenches and other defensive works.They must enter into close liaison with the detachments of Colpinnoand Krasnoye Selo, and also with the Staff of the Commander in Chieffor the Defence of Petrograd.Signed,_Commander in Chief aver all Forces acting against theCounter-revolutionary Troops of Kerensky,_Lieutenant-Colonel MURAVIOV.Tuesday morning. But how is this? Only two days ago the Petrogradcampagna was full of leaderless bands, wandering aimlessly; withoutfood, without artillery, without a plan. What had fused thatdisorganised mass of undisciplined Red Guards, and soldiers withoutofficers, into an army obedient to its own elected high command,tempered to meet and break the assault of cannon and Cossackcavalry? (See App. IX, Sect. 1)People in revolt have a way of defying military precedent. Theragged armies of the French Revolution are not forgotten-Valmy andthe Lines of Weissembourg. Massed against the Soviet forces were_yunkers,_ Cossacks, land-owners, nobility, Black Hundreds-the Tsarcome again, _Okhrana_ and Siberian chains; and the vast and terriblemenace of the Germans.... Victory, in the words of Carlyle, meant"Apotheosis and Millennium without end!"Sunday night, the Commissars of the Military Revolutionary Committeereturning desperately from the field, the garrison of Petrogradelected its Committee of Five, its Battle Staff, three soldiers andtwo officers, all certified free from counter-revolutionary taint.Colonel Muraviov, ex-patriot, was in command-an efficient man, butto be carefully watched. At Colpinno, at Obukhovo, at Pulkovo andKrasnoye Selo were formed provisional detachments, increased in sizeas the stragglers came in from the surrounding country-mixedsoldiers, sailors and Red Guards, parts of regiments, infantry,cavalry and artillery all together, and a few armoured cars.Day broke, and the pickets of Kerensky's Cossacks came in touch.Scattered rifle-fire, summons to surrender. Over the bleak plain onthe cold quiet air spread the sound of battle, falling upon the earsof roving bands as they gathered about their little fires, waiting....So it was beginning! They made toward the battle; and the workerhordes pouring out along the straight roads quickened their pace....Thus upon all the points of attack automatically converged angryhuman swarms, to be met by Commissars and assigned positions, orwork to do. This was _their_ battle, for _their_ world; the officersin command were elected by _them._ For the moment that incoherentmultiple will was one will....Those who participated in the fighting described to me how thesailors fought until they ran out of cartridges, and then stormed;how the untrained workmen rushed the charging Cossacks and tore themfrom their horses; how the anonymous hordes of the people, gatheringin the darkness around the battle, rose like a tide and poured overthe enemy.... Before midnight of Monday the Cossacks broke and werefleeing, leaving their artillery behind them, and the army of theproletariat, on a long ragged front, moved forward and rolled intoTsarskoye, before the enemy had a chance to destroy the greatGovernment wireless station, from which now the Commissars of Smolnywere hurling out to the world paeans of triumph....TO ALL SOVIETS OF WORKERS' AND SOLDIERS' DEPUTIESThe 12th of November, in a bloody combat near Tsarskoye Selo, therevolutionary army defeated the counter-revolutionary troops ofKerensky and Kornilov. In the name of the Revolutionary Government Iorder all regiments to take the offensive against the enemies of therevolutionary democracy, and to take all measures to arrestKerensky, and also to oppose any adventure which might menace theconquests of the Revolution and the victory of the proletariat.Long live the Revolutionary Army!MURAVIOV.News from the provinces....At Sevastopol the local Soviet had assumed the power; a huge meetingof the sailors on the battleships in the harbour had forced theirofficers to line up and swear allegiance to the new Government. AtNizhni Novgorod the Soviet was in control. From Kazan came reportsof a battle in the streets, _yunkers_ and a brigade of artilleryagainst the Bolshevik garrison....Desperate fighting had broken out again in Moscow. The _yunkers_ andWhite Guards held the Kremlin and the centre of the town, beatenupon from all sides by the troops of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee. The Soviet artillery was stationed in Skobeliev Square,bombarding the City Duma building, the Prefecture and the HotelMetropole. The cobblestones of the Tverskaya and Nikitskaya had beentorn up for trenches and barricades. A hail of machine-gun fireswept the quarters of the great banks and commercial houses. Therewere no lights, no telephones; the bourgeois population lived in thecellars.... The last bulletin said that the Military RevolutionaryCommittee had delivered an ultimatum to the Committee of PublicSafety, demanding the immediate surrender of the Kremlin, orbombardment would follow."Bombard the Kremlin?" cried the ordinary citizen. "They dare not!"From Vologda to Chita in far Siberia, from Pskov to Sevastopol onthe Black Sea, in great cities and little villages, civil war burstinto flame. From thousands of factories, peasant communes, regimentsand armies, ships on the wide sea, greetings poured intoPetrograd-greetings to the Government of the People.The Cossack Government at Novotcherkask telegraphed to Kerensky,_"The Government of the Cossack troops invites the ProvisionalGovernment and the members of the Council of the Republic to come,if possible, to Novotcherkask, where we can organise in common thestruggle against the Bolsheviki."_In Finland, also, things were stirring. The Soviet of Helsingforsand the _Tsentrobalt_ (Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet),jointly proclaimed a state of siege, and declared that all attemptsto interfere with the Bolshevik forces, and all armed resistance toits orders, would be severely repressed. At the same time theFinnish Railway Union called a countrywide general strike, to putinto operation the laws passed by the Socialist Diet of June, 1917,dissolved by Kerensky....Early in the morning I went out to Smolny. Going up the long woodensidewalk from the outer gate I saw the first thin, hesitatingsnow-flakes fluttering down from the grey, windless sky. "Snow!"cried the soldier at the door, grinning with delight. "Good for thehealth!" Inside, the long, gloomy halls and bleak rooms seemeddeserted. No one moved in all the enormous pile. A deep, uneasysound came to my ears, and looking around, I noticed that everywhereon the floor, along the walls, men were sleeping. Rough, dirty men,workers and soldiers, spattered and caked with mud, sprawled aloneor in heaps, in the careless attitudes of death. Some wore raggedbandages marked with blood. Guns and cartridge-belts were scatteredabout.... The victorious proletarian army!In the upstairs buffet so thick they lay that one could hardly walk.The air was foul. Through the clouded windows a pale light streamed.A battered samovar, cold, stood on the counter, and many glassesholding dregs of tea. Beside them lay a copy of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee's last bulletin, upside down, scrawled withpainful hand-writing. It was a memorial written by some soldier tohis comrades fallen in the fight against Kerensky, just as he hadset it down before falling on the floor to sleep. The writing wasblurred with what looked like tears....Alexei VinogradovD. MaskvinS. StolbikovA. VoskressenskyD. LeonskyD. PreobrazhenskyV. LaidanskyM.

Under the earth of the grave__You have straitly closed your ranks. Sleep, Citizens!_Only the Military Revolutionary Committee still functioned,unsleeping. Skripnik, emerging from the inner room, said that Gotzhad been arrested, but had flatly denied signing the proclamation ofthe Committee for Salvation, as had Avksentiev; and the Committeefor Salvation itself had repudiated the Appeal to the garrison.There was still disafiection among the city regiments, Skripnikreported; the Volhynsky Regiment had refused to fight againstKerensky.Several detachments of "neutral" troops, with Tchernov at theirhead, were at Gatchina, trying to persuade Kerensky to halt hisattack on Petrograd.Skripnik laughed. "There can be no 'neutrals' now," he said. "We'vewon!" His sharp, bearded face glowed with an almost religiousexaltation. "More than sixty delegates have arrived from the Front,with assurances of support by all the armies except the troops onthe Rumanian front, who have not been heard from. The ArmyCommittees have suppressed all news from Petrograd, but we now havea regular system of couriers...."[Graphic page-224 Certificate approving telegram transmission]Order given me at Staff headquarters by command of the Council ofPeople's Commissars, to transmit the first despatch out of Perogradafter the November Revolution, over the Government wires to America.

For the Commander in Chief, ANTONOV                      Chief of Staff, VLAD. BONCH-BRUEVITCHDown in the front hall Kameniev was just entering, worn out by theall-night session of the Conference to Form a New Government, buthappy. "Already the Socialist Revolutionaries are inclined to admitus into the new Government," he told me. "The right wing groups arefrightened by the Revolutionary Tribunals; they demand, in a sort ofpanic, that we dissolve them before going any further. ... We haveaccepted the proposition of the _Vikzhel_ to form a homogeneousSocialist Ministry, and they're working on that now. You see, it allsprings from our victory. When we were down, they would't have us atany price; not everybody's in favour of some agreement with theSoivets.... What we need is a really decisive victory. Kerensky wantsan armistice, but he'll have to surrender (See App. IX, Sect. 2) ...."That was the temper of the Bolshevik leaders. To a foreignjournalist who asked Trotzky what statement he had to make to theworld, Trotzky replied: "At this moment the only statement possibleis the one we are making through the mouths of our cannon!"But there was an undercurrent of real anxiety in the tide ofvictory; the question of finances. Instead of opening the banks, ashad been ordered by the Military Revolutionary Committee, the Unionof Bank Employees had held a meeting and declared a formal strike.Smolny had demanded some thirty-five millions of rubles from theState Bank, and the cashier had locked the vaults, only paying outmoney to the representatives of the Provisional Government. Thereactionaries were using the State Bank as a political weapon; forinstance, when the _Vikzhel_ demanded money to pay the salaries ofthe employees of the Government railroads, it was told to apply toSmolny....I went to the State Bank to see the new Commissar, a redhairedUkrainean Bolshevik named Petrovitch. He was trying to bring orderout of the chaos in which affairs had been left by the strikingclerks. In all the offices of the huge place perspiring volunteerworkers, soldiers and sailors, their tongues sticking out of theirmouths in the intensity of their effort, were poring over the greatledgers with a bewildered air....The Duma building was crowded. There were still isolated cases ofdefiance toward the new Government, but they were rare. The CentralLand Committee had appealed to the Peasants, ordering them not torecognise the Land Decree passed by the Congress of the Soviets,because it would cause confusion and civil war. Mayor Schreiderannounced that because of the Bolshevik insurrection, the electionsto the Constituent Assembly would have to be indefinitely postponed.Two questions seemed to be uppermost in all minds, shocked by theferocity of the civil war; first, a truce to the bloodshed (See App.IX, Sect. 3)-second, the creation of a new Government. There was nolonger any talk of "destroying the Bolsheviki"-and very little aboutexcluding them from the Government, except from the PopulistSocialists and the Peasants' Soviets. Even the Central ArmyCommittee at the _Stavka,_ the most determined enemy of Smolny,telephoned from Moghilev: "If, to constitute the new Ministry, it isnecessary to come to an understanding with the Bolsheviki, we agreeto admit them _in a minority_ to the Cabinet."_Pravda,_ ironically calling attention to Kerensky's "humanitariansentiments," published his despatch to the Committee for Salvation:In accord with the proposals of the Committee for Salvation and allthe democratic organisations united around it, I have halted allmilitary action against the rebels. A delegate of the Committee hasbeen sent to enter into negotiations. Take all measures to stop theuseless shedding of blood.The _Vikzhel_ sent a telegram to all Russia:The Conference of the Union of Railway Workers with therepresentatives of both the belligerent parties, who admit thenecessity of an agreement, protest energetically against the use ofpolitical terrorism in the civil war, especially when it is carriedon between different factions of the revolutionary democracy, anddeclare that political terrorism, in whatever form, is incontradiction to the very idea of the negotiations for a newGovernment....[Graphic page-227 Leaflet ]Popular leaflet sold in the streets just after the Bolshevikinsurrection, containing rhymes and jokes about the defeatedbourgeoisie and the "moderate" Socialist leaders, Called, "How THEBOORZHUI (BOURGEOISIE) LOST THE POWER."Delegations from the Conference were sent to the Front, to Gatchina.In the Conference itself everything seemed on the point of finalsettlement. It had even been decided to elect a Provisional People'sCouncil, composed of about four hundred members-seventy-fiverepresenting Smolny, seventy-five the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and therest split up among the Town Dumas, the Trade Unions, LandCommittees and political parties. Tchernov was mentioned as the newPremier. Lenin and Trotzky, rumour said, were to be excluded....About noon I was again in front of Smolny, talking with the driverof an ambulance bound for the revolutionary front. Could I go withhim? Certainly! He was a volunteer, a University student, and as werolled down the street shouted over his shoulder to me phrases ofexecrable German: _"Also, gut! Wir nach die Kasernen zu essengehen!"_ I made out that there would be lunch at some barracks.On the Kirotchnaya we turned into an immense courtyard surrounded bymilitary buildings, and mounted a dark stairway to a low room lit byone window. At a long wooden table were seated some twenty soldiers,eating _shtchi_ (cabbage soup) from a great tin wash-tub with woodenspoons, and talking loudly with much laughter."Welcome to the Battalion Committee of the Sixth Reserve Engineers'Battalion!" cried my friend, and introduced me as an AmericanSocialist. Whereat every one rose to shake my hand, and one oldsoldier put his arms around me and gave me a hearty kiss. A woodenspoon was produced and I took my place at the table. Another tub,full of _kasha,_ was brought in, a huge loaf of black bread, and ofcourse the inevitable tea-pots. At once every one began asking mequestions about America: Was it true that people in a free countrysold their votes for _money?_ If so, how did they get what theywanted? How about this "Tammany"? Was it true that in a free countrya little group of people could control a whole city, and exploitedit for their personal benefit? Why did the people stand it? Evenunder the Tsar such things could not happen in Russia; true, herethere was always graft, but to buy and sell a whole city full ofpeople! And in a free country! Had the people no revolutionaryfeeling? I tried to explain that in my country people tried tochange things by law."Of course," nodded a young sergeant, named Baklanov, who spokeFrench. "But you have a highly developed capitalist class? Then thecapitalist class must control the legislatures and the courts. Howthen can the people change things? I am open to conviction, for I donot know your country; but to me it is incredible...."I said that I was going to Tsarskoye Selo. "I, too," said Baklanov,suddenly. "And I-and I-" The whole roomful decided on the spot to goto Tsarskoye Selo.Just then came a knock on the door. It opened, and in it stood thefigure of the Colonel. No one rose, but all shouted a greeting. "MayI come in?" asked the Colonel. "_Prosim! Prosim!_" they answeredheartily. He entered, smiling, a tall, distinguished figure in agoat-skin cape embroidered with gold. "I think I heard you say thatyou were going to Tsarskoye Selo, comrades," he said. "Could I gowith you?"Baklanov considered. "I do not think there is anything to be donehere to-day," he answered. "Yes, comrade, we shall be very glad tohave you." The Colonel thanked him and sat down, filling a glass oftea.In a low voice, for fear of wounding the Colonel's pride, Baklanovexplained to me. "You see, I am the chairman of the Committee. Wecontrol the Battalion absolutely, except in action, when the Colonelis delegated by us to command. In action his orders must be obeyed,but he is strictly responsible to us. In barracks he must ask ourpermission before taking any action.... You might call him ourExecutive Officer...."Arms were distributed to us, revolvers and rifles-"we might meetsome Cossacks, you know"-and we all piled into the ambulance,together with three great bundles of newspapers for the front.Straight down the Liteiny we rattled, and along the ZagorodnyProspekt. Next to me sat a youth with the shoulder-straps of aLieutenant, who seemed to speak all European languages with equalfluency. He was a member of the Battalion Committee."I am not a Bolshevik," he assured me, emphatically. "My family is avery ancient and noble one. I, myself, am, you might say, a Cadet....""But how--?" I began, bewildered."Oh, yes, I am a member of the Committee. I make no secret of mypolitical opinions, but the others do not mind, because they know Ido not believe in opposing the will of the majority.... I have refusedto take any action in the present civil war, however, for I do notbelieve in taking up arms against my brother Russians....""Provocator! Kornilovitz!" the others cried at him gaily, slappinghim on the shoulder....Passing under the huge grey stone archway of the Moskovsky Gate,covered with golden hieroglyphics, ponderous Imperial eagles and thenames of Tsars, we sped out on the wide straight highway, grey withthe first light fall of snow. It was thronged with Red Guards,stumbling along on foot toward the revolutionary front, shouting andsinging; and others, greyfaced and muddy, coming back. Most of themseemed to be mere boys. Women with spades, some with rifles andbandoleers, others wearing the Red Cross on their arm-bands-thebowed, toil-worm women of the slums. Squads of soldiers marching outof step, with an affectionate jeer for the Red Guards; sailors,grim-looking; children with bundles of food for their fathers andmothers; all these, coming and going, trudged through the whitenedmud that covered the cobbles of the highway inches deep. We passedcannon, jingling southward with their caissons; trucks bound bothways, bristling with armed men; ambulances full of wounded from thedirection of the battle, and once a peasant cart, creaking slowlyalong, in which sat a white-faced boy bent over his shatteredstomach and screaming monotonously. In the fields on either sidewomen and old men were digging trenches and stringing barbed wireentanglements.Back northward the clouds rolled away dramatically, and the pale suncame out. Across the flat, marshy plain Petrograd glittered. To theright, white and gilded and coloured bulbs and pinnacles; to theleft, tall chimneys, some pouring out black smoke; and beyond, alowering sky over Finland. On each side of us were churches,monasteries.... Occasionally a monk was visible, silently watching thepulse of the proletarian army throbbing on the road.At Pulkovo the road divided, and there we halted in the midst of agreat crowd, where the human streams poured from three directions,friends meeting, excited and congratulatory, describing the battleto one another. A row of houses facing the cross-roads was markedwith bullets, and the earth was trampled into mud half a milearound. The fighting had been furious here.... In the near distanceriderless Cossack horses circled hungrily, for the grass of theplain had died long ago. Right in front of us an awkward Red Guardwas trying to ride one, falling off again and again, to thechildlike delight of a thousand rough men.The left road, along which the remnants of the Cossacks hadretreated, led up a little hill to a hamlet, where there was aglorious view of the immense plain, grey as a windless sea,tumultuous clouds towering over, and the imperial city disgorgingits thousands along all the roads. Far over to the left lay thelittle hill of Kranoye Selo, the parade-ground of the ImperialGuards' summer camp, and the Imperial Dairy. In the middle distancenothing broke the flat monotony but a few walled monasteries andconvents, some isolated factories, and several large buildings withunkempt grounds that were asylums and orphanages...."Here," said the driver, as we went on over a barren hill, "here waswhere Vera Slutskaya died. Yes, the Bolshevik member of the Duma. Ithappened early this morning. She was in an automobile, with Zalkindand another man. There was a truce, and they started for the fronttrenches. They were talking and laughing, when all of a sudden, fromthe armoured train in which Kerensky himself was riding, somebodysaw the automobile and fired a cannon. The shell struck VeraSlutskaya and killed her...."And so we came into Tsarskoye, all bustling with the swaggeringheroes of the proletarian horde. Now the palace where the Soviet hadmet was a busy place. Red Guards and sailors filled the court-yard,sentries stood at the doors, and a stream of couriers and Commissarspushed in and out. In the Soviet room a samovar had been set up, andfifty or more workers, soldiers, sailors and officers stood around,drinking tea and talking at the top of their voices. In one cornertwo clumsy-handed workingmen were trying to make a multigraphingmachine go. At the centre table, the huge Dybenko bent over a map,marking out positions for the troops with red and blue pencils. Inhis free hand he carried, as always, the enormous bluesteelrevolver. Anon he sat himself down at a typewriter and pounded awaywith one finger; every little while he would pause, pick up therevolver, and lovingly spin the chamber.A couch lay along the wall, and on this was stretched a youngworkman. Two Red Guards were bending over him, but the rest of thecompany did not pay any attention. In his breast was a hole; throughhis clothes fresh blood came welling up with every heart-beat. Hiseyes were closed and his young, bearded face was greenish-white.Faintly and slowly he still breathed, with every breath sighing,_"Mir boudit! Mir boudit!_ (Peace is coming! Peace is coming!)"Dybenko looked up as we came in. "Ah," he said to Baklanov."Comrade, will you go up to the Commandant's headquarters and takecharge? Wait; I will write you credentials." He went to thetypewriter and slowly picked out the letters.The new Commandant of Tsarskoye Selo and I went toward the EkaterinaPalace, Baklanov very excited and important. In the same ornate,white room some Red Guards were rummaging curiously around, while myold friend, the Colonel, stood by the window biting his moustache.He greeted me like a long-lost brother. At a table near the door satthe French Bessarabian. The Bolsheviki had ordered him to remain,and continue his work."What could I do?" he muttered. "People like myself cannot fight oneither side in such a war as this, no matter how much we mayinstinctively dislike the dictatorship of the mob.... I only regretthat I am so far from my mother in Bessarabia!"Baklanov was formally taking over the office from the Commandant."Here," said the Colonel nervously, "are the keys to the desk."A Red Guard interrupted. "Where's the money?" he asked rudely. TheColonel seemed surprised. "Money? Money? Ah, you mean the chest.There it is," said the Colonel, "just as I found it when I tookpossession three days ago. Keys?" The Colonel shrugged. "I have nokeys."The Red Guard sneered knowingly. "Very convenient," he said."Let us open the chest," said Baklanov. "Bring an axe. Here is anAmerican comrade. Let him smash the chest open, and write down whathe finds there."I swung the axe. The wooden chest was empty."Let's arrest him," said the Red Guard, venomously. "He isKerensky's man. He has stolen the money and given it to Kerensky."Baklanov did not want to. "Oh, no," he said. "It was the Kornilovitzbefore him. He is not to blame."The devil!" cried the Red Guard. "He is Kerensky's man, I tell you.If _you_ won't arrest him, then _we_ will, and we'll take him toPetrograd and put him in Peter-Paul, where he belongs!" At this theother Red Guards growled assent. With a piteous glance at us theColonel was led away....Down in front of the Soviet palace an auto-truck was going to thefront. Half a dozen Red Guards, some sailors, and a soldier or two,under command of a huge workman, clambered in, and shouted to me tocome along. Red Guards issued from headquarters, each of themstaggering under an arm-load of small, corrugated-iron bombs, filledwith _grubit_-which, they say, is ten times as strong, and fivetimes as sensitive as dynamite; these they threw into the truck. Athree-inch cannon was loaded and then tied onto the tail of thetruck with bits of rope and wire.We started with a shout, at top speed of course; the heavy truckswaying from side to side. The cannon leaped from one wheel to theother, and the _grubit_ bombs went rolling back and forth over ourfeet, fetching up against the sides of the car with a crash.The big Red Guard, whose name was Vladimir Nicolaievitch, plied mewith questions about America. "Why did America come into the war?Are the American workers ready to throw over the capitalists? Whatis the situation in the Mooney case now? Will they extradite Berkmanto San Francisco?" and other, very difficult to answer, alldelivered in a shout above the roaring of the truck, while we heldon to each other and danced amid the caroming bombs.Occasionally a patrol tried to stop us. Soldiers ran out into theroad before us, shouted _"Shtoi!"_ and threw up their guns.We paid no attention. "The devil take you!" cried the Red Guards."We don't stop for anybody! We're Red Guards!" And we thunderedimperiously on, while Vladimir Nicolaievitch bellowed to me aboutthe internationalisation of the Panama Canal, and such matters....About five miles out we saw a squad of sailors marching back, andslowed down."Where's the front, brothers?"The foremost sailor halted and scratched his head. "This morning,"he said, "it was about half a kilometer down the road. But the damnthing isn't anywhere now. We walked and walked and walked, but wecouldn't find it."They climbed into the truck, and we proceeded. It must have beenabout a mile further that Vladimir Nicolaievitch cocked his ear andshouted to the chauffeur to stop."Firing!" he said. "Do you hear it?" For a moment dead silence, andthen, a little ahead and to the left, three shots in rapidsuccession. Along here the side of the road was heavily wooded. Verymuch excited now, we crept along, speaking in whispers, until thetruck was nearly opposite the place where the firing had come from.Descending, we spread out, and every man carrying his rifle, wentstealthily into the forest.Two comrades, meanwhile, detached the cannon and slewed it arounduntil it aimed as nearly as possible at our backs.It was silent in the woods. The leaves were gone, and thetree-trunks were a pale wan colour in the low, sickly autumn sun.Not a thing moved, except the ice of little woodland pools shiveringunder our feet. Was it an ambush?We went uneventfully forward until the trees began to thin, andpaused. Beyond, in a little clearing, three soldiers sat around asmall fire, perfectly oblivious.Vladimir Nicolaievitch stepped forward. _"Zra'zvuitye,_ comrades!"he greeted, while behind him one cannon, twenty rifles and atruck-load of _grubit_ bombs hung by a hair. The soldiers scrambledto their feet."What was the shooting going on around here?"One of the soldiers answered, looking relieved, "Why we were justshooting a rabbit or two, comrade...."The truck hurtled on toward Romanov, through the bright, empty day.At the first cross-roads two soldiers ran out in front of us, wavingtheir rifles. We slowed down, and stopped."Passes, comrades!"The Red Guards raised a great clamour. "We are Red Guards. We don'tneed any passes.... Go on, never mind them!"But a sailor objected. "This is wrong, comrades. We must haverevolutionary discipline. Suppose some counterrevolutionaries camealong in a truck and said: 'We don't need any passes?' The comradesdon't know you."At this there was a debate. One by one, however, the sailors andsoldiers joined with the first. Grumbling, each Red Guard producedhis dirty _bumaga_ (paper). All were alike except mine, which hadbeen issued by the Revolutionary Staff at Smolny. The sentriesdeclared that I must go with them. The Red Guards objectedstrenuously, but the sailor who had spoken first insisted. "Thiscomrade we know to be a true comrade," he said. "But there areorders of the Committee, and these orders must be obeyed. That isrevolutionary discipline...."In order not to make any trouble, I got down from the truck, andwatched it disappear careening down the road, all the company wavingfarewell. The soldiers consulted in low tones for a moment, and thenled me to a wall, against which they placed me. It flashed upon mesuddenly; they were going to shoot me!In all three directions not a human being was in sight. The onlysign of life was smoke from the chimney of a _datchya,_ a ramblingwooden house a quarter of a mile up the side road. The two soldierswere walking out into the road. Desperately I ran after them."But comrades! See! Here is the seal of the Military RevolutionaryCommittee!"They stared stupidly at my pass, then at each other."It is different from the others," said one, sullenly. "We cannotread, brother."I took him by the arm. "Come!" I said. "Let's go to that house. Someone there can surely read." They hesitated. "No," said one. Theother looked me over. "Why not?" he muttered. "After all, it is aserious crime to kill an innocent man."We walked up to the front door of the house and knocked. A short,stout woman opened it, and shrank back in alarm, babbling, "I don'tknow anything about them! I don't know anything about them!" One ofmy guards held out the pass. She screamed. "Just to read it,comrade." Hesitatingly she took the paper and read aloud, swiftly:The bearer of this pass, John Reed, is a representative of theAmerican Social-Democracy, an internationalist....Out on the road again the two soldiers held another consultation."We must take you to the Regimental Committee," they said. In thefast-deepening twilight we trudged along the muddy road.Occasionally we met squads of soldiers, who stopped and surroundedme with looks of menace, handling my pass around and arguingviolently as to whether or not I should be killed....It was dark when we came to the barracks of the Second TsarskoyeSelo Rifles, low sprawling buildings huddled along the post-road. Anumber of soldiers slouching at the entrance asked eager questions.A spy? A provocator? We mounted a winding stair and emerged into agreat, bare room with a huge stove in the centre, and rows of cotson the floor, where about a thousand soldiers were playing cards,talking, singing, and asleep. In the roof was a jagged hole made byKerensky's cannon....I stood in the doorway, and a sudden silence ran among the groups,who turned and stared at me. Of a sudden they began to move, slowlyand then with a rush, thundering, with faces full of hate."Comrades! Comrades!" yelled one of my guards. "Committee!Committee!" The throng halted, banked around me, muttering. Out ofthem shouldered a lean youth, wearing a red arm-band."Who is this?" he asked roughly. The guards explained. "Give me thepaper!" He read it carefully, glancing at me with keen eyes. Then hesmiled and handed me the pass. "Comrades, this is an Americancomrade. I am Chairman of the Committee, and I welcome you to theRegiment...." A sudden general buzz grew into a roar of greeting, andthey pressed forward to shake my hand."You have not dined? Here we have had our dinner. You shall go tothe Officers' Club, where there are some who speak your language...."He led me across the court-yard to the door of another building. Anaristocratic-looking youth, with the shoulder straps of aLieutenant, was entering. The Chairman presented me, and shakinghands, went back."I am Stepan Georgevitch Morovsky, at your service," said theLieutenant, in perfect French. From the ornate entrance hall aceremonial staircase led upward, lighted by glittering lustres. Onthe second floor billiard-rooms, card-rooms, a library opened fromthe hall. We entered the dining-room, at a long table in the centreof which sat about twenty officers in full uniform, wearing theirgold- and silver-handled swords, the ribbons and crosses of Imperialdecorations. All rose politely as I entered, and made a place for mebeside the Colonel, a large, impressive man with a grizzled beard.Orderlies were deftly serving dinner. The atmosphere was that of anyofficers' mess in Europe. Where was the Revolution?"You are not Bolsheviki?" I asked Morovsky.A smile went around the table, but I caught one or two glancingfurtively at the orderly."No," answered my friend. "There is only one Bolshevik officer inthis regiment. He is in Petrograd to-night. The Colonel is aMenshevik. Captain Kherlov there is a Cadet. I myself am a SocialistRevolutionary of the right wing.... I should say that most of theofficers in the Army are not Bolsheviki, but like me they believe indemocracy; they believe that they must follow the soldier-masses...."Dinner over, maps were brought, and the Colonel spread them out onthe table. The rest crowded around to see."Here," said the Colonel, pointing to pencil marks, "were ourpositions this morning. Vladimir Kyrilovitch, where is your company?"Captain Kherlov pointed. "According to orders, we occupied theposition along this road. Karsavin relieved me at five o'clock."Just then the door of the room opened, and there entered theChairman of the Regimental Committee, with another soldier. Theyjoined the group behind the Colonel, peering at the map.              map.              |          |"Good," said the Colonel. "Now the Cossacks have fallen back tenkilometres in our sector. I do not think it is necessary to take upadvanced positions. Gentlemen, for to-night you will hold thepresent line, strengthening the positions by--""If you please," interrupted the Chairman of the RegimentalCommittee. "The orders are to advance with all speed, and prepare toengage the Cossacks north of Gatchina in the morning. A crushingdefeat is necessary. Kindly make the proper dispositions."There was a short silence. The Colonel again turned to the map."Very well," he said, in a different voice. "Stepan Georgevitch, youwill please--" Rapidly tracing lines with a blue pencil, he gave hisorders, while a sergeant made shorthand notes. The sergeant thenwithdrew, and ten minutes later returned with the orderstypewritten, and one carbon copy. The Chairman of the Committeestudied the map with a copy of the orders before him."All right," he said, rising. Folding the carbon copy, he put it inhis pocket. Then he signed the other, stamped it with a round sealtaken from his pocket, and presented it to the Colonel....Here was the Revolution!I returned to the Soviet palace in Tsarskoye in the Regimental Staffautomobile. Still the crowds of workers, soldiers and sailorspouring in and out, still the choking press of trucks, armouredcars, cannon before the door, and the shouting, the laughter ofunwonted victory. Half a dozen Red Guards forced their way through,a priest in the middle. This was Father Ivan, they said, who hadblessed the Cossacks when they entered the town. I heard afterwardthat he was shot.... (See App. IX, Sect. 4)Dybenko was just coming out, giving rapid orders right and left. Inhis hand he carried the big revolver. An automobile stood withracing engine at the kerb. Alone, he climbed in the rear seat, andwas off-off to Gatchina, to conquer Kerensky.Toward nightfall he arrived at the outskirts of the town, and wenton afoot. What Dybenko told the Cossacks nobody knows, but the factis that General Krasnov and his staff and several thousand Cossackssurrendered, and advised Kerensky to do the same. (See App. IX,Sect. 5)As for Kerensky-I reprint here the deposition made by GeneralKrasnov on the morning of November 14th:"Gatchina, November 14, 1917. To-day, about three o'clock (A. M.), Iwas summoned by the Supreme Commander (Kerensky). He was veryagitated, and very nervous."'General,' he said to me, 'you have betrayed me. Your Cossacksdeclare categorically that they will arrest me and deliver me to thesailors.'"'Yes,' I answered, 'there is talk of it, and I know that you haveno sympathy anywhere.'"'But the officers say the same thing.'"'Yes, most of all it is the officers who are discontented with you.'"'What shall I do? I ought to commit suicide!'"'If you are an honorable man, you will go immediately to Petrogradwith a white flag, you will present yourself to the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee, and enter into negotiations as Chief of theProvisional Government.'"'All right. I will do that, General.'"'I will give you a guard and ask that a sailor go with you.'"'No, no, not a sailor. Do you know whether it is true that Dybenkois here?'"'I don't know who Dybenko is.'"'He is my enemy."'There is nothing to do. If you play for high stakes you must knowhow to take a chance.'"'Yes. I'll leave to-night!'"'Why? That would be a flight. Leave calmly and openly, so thatevery one can see that you are not running away.'"'Very well. But you must give me a guard on which I can count.'"'Good.'"I went out and called the Cossack Russkov, of the Tenth Regiment ofthe Don, and ordered him to pick out ten Cossacks to accompany theSupreme Commander. Half an hour later the Cossacks came to tell methat Kerensky was not in his quarters, that he had run away."I gave the alarm and ordered that he be searched for, supposingthat he could not have left Gatchina, but he could not be found...."And so Kerensky fled, alone, "disguised in the uniform of a sailor,"and by that act lost whatever popularity he had retained among theRussian masses....I went back to Petrograd riding on the front seat of an auto truck,driven by a workman and filled with Red Guards. We had no kerosene,so our lights were not burning. The road was crowded with theproletarian army going home, and new reserves pouring out to taketheir places. Immense trucks like ours, columns of artillery,wagons, loomed up in the night, without lights, as we were. Wehurtled furiously on, wrenched right and left to avoid collisionsthat seemed inevitable, scraping wheels, followed by the epithets ofpedestrians.Across the horizon spread the glittering lights of the capital,immeasurably more splendid by night than by day, like a dike ofjewels heaped on the barren plain.The old workman who drove held the wheel in one hand, while with theother he swept the far-gleaming capital in an exultant gesture."Mine!" he cried, his face all alight. "All mine now! My Petrograd!"                              Chapter X                                MoscowThe Military Revolutionary Committee, with a fierce intensity,followed up its victory:November 14th.To all Army, corps, divisional and regimental Committees, to allSoviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, to all, all,all.Conforming to the agreement between the Cossacks, _yunkers,_soldiers, sailors and workers, it has been decided to arraignAlexander Feodorvitch Kerensky before a tribunal of the people. Wedemand that Kerensky be arrested, and that he be ordered, in the nameof the organisations hereinafter mentioned, to come immediately toPetrograd and present himself to the tribunal.Signed,_The Cossacks of the First Division of Ussuri Cavalry; the Committeeof Yunkers of the Petrograd detachment of Franc-Tireurs; the delegateof the Fifth Army._People's Commissar DYBENKO.The Committee for Salvation, the Duma, the Central Committee of theSocialist Revolutionary party-proudly claiming Kerensky as amember-all passionately protested that he could only be heldresponsible to the Constituent Assembly.On the evening of November 16th I watched two thousand Red Guardsswing down the Zagorodny Prospekt behind a military band playing the_Marseillaise_-and how appropriate it sounded-with blood-red flagsover the dark ranks of workmen, to welcome home again their brotherswho had defended "Red Petrograd." In the bitter dusk they tramped,men and women, their tall bayonets swaying; through streets faintlylighted and slippery with mud, between silent crowds of bourgeois,contemptuous but fearful....All were against them-business men, speculators, investors,land-owners, army officers, politicians, teachers, students,professional men, shop-keepers, clerks, agents. The other Socialistparties hated the Bolsheviki with an implacable hatred. On the sideof the Soviets were the rank and file of the workers, the sailors,all the undemoralised soldiers, the landless peasants, and a few-avery few-intellectuals....From the farthest corners of great Russia, whereupon desperatestreet-fighting burst like a wave, news of Kerensky's defeat cameechoing back the immense roar of proletarian victory. Kazan, Saratov,Novgorod, Vinnitza-where the streets had run with blood; Moscow,where the Bolsheviki had turned their artillery against the laststrong-hold of the bourgeoisie-the Kremlin."They are bombarding the Kremlin!" The news passed from mouth tomouth in the streets of Petrograd, almost with a sense of terror.Travellers from "white and shining little mother Moscow" told fearfultales. Thousands killed; the Tverskaya and the Kuznetsky Most inflames; the church of Vasili Blazheiny a smoking ruin; UsspenskyCathedral crumbling down; the Spasskaya Gate of the Kremlintottering; the Duma burned to the ground. (See App. X, Sect. 1)Nothing that the Bolsheviki had done could compare with this fearfulblasphemy in the heart of Holy Russia. To the ears of the devoutsounded the shock of guns crashing in the face of the Holy OrthodoxChurch, and pounding to dust the sanctuary of the Russian nation....On November 15th, Lunatcharsky, Commissar of Education, broke intotears at the session of the Council of People's Commissars, andrushed from the room, crying, "I cannot stand it! I cannot bear themonstrous destruction of beauty and tradition...."That afternoon his letter of resignation was published in thenewspapers:I have just been informed, by people arriving from Moscow, what hashappened there.The Cathedral of St. Basil the Blessed, the Cathedral of theAssumption, are being bombarded. The Kremlin, where are now gatheredthe most important art treasures of Petrograd and of Moscow, is underartillery fire. There are thousands of victims.The fearful struggle there has reached a pitch of bestial ferocity.What is left? What more can happen?I cannot bear this. My cup is full. I am unable to endure thesehorrors. It is impossible to work under the pressure of thoughtswhich drive me mad!That is why I am leaving the Council of People's Commissars.I fully realise the gravity of this decision. But I can bear nomore.... (See App. X, Sect. 2)That same day the White Guards and _yunkers_ in the Kremlinsurrendered, and were allowed to march out unharmed. The treaty ofpeace follows:1. The Committee of Public Safety ceases to exist.2. The White Guard gives up its arms and dissolves. The officersretain their swords and regulations side-arms. In the MilitarySchools are retained only the arms necessary for instruction; allothers are surrendered by the _yunkers._ The Military RevolutionaryCommittee guarantees the liberty and inviolability of the person.3. To settle the question of disarmament, as set forth in section 2,a special commission is appointed, consisting of representatives fromall organisations which took part in the peace negotiations.4. From the moment of the signature of this peace treaty, bothparties shall immediately give order to cease firing and halt allmilitary operations, taking measures to ensure punctual obedience tothis order.5. At the signature of the treaty, all prisoners made by the twoparties shall be released....For two days now the Bolsheviki had been in control of the city. Thefrightened citizens were creeping out of their cellars to seek theirdead; the barricades in the streets were being removed. Instead ofdiminishing, however, the stories of destruction in Moscow continuedto grow.... And it was under the influence of these fearful reportsthat we decided to go there.Petrograd, after all, in spite of being for a century the seat ofGovernment, is still an artificial city. Moscow is real Russia,Russia as it was and will be; in Moscow we would get the true feelingof the Russian people about the Revolution. Life was more intensethere.For the past week the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee,aided by the rank and file of the Railway Workers, had seized controlof the Nicolai Railroad, and hurled trainload after trainload ofsailors and Red Guards southwest.... We were provided with passes fromSmolny, without which no one could leave the capital.... When the trainbacked into the station, a mob of shabby soldiers, all carrying hugesacks of eatables, stormed the doors, smashed the windows, and pouredinto all the compartments, filling up the aisles and even climbingonto the roof. Three of us managed to wedge our way into acompartment, but almost immediately about twenty soldiers entered....There was room for only four people; we argued, expostulated, and theconductor joined us-but the soldiers merely laughed. Were they tobother about the comfort of a lot of _boorzhui_ (bourgeois)? Weproduced the passes from Smolny; instantly the soldiers changed theirattitude."Come, comrades," cried one, "these are American _tovarishtchi._ Theyhave come thirty thousand versts to see our Revolution, and they arenaturally tired...."With polite and friendly apologies the soldiers began to leave.Shortly afterward we heard them breaking into a compartment occupiedby two stout, well-dressed Russians, who had bribed the conductor andlocked their door....About seven o'clock in the evening we drew out of the station, animmense long train drawn by a weak little locomotive burning wood,and stumbled along slowly, with many stops. The soldiers on the roofkicked with their heels and sang whining peasant songs; and in thecorridor, so jammed that it was impossible to pass, violent politicaldebates raged all night long. Occasionally the conductor camethrough, as a matter of habit, looking for tickets. He found very fewexcept ours, and after a half-hour of futile wrangling, lifted hisarms despairingly and withdrew. The atmosphere was stifling, full ofsmoke and foul odours; if it hadn't been for the broken windows wewould doubtless have smothered during the night.In the morning, hours late, we looked out upon a snowy world. It wasbitter cold. About noon a peasant woman got on with a basket-full ofbread-chunks and a great can of luke warm coffee-substitute. Fromthen on until dark there was nothing but the packed train, joltingand stopping, and occasional stations where a ravenous mob swoopeddown on the scantily-furnished buffet and swept it clean.... At one ofthese halts I ran into Nogin and Rykov, the seceding Commissars, whowere returning to Moscow to put their grievances before their ownSoviet,  1and further along was Bukharin, a short, red-bearded manwith the eyes of a fanatic-"more Left than Lenin," they said of him....Then the three strokes of the bell and we made a rush for the train,worming our way through the packed and noisy aisle.... A good-naturedcrowd, bearing the discomfort with humorous patience, interminablyarguing about everything from the situation in Petrograd to theBritish Trade-Union system, and disputing loudly with the few_boorzhui_ who were on board. Before we reached Moscow almost everycar had organised a Committee to secure and distribute food, andthese Committees became divided into political factions, who wrangledover fundamental principles....The station at Moscow was deserted. We went to the office of theCommissar, in order to arrange for our return tickets. He was asullen youth with the shoulder-straps of a Lieutenant; when we showedhim our papers from Smolny, he lost his temper and declared that hewas no Bolshevik, that he represented the Committee of PublicSafety.... It was characteristic-in the general turmoil attending theconquest of the city, the chief railway station had been forgotten bythe victors....Not a cab in sight. A few blocks down the street, however, we woke upa grotesquely-padded _izvostchik_ asleep upright on the box of hislittle sleigh. "How much to the centre of the town?"He scratched his head. "The _barini_ won't be able to find a room inany hotel," he said. "But I'll take you around for a hundredrubles...." Before the Revolution it cost _two!_ We objected, but hesimply shrugged his shoulders. "It takes a good deal of courage todrive a sleigh nowadays," he went on. We could not beat him downbelow fifty.... As we sped along the silent, snowy half-lightedstreets, he recounted his adventures during the six days' fighting."Driving along, or waiting for a fare on the corner," he said, "allof a sudden _pooff!_ a cannon ball exploding here, _pooff!_ a cannonball there, _ratt-ratt!_ a machine-gun.... I gallop, the devilsshooting all around. I get to a nice quiet street and stop, doze alittle, _pooff!_ another cannon ball, _ratt-ratt_.... Devils! Devils!Devils! Brrr!"In the centre of the town the snow-piled streets were quiet with thestillness of convalescence. Only a few arc-lights were burning, onlya few pedestrians hurried along the side-walks. An icy wind blew fromthe great plain, cutting to the bone. At the first hotel we enteredan office illuminated by two candles."Yes, we have some very comfortable rooms, but all the windows areshot out. If the _gospodin_ does not mind a little fresh air...."Down the Tverskaya the shop-windows were broken, and there wereshell-holes and torn-up paving stones in the street. Hotel afterhotel, all full, or the proprietors still so frightened that all theycould say was, "No, no, there is no room! There is no room!" On themain streets, where the great banking-houses and mercantile houseslay, the Bolshevik artillery had been indiscriminately effective. Asone Soviet official told me, "Whenever we didn't know just where the_yunkers_ and White Guards were, we bombarded their pocketbooks...."At the big Hotel National they finally took us in; for we wereforeigners, and the Military Revolutionary Committee had promised toprotect the dwellings of foreigners.... On the top floor the managershowed us where shrapnel had shattered several windows. "Theanimals!" said he, shaking his first at imaginary Bolsheviki. "Butwait! Their time will come; in just a few days now their ridiculousGovernment will fall, and then we shall make them suffer!"We dined at a vegetarian restaurant with the enticing name, "I EatNobody," and Tolstoy's picture prominent on the walls, and thensallied out into the streets.The headquarters of the Moscow Soviet was in the palace of the formerGovernor-General, an imposing white building fronting SkobelievSquare. Red Guards stood sentry at the door. At the head of the wide,formal stairway, whose walls were plastered with announcements ofcommittee-meetings and addresses of political parties, we passedthrough a series of lofty ante-rooms, hung with red-shrouded picturesin gold frames, to the splendid state salon, with its magnificentcrystal lustres and gilded cornices. A low-voiced hum of talk,underlaid with the whirring bass of a score of sewing machines,filled the place. Huge bolts of red and black cotton cloth wereunrolled, serpentining across the parqueted floor and over tables, atwhich sat half a hundred women, cutting and sewing streamers andbanners for the Funeral of the Revolutionary Dead. The faces of thesewomen were roughened and scarred with life at its most difficult;they worked now sternly, many of them with eyes red from weeping....The losses of the Red Army had been heavy.At a desk in one corner was Rogov, an intelligent, bearded man withglasses, wearing the black blouse of a worker. He invited us to marchwith the Central Executive Committee in the funeral procession nextmorning...."It is impossible to teach the Socialist Revolutionaries and theMensheviki anything!" he exclaimed. "They compromise from sheerhabit. Imagine! They proposed that we hold a joint funeral with the_yunkers!"_[Graphic page-251 Questionairre for the Bourgeoioisie]Distributed to all bourgeois households in Moscow by the MoscowMilitary Revolutionary Commitee, so as to provide a basis for therequisition of clothing for the Army and the poor workers. Fortranslation see Appendix 3. (See App. X, Sect. 3)Across the hall came a man in a ragged soldier-coat and _shapka,_whose face was familiar; I recognised Melnichansky, whom I had knownas the watch-maker George Melcher in Bayonne, New Jersey, during thegreat Standard Oil strike. Now, he told me, he was secretary of theMoscow Metal-Workers' Union, and a Commissar of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee during the fighting...."You see me!" he cried, showing his decrepit clothing. "I was withthe boys in the Kremlin when the _yunkers_ came the first time. Theyshut me up in the cellar and swiped my overcoat, my money, watch andeven the ring on my finger. This is all I've got to wear!"From him I learned many details of the bloody six-day battle whichhad rent Moscow in two. Unlike in Petrograd, in Moscow the City Dumahad taken command of the _yunkers_ and White Guards. Rudnev, theMayor, and Minor, president of the Duma, had directed the activitiesof the Committee of Public Safety and the troops. Riabtsev,Commandant of the city, a man of democratic instincts, had hesitatedabout opposing the Military Revolutionary Committee; but the Duma hadforced him.... It was the Mayor who had urged the occupation of theKremlin; "They will never dare fire on you there," he said....One garrison regiment, badly demoralised by long inactivity, had beenapproached by both sides. The regiment held a meeting to decide whataction to take. Resolved, that the regiment remain neutral, andcontinue its present activities-which consisted in peddling rubbersand sunflower seeds!"But worst of all," said Melnichansky, "we had to organise while wewere fighting. The other side knew just what it wanted; but here thesoldiers had their Soviet and the workers theirs.... There was afearful wrangle over who should be Commander-in-chief; some regimentstalked for days before they decided what to do; and when the officerssuddenly deserted us, we had no battle-staff to give orders...."Vivid little pictures he gave me. On a cold grey day he had stood ata corner of the Nikitskaya, which was swept by blasts of machine-gunfire. A throng of little boys were gathered there-street waifs whoused to be newsboys. Shrill, excited as if with a new game, theywaited until the firing slackened, and then tried to run across thestreet.... Many were killed, but the rest dashed backward and forward,laughing, daring each other....Late in the evening I went to the _Dvorianskoye Sobranie_-the Nobles'Club-where the Moscow Bolsheviki were to meet and consider the reportof Nogin, Rykov and the others who had left the Council of People'sCommissars.The meeting-place was a theatre, in which, under the old régime, toaudiences of officers and glittering ladies, amateur presentations ofthe latest French comedy had once taken place.At first the place filled with the intellectuals-those who lived nearthe centre of the town. Nogin spoke, and most of his listeners wereplainly with him. It was very late before the workers arrived; theworking-class quarters were on the outskirts of the town, and nostreet-cars were running. But about midnight they began to clump upthe stairs, in groups of ten or twenty-big, rough men, in coarseclothes, fresh from the battle-line, where they had fought likedevils for a week, seeing their comrades fall all about them.Scarcely had the meeting formally opened before Nogin was assailedwith a tempest of jeers and angry shouts. In vain he tried to argue,to explain; they would not listen. He had left the Council ofPeople's Commissars; he had deserted his post while the battle wasraging. As for the bourgeois press, here in Moscow there was no morebourgeois press; even the City Duma had been dissolved. (See App. X,Sect. 4) Bukharin stood up, savage, logical, with a voice whichplunged and struck, plunged and struck.... Him they listened to withshining eyes. Resolution, to support the action of the Council ofPeople's Commissars, passed by overwhelming majority. So spokeMoscow....[Graphic page-254 Pass to the Kremlin]By this the Military Revolutionary Commitee requests to give a passfor the purpose of investigating the Kremlin, the representatives ofthe American Socialist party attached to the Socialist press,comrades Reed and Bryant.              Chief of the Military Revolutionary Committee                              For the SecretaryLate in the night we went through the empty streets and under theIberian Gate to the great Red Square in front of the Kremlin. Thechurch of Vasili Blazheiny loomed fantastic, its bright-coloured,convoluted and blazoned cupolas vague in the darkness. There was nosign of any damage.... Along one side of the square the dark towers andwalls of the Kremlin stood up. On the high walls flickered redly thelight of hidden flames; voices reached us across the immense place,and the sound of picks and shovels. We crossed over.Mountains of dirt and rock were piled high near the base of the wall.Climbing these we looked down into two massive pits, ten or fifteenfeet deep and fifty yards long, where hundreds of soldiers andworkers were digging in the light of huge fires.A young student spoke to us in German. "The Brotherhood Grave," heexplained. "To-morrow we shall bury here five hundred proletarianswho died for the Revolution."He took us down into the pit. In frantic haste swung the picks andshovels, and the earth-mountains grew. No one spoke. Overhead thenight was thick with stars, and the ancient Imperial Kremlin walltowered up immeasurably."Here in this holy place," said the student, "holiest of all Russia,we shall bury our most holy. Here where are the tombs of the Tsars,our Tsar-the People-shall sleep...." His arm was in a sling, from abullet-wound gained in the fighting. He looked at it. "You foreignerslook down on us Russians because so long we tolerated a mediævalmonarchy," said he. "But we saw that the Tsar was not the only tyrantin the world; capitalism was worse, and in all the countries of theworld capitalism was Emperor.... Russian revolutionary tactics arebest...."As we left, the workers in the pit, exhausted and running with sweatin spite of the cold, began to climb wearily out. Across the RedSquare a dark knot of men came hurrying. They swarmed into the pits,picked up the tools and began digging, digging, without a word....So, all the long night volunteers of the People relieved each other,never halting in their driving speed, and the cold light of the dawnlaid bare the great Square, white with snow, and the yawning brownpits of the Brotherhood Grave, quite finished.We rose before sunrise, and hurried through the dark streets toSkobeliev Square. In all the great city not a human being could beseen; but there was a faint sound of stirring, far and near, like adeep wind coming. In the pale half-light a little group of men andwomen were gathered before the Soviet headquarters, with a sheaf ofgold-lettered red banners-the Central Executive Committee of theMoscow Soviets. It grew light. From afar the vague stirring sounddeepened and became louder, a steady and tremendous bass. The citywas rising. We set out down the Tverskaya, the banners flappingoverhead. The little street chapels along our way were locked anddark, as was the Chapel of the Iberian Virgin, which each new Tsarused to visit before he went to the Kremlin to crown himself, andwhich, day or night, was always open and crowded, and brilliant withthe candles of the devout gleaming on the gold and silver and jewelsof the ikons. Now, for the first time since Napoleon was in Moscow,they say, the candles were out.The Holy Orthodox Church had withdrawn the light of its countenancefrom Moscow, the nest of irreverent vipers who had bombarded theKremlin. Dark and silent and cold were the churches; the priests haddisappeared. There were no popes to officiate at the Red Burial,there had been no sacrament for the dead, nor were any prayers to besaid over the grave of the blasphemers. Tikhon, Metropolitan ofMoscow, was soon to excommunicate the Soviets....Also the shops were closed, and the propertied classes stayed athome-but for other reasons. This was the Day of the People, therumour of whose coming was thunderous as surf....Already through the Iberian Gate a human river was flowing, and thevast Red Square was spotted with people, thousands of them. Iremarked that as the throng passed the Iberian Chapel, where alwaysbefore the passerby had crossed himself, they did not seem to noticeit....We forced our way through the dense mass packed near the Kremlinwall, and stood upon one of the dirt-mountains. Already several menwere there, among them Muranov, the soldier who had been electedCommandant of Moscow-a tall, simple-looking, bearded man with agentle face.Through all the streets to the Red Square the torrents of peoplepoured, thousands upon thousands of them, all with the look of thepoor and the toiling. A military band came marching up, playing the_Internationale,_ and spontaneously the song caught and spread likewind-ripples on a sea, slow and solemn. From the top of the Kremlinwall gigantic banners unrolled to the ground; red, with great lettersin gold and in white, saying, "Martyrs of the Beginning of WorldSocial Revolution," and "Long Live the Brotherhood of Workers of theWorld."A bitter wind swept the Square, lifting the banners. Now from the farquarters of the city the workers of the different factories werearriving, with their dead. They could be seen coming through theGate, the blare of their banners, and the dull red-like blood-of thecoffins they carried. These were rude boxes, made of unplaned woodand daubed with crimson, borne high on the shoulders of rough men whomarched with tears streaming down their faces, and followed by womenwho sobbed and screamed, or walked stiffly, with white, dead faces.Some of the coffins were open, the lid carried behind them; otherswere covered with gilded or silvered cloth, or had a soldier's hatnailed on the top. There were many wreaths of hideous artificialflowers....Through an irregular lane that opened and closed again the processionslowly moved toward us. Now through the Gate was flowing an endlessstream of banners, all shades of red, with silver and gold lettering,knots of crepe hanging from the top-and some Anarchist flags, blackwith white letters. The band was playing the Revolutionary FuneralMarch, and against the immense singing of the mass of people,standing uncovered, the paraders sang hoarsely, choked with sobs....Between the factory-workers came companies of soldiers with theircoffins, too, and squadrons of cavalry, riding at salute, andartillery batteries, the cannon wound with red and black-forever, itseemed. Their banners said, "Long live the Third International!" or"We Want an Honest, General, Democratic Peace!"Slowly the marchers came with their coffins to the entrance of thegrave, and the bearers clambered up with their burdens and went downinto the pit. Many of them were women-squat, strong proletarianwomen. Behind the dead came other women-women young and broken, orold, wrinkled women making noises like hurt animals, who tried tofollow their sons and husbands into the Brotherhood Grave, andshrieked when compassionate hands restrained them. The poor love eachother so!All the long day the funeral procession passed, coming in by theIberian Gate and leaving the Square by way of the Nikolskaya, a riverof red banners, bearing words of hope and brotherhood and stupendousprophecies, against a back-ground of fifty thousand people,-under theeyes of the world's workers and their descendants forever....One by one the five hundred coffins were laid in the pits. Dusk fell,and still the banners came drooping and fluttering, the band playedthe Funeral March, and the huge assemblage chanted. In the leaflessbranches of the trees above the grave the wreaths were hung, likestrange, multi-coloured blossoms. Two hundred men began to shovel inthe dirt. It rained dully down upon the coffins with a thuddingsound, audible beneath the singing....The lights came out. The last banners passed, and the last moaningwomen, looking back with awful intensity as they went. Slowly fromthe great Square ebbed the proletarian tide....I suddenly realised that the devout Russian people no longer neededpriests to pray them into heaven. On earth they were building akingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer, and for which itwas a glory to die....                              Chapter XI                The Conquest of Power (See App. XI, Sect. 1)DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA (See App. XI,Sect. 2)... The first Congress of Soviets, in June of this year, proclaimedthe right of the peoples of Russia to self-determination.The second Congress of Soviets, in November last, confirmed thisinalienable right of the peoples of Russia more decisively anddefinitely.Executing the will of these Congresses, the Council of People'sCommissars has resolved to establish as a basis for its activity inthe question of Nationalities, the following principles:(1) The equality and sovereignty of the peoples of Russia.(2) The right of the peoples of Russia to free self-determination,even to the point of separation and the formation of an independentstate.(3) The abolition of any and all national and national religiousprivileges and disabilities.(4) The free development of national minorities and ethnographicgroups inhabiting the territory of Russia.Decrees will be prepared immediately upon the formation of aCommission on Nationalities.In the name of the Russian Republic,People's Commissar for NationalitiesYUSSOV DJUGASHVILI-STALINPresident of the Council of People's CommissarsV. ULIANOV (LENIN)The Central Rada at Kiev immediately declared Ukraine an independentRepublic, as did the Government of Finland, through the Senate atHelsingfors. Independent "Governments" spring up in Siberia and theCaucasus. The Polish Chief Military Committee swiftly gatheredtogether the Polish troops in the Russian army, abolished theirCommittees and established an iron discipline....All these "Governments" and "movements" had two characteristics incommon; they were controlled by the propertied classes, and theyfeared and detested Bolshevism....Steadily, amid the chaos of shocking change, the Council of People'sCommissars hammered at the scaffolding of the Socialist order.Decree on Social Insurance, on Workers' Control, Regulations forVolost Land Committees, Abolition of Ranks and Titles, Abolition ofCourts and the Creation of People's Tribunals.... (See App. XI, Sect.3)Army after army, fleet after fleet, sent deputations, "joyfully togreet the new Government of the People."In front of Smolny, one day, I saw a ragged regiment just come fromthe trenches. The soldiers were drawn up before the great gates,thin and grey-faced, looking up at the building as if God were init. Some pointed out the Imperial eagles over the door, laughing....Red Guards came to mount guard. All the soldiers turned to look,curiously, as if they had heard of them but never seen them. Theylaughed good-naturedly and pressed out of line to slap the RedGuards on the back, with half-joking, half-admiring remarks....The Provisional Government was no more. On November 15th, in all thechurches of the capital, the priests stopped praying for it. But asLenin himself told the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ that was "only the beginningof the conquest of power." Deprived of arms, the opposition, whichstill controlled the economic life of the country, settled down toorganise disorganisation, with all the Russian genius forcooperative action-to obstruct, cripple and discredit the Soviets.The strike of Government employees was well organised, financed bythe banks and commercial establishments. Every move of theBolsheviki to take over the Government apparatus was resisted.Trotzky went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the functionariesrefused to recognise him, locked themselves in, and when the doorswere forced, resigned. He demanded the keys of the archives; onlywhen he brought workmen to force the locks were they given up. Thenit was discovered that Neratov, former assistant Foreign Minister,had disappeared with the Secret Treaties....Shliapnikov tried to take possession of the Ministry of Labour. Itwas bitterly cold, and there was no one to light the fires. Of allthe hundreds of employees, not one would show him where the officeof the Minister was....Alexandra Kollontai, appointed the 13th of November Commissar ofPublic Welfare-the department of charities and publicinstitutions-was welcomed with a strike of all but forty of thefunctionaries in the Ministry. Immediately the poor of the greatcities, the inmates of institutions, were plunged in miserable want:delegations of starving cripples, of orphans with blue, pinchedfaces, besieged the building. With tears streaming down her face,Kollontai arrested the strikers until they should deliver the keysof the office and the safe; when she got the keys, however, it wasdiscovered that the former Minister, Countess Panina, had gone offwith all the funds, which she refused to surrender except on theorder of the Constituent Assembly. (See App. XI, Sect. 4)In the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Supplies, theMinistry of Finance, similar incidents occurred. And the employees,summoned to return or forfeit their positions and their pensions,either stayed away or returned to sabotage.... Almost all the_intelligentzia_ being anti-Bolshevik, there was nowhere for theSoviet Government to recruit new staffs....The private banks remained stubbornly closed, with a back door openfor speculators. When Bolshevik Commissars entered, the clerks left,secreting the books and removing the funds. All the employees of theState Bank struck except the clerks in charge of the vaults and themanufacture of money, who refused all demands from Smolny andprivately paid out huge sums to the Committee for Salvation and theCity Duma.Twice a Commissar, with a company of Red Guards, came formally toinsist upon the delivery of large sums for Government expenses. Thefirst time, the City Duma members and the Menshevik and SocialistRevolutionary leaders were present in imposing numbers, and spoke sogravely of the consequences that the Commissar was frightened. Thesecond time he arrived with a warrant, which he proceeded to readaloud in due form; but some one called his attention to the factthat it had no date and no seal, and the traditional Russian respectfor "documents" forced him again to withdraw....The officials of the Credit Chancery destroyed their books, so thatall record of the financial relations of Russia with foreigncountries was lost.The Supply Committees, the administrations of the Municipal-ownedpublic utilities, either did not work at all, or sabotaged. And whenthe Bolsheviki, compelled by the desperate needs of the citypopulation, attempted to help or to control the public service, allthe employees went on strike immediately, and the Duma floodedRussia with telegrams about Bolshevik "violation of Municipalautonomy."At Military headquarters, and in the offices of the Ministries ofWar and Marine, where the old officials had consented to work, theArmy Committees and the high command blocked the Soviets in everyway possible, even to the extent of neglecting the troops at thefront. The _Vikzhel_ was hostile, refusing to transport Soviettroops; every troop-train that left Petrograd was taken out byforce, and railway officials had to be arrested each time-whereuponthe _Vikzhel_ threatened an immediate general strike unless theywere released....Smolny was plainly powerless. The newspapers said that all thefactories of Petrograd must shut down for lack of fuel in threeweeks; the _Vikzhel_ announced that trains must cease running byDecember first; there was food for three days only in Petrograd, andno more coming in; and the Army on the Front was starving.... TheCommittee for Salvation, the various Central Committees, sent wordall over the country, exhorting the population to ignore theGovernment decrees. And the Allied Embassies were either coldlyindifferent, or openly hostile....The opposition newspapers, suppressed one day and reappearing nextmorning under new names, heaped bitter sarcasm on the new regime.(See App. XI, Sect. 5) Even _Novaya Zhizn_ characterised it as "acombination of demagoguery and impotence."From day to day (it said) the Government of the People's Commissarssinks deeper and deeper into the mire of superficial haste. Havingeasily conquered the power... the Bolsheviki can not make use of it.Powerless to direct the existing mechanism of Government, they areunable at the same time to create a new one which might work easilyand freely according to the theories of social experimenters.Just a little while ago the Bolsheviki hadn't enough men to runtheir growing party-a work above all of speakers and writers; wherethen are they going to find trained men to execute the diverse andcomplicated functions of government?The new Government acts and threatens, it sprays the country withdecrees, each one more radical and more "socialist" than the last.But in this exhibition of Socialism on Paper-more likely designedfor the stupefaction of our descendants-there appears neither thedesire nor the capacity to solve the immediate problems of the day!Meanwhile the _Vikzhel's_ Conference to Form a New Governmentcontinued to meet night and day. Both sides had already agreed inprinciple to the basis of the Government; the composition of thePeople's Council was being discussed; the Cabinet was tentativelychosen, with Tchernov as Premier; the Bolsheviki were admitted in alarge minority, but Lenin and Trotzky were barred. The CentralCommittees of the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary parties, theExecutive Committee of the Peasant's Soviets, resolved that,although unalterably opposed to the "criminal politics" of theBolsheviki, they would, "in order to halt the fratricidalbloodshed," not oppose their entrance into the People's Council.The flight of Kerensky, however, and the astounding success of theSoviets everywhere, altered the situation. On the 16th, in a meetingof the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the Left Socialist Revolutionaries insistedthat the Bolsheviki should form a coalition Government with theother Socialist parties; otherwise they would withdraw from theMilitary Revolutionary Committee and the _Tsay-ee-kah._ Malkin said,"The news from Moscow, where our comrades are dying on both sides ofthe barricades, determines us to bring up once more the question oforganisation of power, and it is not only our right to do so, butour duty.... We have won the right to sit with the Bolsheviki herewithin the walls of Smolny Institute, and to speak from thistribune. After the bitter internal party struggle, we shall beobliged, if you refuse to compromise, to pass to open battleoutside.... We must propose to the democracy terms of an acceptablecompromise...."After a recess to consider this ultimatum, the Bolsheviki returnedwith a resolution, read by Kameniev:The _Tsay-ee-kah_ considers it necessary that there enter into theGovernment representatives of _all the Socialist parties composingthe Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies whorecognise the conquests of the Revolution of November 7th-that is tosay, the establishment of a Government of Soviets, the decrees onpeace, land, workers' control over industry, and the arming of theworking-class._ The _Tsay-ee-kah_ therefore resolves to proposenegotiations concerning the constitution of the Government to allparties _of the Soviet,_ and insists upon the following conditionsas a basis:The Government is responsible to the _Tsay-ee-kah._ The_Tsay-ee-kah_ shall be enlarged to 150 members. To these 150delegates of the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies shall beadded 75 delegates of the _Provincial_ Soviets of Peasants'Deputies, 80 from the Front organisations of the Army and Navy, 40from the Trade Unions (25 from the various All-Russian Unions, inproportion to their importance, 10 from the _Vikzhel,_ and 5 fromthe Post and Telegraph Workers), and 50 delegates from the Socialistgroups in the Petrograd City Duma. In the Ministry itself, at leastone-half the portfolios must be reserved to the Bolsheviki. TheMinistries of Labour, Interior and Foreign Affairs must be given tothe Bolsheviki. The command of the garrisons of Petrograd and Moscowmust remain in the hands of delegates of the Moscow and PetrogradSoviets.The Government undertakes the systematic arming of the workers ofall Russia.It is resolved to insist upon the candidature of comrades Lenin andTrotzky.Kameniev explained. "The so-called 'People's Council,'" he said,"proposed by the Conference, would consist of about 420 members, ofwhich about 150 would be Bolsheviki. Besides, there would bedelegates from the counter-revolutionary old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ 100members chosen by the Municipal Dumas-Kornilovtsi all; 100 delegatesfrom the Peasants' Soviets-appointed by Avksentiev, and 80 from theold Army Committees, who no longer represent the soldier masses."We refuse to admit the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and also therepresentatives of the Municipal Dumas. The delegates from thePeasants' Soviets shall be elected by the Congress of Peasants,which we have called, and which will at the same time elect a newExecutive Committee. The proposal to exclude Lenin and Trotzky is aproposal to decapitate our party, and we do not accept it. Andfinally, we see no necessity for a 'People's Council' anyway; theSoviets are open to all Socialist parties, and the _Tsay-ee-kah_represents them in their real proportions among the masses...."Karelin, for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, declared that hisparty would vote for the Bolshevik resolution, reserving the rightto modify certain details, such as the representation of thepeasants, and demanding that the Ministry of Agriculture be reservedfor the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. This was agreed to....Later, at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, Trotzky answered aquestion about the formation of the new Government:"I don't know anything about that. I am not taking part in thenegotiations.... However, I don't think that they are of greatimportance...."That night there was great uneasiness in the Conference. Thedelegates of the City Duma withdrew....But at Smolny itself, in the ranks of the Bolshevik party, aformidable opposition to Lenin's policy was growing. On the night ofNovember 17th the great hall was packed and ominous for the meetingof the _Tsay-ee-kah._Larin, Bolshevik, declared that the moment of elections to theConstituent Assembly approached, and it was time to do away with"political terrorism.""The measures taken against the freedom of the press should bemodified. They had their reason during the struggle, but now theyhave no further excuse. The press should be free, except for appealsto riot and insurrection."In a storm of hisses and hoots from his own party, Larin offered thefollowing resolution:The decree of the Council of People's Commissars concerning thePress is herewith repealed.Measures of political repression can only be employed subject todecision of a special tribunal, elected by the _Tsay-ee-kah_proportionally to the strength of the different parties represented;and this tribunal shall have the right also to reconsider measuresof repression already taken.This was met by a thunder of applause, not only from the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries, but also from a part of the Bolsheviki.Avanessov, for the Leninites, hastily proposed that the question ofthe Press be postponed until after some compromise between theSocialist parties had been reached. Overwhelmingly voted down."The revolution which is now being accomplished," went on Avanessov,"has not hesitated to attack private property; and it is as privateproperty that we must examine the question of the Press...."Thereupon he read the official Bolshevik resolution:The suppression of the bourgeois press was dictated not only bypurely military needs in the course of the insurrection, and for thechecking of counter-revolutionary action, but it is also necessaryas a measure of transition toward the establishment of a new régimewith regard to the Press-a régime under which the capitalist ownersof printing-presses and of paper cannot be the all-powerful andexclusive manufacturers of public opinion.We must further proceed to the confiscation of private printingplants and supplies of paper, which should become the property ofthe Soviets, both in the capital and in the provinces, so that thepolitical parties and groups can make use of the facilities ofprinting in proportion to the actual strength of the ideas theyrepresent-in other words, proportionally to the number of theirconstituents.The reëstablishment of the so-called "freedom of the press," thesimple return of printing presses and paper to thecapitalists,-poisoners of the mind of the people-this would be aninadmissible surrender to the will of capital, a giving up of one ofthe most important conquests of the Revolution; in other words, itwould be a measure of unquestionably counter-revolutionary character.Proceeding from the above, the _Tsay-ee-kah_ categorically rejectsall propositions aiming at the reëstablishment of the old régime inthe domain of the Press, and unequivocally supports the point ofview of the Council of People's Commissars on this question, againstpretentions and ultimatums dictated by petty bourgeois prejudices,or by evident surrender to the interests of thecounter-revolutionary bourgeoisie.The reading of this resolution was interrupted by ironical shoutsfrom the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, and bursts of indignationfrom the insurgent Bolsheviki. Karelin was on his feet, protesting."Three weeks ago the Bolsheviki were the most ardent defenders ofthe freedom of the Press... The arguments in this resolution suggestsingularly the point of view of the old Black Hundreds and thecensors of the Tsarist régime-for they also talked of 'poisoners ofthe mind of the people.'"Trotzky spoke at length in favour of the resolution. Hedistinguished between the Press during the civil war, and the Pressafter the victory. "During civil war the right to use violencebelongs only to the oppressed...." (Cries of "Who's the oppressed now?Cannibal!")."The victory over our adversaries is not yet achieved, and thenewspapers are arms in their hands. In these conditions, the closingof the newspapers is a legitimate measure of defence...." Then passingto the question of the Press after the victory, Trotzky continued:"The attitude of Socialists on the question of freedom of the Pressshould be the same as their attitude toward the freedom ofbusiness.... The rule of the democracy which is being established inRussia demands that the domination of the Press by private propertymust be abolished, just as the domination of industry by privateproperty.... The power of the Soviets should confiscate allprinting-plants." (Cries, "Confiscate the printing-shop of_Pravda!_")"The monopoly of the Press by the bourgeoisie must be abolished.Otherwise it isn't worth while for us to take the power! Each groupof citizens should have access to print shops and paper.... Theownership of print-type and of paper belongs first to the workersand peasants, and only afterwards to the bourgeois parties, whichare in a minority.... The passing of the power into the hands of theSoviets will bring about a radical transformation of the essentialconditions of existence, and this transformation will necessarily beevident in the Press.... If we are going to nationalise the banks, canwe then tolerate the financial journals? The old régime must die;that must be understood once and for all...." Applause and angry cries.Karelin declared that the _Tsay-ee-kah_ had no right to pass uponthis important question, which should be left to a specialcommittee. Again, passionately, he demanded that the Press be free.Then Lenin, calm, unemotional, his forehead wrinkled, as he spokeslowly, choosing his words; each sentence falling like ahammer-blow. "The civil war is not yet finished; the enemy is stillwith us; consequently it is impossible to abolish the measures ofrepression against the Press."We Bolsheviki have always said that when we reached a position ofpower we would close the bourgeois press. To tolerate the bourgeoisnewspapers would mean to cease being a Socialist. When one makes aRevolution, one cannot mark time; one must always go forward-or goback. He who now talks about the 'freedom of the Press' goesbackward, and halts our headlong course toward Socialism."We have thrown off the yoke of capitalism, just as the firstrevolution threw off the yoke of Tsarism. _If the first revolutionhad the right to suppress the Monarchist papers,_ then we have theright to suppress the bourgeois press. It is impossible to separatethe question of the freedom of the Press from the other questions ofthe class struggle. We have promised to close these newspapers, andwe shall do it. The immense majority of the people is with us!"Now that the insurrection is over, we have absolutely no desire tosuppress the papers of the other Socialist parties, except inasmuchas they appeal to armed insurrection, or to disobedience to theSoviet Government. However, we shall not permit them, under thepretence of freedom of the Socialist press, to obtain, through thesecret support of the bourgeoisie, a monopoly of printing-presses,ink and paper.... These essentials must become the property of theSoviet Government, and be apportioned, first of all, to theSocialist parties in strict proportion to their voting strength...."Then the vote. The resolution of Larin and the Left SocialistRevolutionaries was defeated by 31 to 22; the Lenin motion wascarried by 34 to 24. Among the minority were the Bolsheviki Riazanovand Lozovsky, who declared that it was impossible for them to voteagainst any restriction on the freedom of the Press.Upon this the Left Socialist Revolutionaries declared they could nolonger be responsible for what was being done, and withdrew from theMilitary Revolutionary Committee and all other positions ofexecutive responsibility.Five members-Nogin, Rykov, Miliutin, Teodorovitch andShiapnikov-resigned from the Council of People's Commissars,declaring:We are in favour of a Socialist Government composed of all theparties in the Soviets. We consider that only the creation of such aGovernment can possibly guarantee the results of the heroic struggleof the working-class and the revolutionary army. Outside of that,there remains only one way: the constitution of a purely BolshevikGovernment by means of political terrorism. This last is the roadtaken by the Council of People's Commissars. We cannot and will notfollow it. We see that this leads directly to the elimination frompolitical life of many proletarian organisations, to theestablishment of an irresponsible régime, and to the destruction ofthe Revolution and the country. We cannot take the responsibilityfor such a policy, and we renounce before the _Tsay-ee-kah_ ourfunction as People's Commissars.Other Commissars, without resigning their positions, signed thedeclaration-Riazanov, Derbychev of the Press Department, Arbuzov, ofthe Government Printing-plant, Yureniev, of the Red Guard, Feodorov,of the Commissariat of Labour, and Larin, secretary of the Sectionof Elaboration of Decrees.At the same time Kameniev, Rykov, Miliutin, Zinoviev and Noginresigned from the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party, makingpublic their reasons:... The constitution of such a Government (composed of all the partiesof the Soviet) is indispensable to prevent a new flow of blood, thecoming famine, the destruction of the Revolution by the Kaledinists,to assure the convocation of the Constituent Assembly at the propertime, and to apply effectively the programme adopted by the Congressof Soviets....We cannot accept the responsibility for the disastrous policy of theCentral Committee, carried on against the will of an enormousmajority of the proletariat and the soldiers, who are eager to seethe rapid end of the bloodshed between the different politicalparties of the democracy.... We renounce our title as members of theCentral Committee, in order to be able to say openly our opinion tothe masses of workers and soldiers....We leave the Central Committee at the moment of victory; we cannotcalmly look on while the policy of the chiefs of the CentralCommittee leads toward the loss of the fruits of victory and thecrushing of the proletariat....The masses of the workers, the soldiers of the garrison, stirredrestlessly, sending their delegations to Smolny, to the Conferencefor Formation of the New Government, where the break in the ranks ofthe Bolsheviki caused the liveliest joy.But the answer of the Leninites was swift and ruthless. Shliapnikovand Teodorovitch submitted to party discipline and returned to theirposts. Kameniev was stripped of his powers as president of the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ and Sverdlov elected in his place. Zinoviev wasdeposed as president of the Petrograd Soviet. On the morning of the5th, _Pravda_ contained a ferocious proclamation to the people ofRussia, written by Lenin, which was printed in hundreds of thousandsof copies, posted on the walls everywhere, and distributed over theface of Russia.The second All-Russian Congress of Soviets gave the majority to theBolshevik party. Only a Government formed by this party cantherefore be a Soviet Government. And it is known to all that theCentral Committee of the Bolshevik party, a few hours before theformation of the new Government and before proposing the list of itsmembers to the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, invited to itsmeeting three of the most eminent members of the Left SocialistRevolutionary group, comrades Kamkov, Spiro and Karelin, and ASKEDTHEM to participate in the new Government. We regret infinitely thatthe invited comrades refused; we consider their refusal inadmissiblefor revolutionists and champions of the working-class; we arewilling at any time to include the Left Socialist Revolutionaries inthe Government; but we declare that, as the party of the majority atthe second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, we are entitled andBOUND before the people to form a Government....... Comrades! Several members of the Central Committee of our partyand the Council of People's Commissars, Kameniev, Zinoviev, Nogin,Rykov, Miliutin and a few others left yesterday, November 17th, theCentral Committee of our party, and the last three, the Council ofPeople's Commissars....The comrades who left us acted like deserters, because they not onlyabandoned the posts entrusted to them, but also disobeyed the directinstructions of the Central Committee of our party, to the effectthat they should await the decisions of the Petrograd and Moscowparty organisations before retiring. We blame decisively suchdesertion. We are firmly convinced that all conscious workers,soldiers and peasants, belonging to our party or sympathising withit, will also disapprove of the behaviour of the deserters....Remember, comrades, that two of these deserters, Kameniev andZinoviev, even before the uprising in Petrograd, appeared asdeserters and strike-breakers, by voting at the decisive meeting ofthe Central Committee, October 23d, 1917, against the insurrection;and even AFTER the resolution passed by the Central Committee, theycontinued their campaign at a meeting of the party workers.... But thegreat impulse of the masses, the great heroism of millions ofworkers, soldiers and peasants, in Moscow, Petrograd, at the front,in the trenches, in the villages, pushed aside the deserters as arailway train scatters saw-dust....Shame upon those who are of little faith, hesitate, who doubt, whoallow themselves to be frightened by the bourgeoisie, or who succumbbefore the cries of the latter's direct or indirect accomplices!There is NOT A SHADOW of hesitation in the MASSES of Petrograd,Moscow, and the rest of Russia....... We shall not submit to any ultimatums from small groups ofintellectuals which are not followed by the masses, which arePRACTICALLY only supported by Kornilovists, Savinkovists, _yunkers,_and so forth....The response from the whole country was like a blast of hot storm.The insurgents never got a chance to "say openly their opinion tothe masses of workers and soldiers." Upon the _Tsay-ee-kah_ rolledin like breakers the fierce popular condemnation of the "deserters."For days Smolny was thronged with angry delegations and committees,from the front, from the Volga, from the Petrograd factories. "Whydid they dare leave the Government? Were they paid by thebourgeoisie to destroy the Revolution? They must return and submitto the decisions of the Central Committee!"Only in the Petrograd garrison was there still uncertainty. A greatsoldier meeting was held on November 24th, addressed byrepresentatives of all the political parties. By a vast majorityLenin's policy was sustained, and the Left Socialist Revolutionarieswere told that they must enter the government.... _See next page._The Mensheviki delivered a final ultimatum, demanding that allMinisters and _yunkers_ be released, that all newspapers be allowedfull freedom, that the Red Guard be disarmed and the garrison putunder command of the Duma. To this Smolny answered that all theSocialist Ministers and also all but a very few _yunkers_ had beenalready set free, that all newspapers were free except the bourgeoispress, and that the Soviet would remain in command of the armedforces.... On the 19th the Conference to Form a New Governmentdisbanded, and the opposition one by one slipped away to Moghilev,where, under the wing of the General Staff, they continued to formGovernment after Government, until the end....[Graphic  Page-276 Meeting announcement]Announcement, posted on the walls of Petrograd, of the result of ameeting of representatives of the garrison regiments, called toconsider the question of forming a new Government. For translationsee App. XI, Sect. 6.Meanwhile the Bolsheviki had been undermining the power of the_Vikzhel._ An appeal of the Petrograd Soviet to all railway workerscalled upon them to force the _Vikzhel_ to surrender its powers. Onthe 15th, the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ following its procedure toward thepeasants, called an All-Russian Congress of Railway Workers forDecember 1st; the _Vikzhel_ immediately called its own Congress fortwo weeks later. On November 16th, the _Vikzhel_ members took theirseats in the _Tsay-ee-kah._ On the night of December 2d, at theopening session of the All-Russian Congress of Railway Workers, the_Tsay-ee-kah_ formally offered the post of Commissar of Ways andCommunications to the _Vikzhel_-which accepted....Having settled the question of power, the Bolsheviki turned theirattention to problems of practical administration. First of all thecity, the country, the Army must be fed. Bands of sailors and RedGuards scoured the warehouses, the railway terminals, even thebarges in the canals, unearthing and confiscating thousands of_poods_  1 of food held by private speculators. Emissaries were sentto the provinces, where with the assistance of the Land Committeesthey seized the store-houses of the great grain-dealers. Expeditionsof sailors, heavily armed, were sent out in groups of five thousand,to the South, to Siberia, with roving commissions to capture citiesstill held by the White Guards, establish order, and _get food._Passenger traffic on the Trans-Siberian Railroad was suspended fortwo weeks, while thirteen trains, loaded with bolts of cloth andbars of iron assembled by the Factory-Shop Committees, were sent outeastward, each in charge of a Commissar, to barter with the Siberianpeasants for grain and potatoes....Kaledin being in possession of the coal-mines of the Don, the fuelquestion became urgent. Smolny shut off all electric lights intheatres, shops and restaurants, cut down the number of street cars,and confiscated the private stores of fire-wood held by thefuel-dealers.... And when the factories of Petrograd were about toclose down for lack of coal, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet turnedover to the workers two hundred thousand _poods_ from the bunkers ofbattle-ships....Toward the end of November occurred the "wine-pogroms" (See App. XI,Sect. 7)-looting of the wine-cellars-beginning with the plunderingof the Winter Palace vaults. For days there were drunken soldiers onthe streets.... In all this was evident the hand of thecounter-revolutionists, who distributed among the regiments plansshowing the location of the stores of liquor. The Commissars ofSmolny began by pleading and arguing, which did not stop the growingdisorder, followed by pitched battles between soldiers and RedGuards.... Finally the Military Revolutionary Committee sent outcompanies of sailors with machine-guns, who fired mercilessly uponthe rioters, killing many; and by executive order the wine-cellarswere invaded by Committees with hatchets, who smashed the bottles-orblew them up with dynamite....Companies of Red Guards, disciplined and well-paid, were on duty atthe headquarters of the Ward Soviets day and night, replacing theold Militia. In all quarters of the city small electiveRevolutionary Tribunals were set up by the workers and soldiers todeal with petty crime....The great hotels, where the speculators still did a thrivingbusiness, were surrounded by Red Guards, and the speculators throwninto jail. (See App. XI, Sect. 8)...Alert and suspicious, the working-class of the city constituteditself a vast spy system, through the servants prying into bourgeoishouseholds, and reporting all information to the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee, which struck with an iron hand, unceasing.In this way was discovered the Monarchist plot led by formerDuma-member Purishkevitch and a group of nobles and officers, whohad planned an officers' uprising, and had written a letter invitingKaledin to Petrograd. (See App. XI, Sect. 9).... In this way wasunearthed the conspiracy of the Petrograd Cadets, who were sendingmoney and recruits to Kaledin....Neratov, frightened at the outburst of popular fury provoked by hisflight, returned and surrendered the Secret Treaties to Trotzky, whobegan their publication in _Pravda,_ scandalising the world....[Graphic Page-279 Proclamation ]Bolshevik order. A proclamation of the Committee to Fight againstPogroms, attached to the Petrograd Soviet. For translation seeApp. XI, Sect. 11.The restrictions on the Press were increased by a decree (See App.XI, Sect. 10) making advertisements a monopoly of the officialGovernment newspaper. At this all the other papers suspendedpublication as a protest, or disobeyed the law and were closed....Only three weeks later did they finally submit.Still the strike of the Ministries went on, still the sabotage ofthe old officials, the stoppage of normal economic life. BehindSmolny was only the will of the vast, unorganised popular masses;and with them the Council of People's Commissars dealt, directingrevolutionary mass-action against its enemies. In eloquentproclamations, (See App. XI, Sect. 12) couched in simple words andspread over Russia, Lenin explained the Revolution, urged the peopleto take the power into their own hands, by force to break down theresistance of the propertied classes, by force to take over theinstitutions of Government. Revolutionary order. Revolutionarydiscipline! Strict accounting and control! No strikes! No loafing![Graphic Page-281 Appeal to work hard ]Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet, the Petrograd Council ofProfessional Unions, and the Petrograd Council of Factory ShopCommittees, to the Workers of Petro. grad, urging them to work hardand not to strike. For translation see App. XI, Sect. 13.On the 20th of November the Military Revolutionary Committee issueda warning:The rich classes oppose the power of the Soviets-the Government ofworkers, soldiers and peasants. Their sympathisers halt the work ofthe employees of the Government and the Duma, incite strikes in thebanks, try to interrupt communication by the railways, the post andthe telegraph....We warn them that they are playing with fire. The country and theArmy are threatened with famine. To fight against it, the regularfunctioning of all services is indispensable. The Workers' andPeasants' Government is taking every measure to assure the countryand the Army all that is necessary. Opposition to these measures isa crime against the People. We warn the rich classes and theirsympathisers that, if they do not cease their sabotage and theirprovocation in halting the transportation of food, they will be thefirst to suffer. They will be deprived of the right of receivingfood. All the reserves which they possess will be requisitioned. Theproperty of the principal criminals will be confiscated.We have done our duty in warning those who play with fire.We are convinced that in case decisive measures become necessary, weshall be solidly supported by all workers, soldiers, and peasants.On the 22d of November the walls of the city were placarded with asheet headed "EXTRAORDINARY COMMUNICATION":The Council of People's Commissars has received an urgent telegramfrom the Staff of the Northern Front...."There must be no further delay; do not let the Army die of hunger;the armies of the Northern Front have not received a crust of breadnow for several days, and in two or three days they will not haveany more biscuits-which are being doled out to them from reservesupplies until now never touched.... Already delegates from all partsof the Front are talking of a necessary removal of part of the Armyto the rear, foreseeing that in a few days there will be headlongflight of the soldiers, dying from hunger, ravaged by the threeyears' war in the trenches, sick, insufficiently clothed,bare-footed, driven mad by superhuman misery."The Military Revolutionary Committee brings this to the notice ofthe Petrograd garrison and the workers of Petrograd. The situationat the Front demands the most urgent and decisive measures. ...Meanwhile the higher functionaries of the Government institutions,banks, railroads, post and telegraph, are on strike and impeding thework of the Government in supplying the Front with provisions.... Eachhour of delay may cost the life of thousands of soldiers. Thecounter-revolutionary functionaries are the most dishonest criminalstoward their hungry and dying brethren on the Front....The MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE GIVES THESE CRIMINALS A LASTWARNING. In event of the least resistance or opposition on theirpart, the harshness of the measures which will be adopted againstthem will correspond to the seriousness of their crime....------------------+----------+The masses of workers and soldiers responded by a savage tremor ofrage, which swept all Russia. In the capital the Government and bankemployees got out hundreds of proclamations and appeals (See App.XI, Sect. 14), protesting, defending themselves, such as this one:TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL CITIZENS.THE STATE BANK IS CLOSED!WHY?Because the violence exercised by the Bolsheviki against the StateBank has made it impossible for us to work. The first act of thePeople's Commissars was to DEMAND TEN MILLION RUBLES, and onNovember 27th THEY DEMANDED TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS, without anyindication as to where this money was to go.... We functionaries cannot take part in plundering the people'sproperty. We stopped work.CITIZENS! The money in the State Bank is yours, the people's money,acquired by your labour, your sweat and blood. CITIZENS! Save thepeople's property from robbery, and us from violence, and we shallimmediately resume work.EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE BANK.From the Ministry of Supplies, the Ministry of Finance, from theSpecial Supply Committee, declarations that the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee made it impossible for the employees towork, appeals to the population to support them against Smolny.... Butthe dominant worker and soldier did not believe them; it was firmlyfixed in the popular mind that the employees were sabotaging,starving the Army, starving the people.... In the long bread lines,which as formerly stood in the iron winter streets, it was not _theGovernment_ which was blamed, as it had been under Kerensky, but the_tchinovniki,_ the sabotageurs; for the Government was _their_Government, _their_ Soviets-and the functionaries of the Ministrieswere against it....At the centre of all this opposition was the Duma, and its militantorgan, the Committee for Salvation, protesting against all thedecrees of the Council of People's Commissars, voting again andagain not to recognise the Soviet Government, openly cooperatingwith the new counter-revolutionary "Governments" set up atMoghilev.... On the 17th of November, for example, the Committee forSalvation addressed "all Municipal Governments, Zemstvos, and alldemocratic and revolutionary organisations of peasants, workers,soldiers and other citizens," in these words:Do not recognise the Government of the Bolsheviki, and struggleagainst it.Form local Committees for Salvation of Country and Revolution, whowill unite all democratic forces, so as to aid the All-RussianCommittee for Salvation in the tasks which it has set itself....Meanwhile the elections for the Constituent Assembly in Petrograd(See App. XI, Sect. 15) gave an enormous plurality to theBolsheviki; so that even the Mensheviki Internationalists pointedout that the Duma ought to be re-elected, as it no longerrepresented the political composition of the Petrograd population....At the same time floods of resolutions from workers' organisations,from military units, even from the peasants in the surroundingcountry, poured in upon the Duma, calling it "counter-revolutionary,Kornilovitz," and demanding that it resign. The last days of theDuma were stormy with the bitter demands of the Municipal workersfor decent living wages, and the threat of strikes....On the 23d a formal decree of the Military Revolutionary Committeedissolved the Committee for Salvation. On the 29th, the Council ofPeople's Commissars ordered the dissolution and re-election of thePetrograd City Duma:In view of the fact that the Central Duma of Petrograd, electedSeptember 2d, ... has definitely lost the right to represent thepopulation of Petrograd, being in complete disaccord with its stateof mind and its aspirations ... and in view of the fact that thepersonnel of the Duma majority, although having lost all politicalfollowing, continues to make use of its prerogatives to resist in acounter-revolutionary manner the will of the workers, soldiers andpeasants, to sabotage and obstruct the normal work of theGovernment-the Council of People's Commissars considers it its dutyto invite the population of the capital to pronounce judgment on thepolicy of the organ of Municipal autonomy.To this end the Council of People's Commissars resolves:(1) To dissolve the Municipal Duma; the dissolution to take effectNovember 30th, 1917.(2) All functionaries elected or appointed by the present Duma shallremain at their posts and fulfil the duties confided to them, untiltheir places shall be filled by representatives of the new Duma.(3) All Municipal employees shall continue to fulfil their duties;those who leave the service of their own accord shall be considereddischarged.(4) The new elections for the Municipal Duma of Petrograd are fixedfor December 9th, 1917....(5) The Municipal Duma of Petrograd shall meet December 11th, 1917,at two o'clock.(6) Those who disobey this decree, as well as those whointentionally harm or destroy the property of the Municipality,shall be immediately arrested and brought before the RevolutionaryTribunals....The Duma met defiantly, passing resolutions to the effect that itwould "defend its position to the last drop of its blood," andappealing desperately to the population to save their "own electedCity Government." But the population remained indifferent orhostile. On the 31st Mayor Schreider and several members werearrested, interrogated, and released. That day and the next the Dumacontinued to meet, interrupted frequently by Red Guards and sailors,who politely requested the assembly to disperse. At the meeting ofDecember 2d, an officer and some sailors entered the Nicolai Hallwhile a member was speaking, and ordered the members to leave, orforce would be used. They did so, protesting to the last, butfinally "ceding to violence."The new Duma, which was elected ten days later, and for which the"Moderate" Socialists refused to vote, was almost entirelyBolshevik....There remained several centres of dangerous opposition, such as the"republics" of Ukraine and Finland, which were showing definitelyanti-Soviet tendencies. Both at Helsingfors and at Kiev theGovernments were gathering troops which could be depended upon, andentering upon campaigns of crushing Bolshevism, and of disarming andexpelling Russian troops. The Ukrainean Rada had taken command ofall southern Russia, and was furnishing Kaledin reinforcements andsupplies. Both Finland and Ukraine were beginning secretnegotiations with the Germans, and were promptly recognised by theAllied Governments, which loaned them huge sums of money, joiningwith the propertied classes to create counter-revolutionary centresof attack upon Soviet Russia. In the end, when Bolshevism hadconquered in both these countries, the defeated bourgeoisie calledin the Germans to restore them to power....But the most formidable menace to the Soviet Government was internaland two-headed-the Kaledin movement, and the Staff at Moghilev,where General Dukhonin had assumed command.Graphic Page-287 Education Proclamation]Proclamation of the Commission of Public Education attached to theCity Duma, concerning the strike of school-teachers, just before theChristmas holidays. The Duma had been re-elected, and was composedalmost entirely of Bolsheviki. For translation see App. XI, Sect. 17.The ubiquitous Muraviov was appointed commander of the war againstthe Cossacks, and a Red Army was recruited from among the factoryworkers. Hundreds of propagandists were sent to the Don. The Councilof People's Commissars issued a proclamation to the Cossacks, (SeeApp. XI, Sect. 16) explaining what the Soviet Government was, howthe propertied classes, the _tchin ovniki,_ landlords, bankers andtheir allies, the Cossack princes, land-owners and Generals, weretrying to destroy the Revolution, and prevent the confiscation oftheir wealth by the people.On November 27th a committee of Cossacks came to Smolny to seeTrotzky and Lenin. They demanded if it were true that the SovietGovernment did not intend to divide the Cossack lands among thepeasants of Great Russia? "No," answered Trotzky. The Cossacksdeliberated for a while. "Well," they asked, "does the SovietGovernment intend to confiscate the estates of our great Cossackland-owners and divide them among the working Cossacks?" To thisLenin replied. "That," he said, "is for _you_ to do. We shallsupport the working Cossacks in all their actions.... The best way tobegin is to form Cossacks Soviets; you will be given representationin the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and then it will be _your_ Government, too....The Cossacks departed, thinking hard. Two weeks later GeneralKaledin received a deputation from his troops. "Will you," theyasked, "promise to divide the great estates of the Cossack landlordsamong the working Cossacks?""Only over my dead body," responded Kaledin. A month later, seeinghis army melt away before his eyes, Kaledin blew out his brains. Andthe Cossack movement was no more....Meanwhile at Moghilev were gathered the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ the"moderate" Socialist leaders-from Avksentiev to Tchernov-the activechiefs of the old Army Committees, and the reactionary officers. TheStaff steadily refused to recognise the Council of People'sCommissars. It had united about it the Death Battalions, the Knightsof St. George, and the Cossacks of the Front, and was in close andsecret touch with the Allied military attachès, and with the Kaledinmovement and the Ukrainean Rada....The Allied Governments had made no reply to the Peace decree ofNovember 8th, in which the Congress of Soviets had asked for ageneral armistice.On November 20th Trotzky addressed a note to the Allied Ambassadors:(See App. XI, Sect. 18)I have the honour to inform you, Mr. Ambassador, that theAll-Russian Congress of Soviets... on November 8th constituted a newGovernment of the Russian Republic, in the form of the Council ofPeople's Commissars. The President of this Government is VladimirIlyitch Lenin. The direction of Foreign Affairs has been entrustedto me, People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs....In drawing your attention to the text, approved by the All-RussianCongress, of the proposition for an armistice and a democratic peacewithout annexations or indemnities, based on the right ofself-determination of peoples, I have the honour to request you toconsider that document as a formal proposal of an immediatearmistice on all fronts, and the opening of immediate peacenegotiations; a proposal which the authorised Government of theRussian Republic addresses at the same time to all the belligerentpeoples and their Governments.Please accept, Mr. Ambassador, the profound assurance of the esteemof the Soviet Government toward your people, who cannot but wish forpeace, like all the other peoples exhausted and drained by thisunexampled butchery....The same night the Council of People's Commissars telegraphed toGeneral Dukhonin:... The Council of People's Commissars considers it indispensablewithout delay to make a formal proposal of armistice to all thepowers, both enemy and Allied. A declaration conforming to thisdecision has been sent by the Commissar for Foreign Affairs to therepresentatives of the Allied powers at Petrograd.The Council of People's Commissars orders you, Citizen Commander,...to propose to the enemy military authorities immediately to ceasehostilities, and enter into negotiations for peace.In charging you with the conduct of these preliminary pourparlers,the Council of People's Commissars orders you:1. To inform the Council by direct wire immediately of any and allsteps in the pourparlers with the representatives of the enemyarmies.2. Not to sign the act of armistice until it has been passed upon bythe Council of People's Commissars.The Allied Ambassadors received Trotzky's note with contemptuoussilence, accompanied by anonymous interviews in the newspapers, fullof spite and ridicule. The order to Dukhonin was characterisedopenly as an act of treason....As for Dukhonin, he gave no sign. On the night of November 22nd hewas communicated with by telephone, and asked if he intended to obeythe order. Dukhonin answered that he could not, unless it emanatedfrom "a Government sustained by the Army and the country."By telegraph he was immediately dismissed from the post of SupremeCommander, and Krylenko appointed in his place. Following histactics of appealing to the masses, Lenin sent a radio to allregimental, divisional and corps Committees, to all soldiers andsailors of the Army and the Fleet, acquainting them with Dukhonin'srefusal, and ordering that "the regiments on the front shall electdelegates to begin negotiations with the enemy detachments oppositetheir positions...."On the 23d, the military attaches of the Allied nations, acting oninstructions from their Governments, presented a note to Dukhonin,in which he was solemnly warned not to "violate the conditions ofthe treaties concluded between the Powers of the Entente." The notewent on to say that if a separate armistice with Germany wereconcluded, that act "would result in the most serious consequences"to Russia. This communication Dukhonin at once sent out to all thesoldiers' Committees....Next morning Trotzky made another appeal to the troops,characterising the note of the Allied representatives as a flagrantinterference in the internal affairs of Russia, and a bald attempt"to force by threats the Russian Army and the Russian people tocontinue the war in execution of the treaties concluded by theTsar...."From Smolny poured out proclamation after proclamation, (See App.XI, Sect. 19) denouncing Dukhonin and the counter-revolutionaryofficers about him, denouncing the reactionary politicians gatheredat Moghilev, rousing, from one end of the thousand-mile Front to theother, millions of angry, suspicious soldiers. And at the same timeKrylenko, accompanied by three detachments of fanatical sailors, setout for the _Stavka,_ breathing threats of vengeance, (See App. XI,Sect. 20) and received by the soldiers everywhere with tremendousovations-a triumphal progress. The Central Army Committee issued adeclaration in favour of Dukhonin; and at once ten thousand troopsmoved upon Moghilev....On December 2d the garrison of Moghilev rose and seized the city,arresting Dukhonin and the Army Committee, and going out withvictorious red banners to meet the new Supreme Commander. Krylenkoentered Moghilev next morning, to find a howling mob gathered aboutthe railway-car in which Dukhonin had been imprisoned. Krylenko madea speech in which he implored the soldiers not to harm Dukhonin, ashe was to be taken to Petrograd and judged by the RevolutionaryTribunal. When he had finished, suddenly Dukhonin himself appearedat the window, as if to address the throng. But with a savage roarthe people rushed the car, and falling upon the old General, draggedhim out and beat him to death on the platform....So ended the revolt of the _Stavka_....Immensely strengthened by the collapse of the last importantstronghold of hostile military power in Russia, the SovietGovernment began with confidence the organisation of the state. Manyof the old functionaries flocked to its banner, and many members ofother parties entered the Government service. The financiallyambitious, however, were checked by the decree on Salaries ofGovernment Employees, fixing the salaries of the People'sCommissars-the highest-at five hundred rubles (about fifty dollars)a month.... The strike of Government Employees, led by the Union ofUnions, collapsed, deserted by the financial and commercialinterests which had been backing it. The bank clerks returned totheir jobs....With the decree on the Nationalisation of Banks, the formation ofthe Supreme Council of People's Economy, the putting into practicaloperation of the Land decree in the villages, the democraticreorganisation of the Army, and the sweeping changes in all branchesof the Government and of life,-with all these, effective only by thewill of the masses of workers, soldiers and peasants, slowly began,with many mistakes and hitches, the moulding of proletarian Russia.Not by compromise with the propertied classes, or with the otherpolitical leaders; not by conciliating the old Government mechanism,did the Bolsheviki conquer the power. Nor by the organized violenceof a small clique. If the masses all over Russia had not been readyfor insurrection it must have failed. The only reason for Bolsheviksuccess lay in their accomplishing the vast and simple desires ofthe most profound strata of the people, calling them to the work oftearing down and destroying the old, and afterward, in the smoke offalling ruins, cooperating with them to erect the frame-work of thenew....                              Chapter XII                        The Peasants' CongressIT was on November 18th that the snow came. In the morning we woketo window-ledges heaped white, and snowflakes falling so whirlingthick that it was impossible to see ten feet ahead. The mud wasgone; in a twinkling the gloomy city became white, dazzling. The_droshki_ with their padded coachmen turned into sleights, boundingalong the uneven street at headlong speed, their drivers' beardsstiff and frozen.... In spite of Revolution, all Russia plungingdizzily into the unknown and terrible future, joy swept the citywith the coming of the snow. Everybody was smiling; people ran intothe streets, holding out their arms to the soft, falling flakes,laughing. Hidden was all the greyness; only the gold and colouredspires and cupolas, with heightened barbaric splendour, gleamedthrough the white snow.Even the sun came out, pale and watery, at noon. The colds andrheumatism of the rainy months vanished. The life of the city grewgay, and the very Revolution ran swifter....I sat one evening in a _traktir_-a kind of lower-class inn-acrossthe street from the gates of Smolny; a low-ceilinged, loud placecalled "Uncle Tom's Cabin," much frequented by Red Guards. Theycrowded it now, packed close around the little tables with theirdirty table-cloths and enormous china tea-pots, filling the placewith foul cigarette-smoke, while the harassed waiters ran aboutcrying _"Seichass! Seichass!_ In a minute! Right away!"In one corner sat a man in the uniform of a captain, addressing theassembly, which interrupted him at every few words."You are no better than murderers!" he cried. "Shooting down yourRussian brothers on the streets!""When did we do that?" asked a worker."Last Sunday you did it, when the _yunkers_--""Well, didn't they shoot us?" One man exhibited his arm in a sling."Haven't I got something to remember them by, the devils?"The captain shouted at the top of his voice. "You should remainneutral! You should remain neutral! Who are you to destroy the legalGovernment? Who is Lenin? A German--""Who are you? A counter-revolutionist! A provocator!" they bellowedat him.When he could make himself heard the captain stood up. "All right!"said he. "You call yourselves the people of Russia. But you're _not_the people of Russia. The _peasants_ are the people of Russia. Waituntil the peasants--""Yes," they cried, "wait until the peasants speak. We know what thepeasants will say.... Aren't they workingmen like ourselves?"In the long run, everything depended upon the peasants. While thepeasants had been politically backward, still they had their ownpeculiar ideas, and they constituted more than eighty per cent ofthe people of Russia. The Bolsheviki had a comparatively smallfollowing among the peasants; and a permanent dictatorship of Russiaby the industrial workers was impossible.... The traditional peasantparty was the Socialist Revolutionary party; of all the parties nowsupporting the Soviet Government, the Left Socialist Revolutionarieswere the logical inheritors of peasant leadership-and the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries, who were at the mercy of the organisedcity proletariat, desperately needed the backing of the peasants....Meanwhile Smolny had not neglected the peasants. After the Landdecree, one of the first actions of the new _Tsay-ee-kah_ had beento call a Congress of Peasants, over the head of the ExecutiveCommittee of the Peasants' Soviets. A few days later was issueddetailed Regulations for the _Volost_ (Township) Land Committees,followed by Lenin's "Instruction to Peasants," (See App. XII, Sect.1) which explained the Bolshevik revolution and the new Governmentin simple terms; and on November 16th, Lenin and Miliutin publishedthe "Instructions to Provincial Emissaries," of whom thousands weresent by the Soviet Government into the villages.1. Upon his arrival in the province to which he is accredited, theemissary should call a joint meeting of the Central ExecutiveCommittees of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants'Deputies, to whom he should make a report on the agrarian laws, andthen demand that a joint plenary session of the Soviets be summoned....2. He must study the aspects of the agrarian problem in the province.a. Has the land-owners' property been taken over, and if so, in whatdistricts?b. Who administers the confiscated land-the former proprietor, orthe Land Committees?c. What has been done with the agricultural machinery and with thefarm-animals?3. Has the ground cultivated by the peasants been augmented?4. How much and in what respect does the amount of land now undercultivation differ from the amount fixed by the Government as anaverage minimum?5. The emissary must insist that, after the peasants have receivedthe land, it is imperative that they increase the amount ofcultivated land as quickly as possible, and that they hasten thesending of grain to the cities, as the only means of avoiding famine.6. What are the measures projected or put into effect for thetransfer of land from the land-owners to the Land Committees andsimilar bodies appointed by the Soviets?7. It is desirable that agricultural properties well appointed andwell organised should be administered by Soviets composed of theregular employees of those properties, under the direction ofcompetent agricultural scientists.All through the villages a ferment of change was going on, causednot only by the electrifying action of the Land decree, but also bythousands of revolutionary-minded peasant-soldiers returning fromthe front.... These men, especially, welcomed the call to a Congressof Peasants.Like the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ in the matter of the second Congress ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Soviets, the Executive Committee tried toprevent the Peasant Congress summoned by Smolny. And like the old_Tsay-ee-kah,_ finding its resistance futile, the ExecutiveCommittee sent frantic telegrams ordering the election ofConservative delegates. Word was even spread among the peasants thatthe Congress would meet at Moghilev, and some delegates went there;but by November 23d about four hundred had gathered in Petrograd,and the party caucuses had begun....The first session took place in the Alexander Hall of the Dumabuilding, and the first vote showed that more than half of all thedelegates were Left Socialist Revolutionaries, while the Bolshevikicontrolled a bare fifth, the conservative Socialist Revolutionariesa quarter, and all the rest were united only in their opposition tothe old Executive Committee, dominated by Avksentiev, Tchaikovskyand Peshekhonov....The great hall was jammed with people and shaken with continualclamour; deep, stubborn bitterness divided the delegates into angrygroups. To the right was a sprinkling of officers' epaulettes, andthe patriarchal, bearded faces of the older, more substantialpeasants; in the centre were a few peasants, non-commissionedofficers, and some soldiers; and on the left almost all thedelegates wore the uniforms of common soldiers. These last were theyoung generation, who had been serving in the army.... The gallerieswere thronged with workers-who, in Russia, still remember theirpeasant origin....Unlike the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the Executive Committee, in openingthe session, did not recognise the Congress as official; theofficial Congress was called for December 13th; amid a hurricane ofapplause and angry cries, the speaker declared that this gatheringwas merely "Extraordinary Conference"... But the "ExtraordinaryConference" soon showed its attitude toward the Executive Committeeby electing as presiding officer Maria Spiridonova, leader of theLeft Socialist Revolution aries.Most of the first day was taken up by a violent debate as to whetherthe representatives of _Volost_ Soviets should be seated, or onlydelegates from the Provincial bodies; and just as in the Workers'and Soldiers' Congress, an overwhelming majority declared in favourof the widest possible representation. Whereupon the old ExecutiveCommittee left the hall....Almost immediately it was evident that most of the delegates werehostile to the Government of the People's Commissars. Zinoviev,attempting to speak for the Bolsheviki, was hooted down, and as heleft the platform, amid laughter, there were cries, "There's how aPeople's Commissar sits in a mudpuddle!""We Left Socialist Revolutionaries refuse," cried Nazariev, adelegate from the Provinces, "to recognise this so-called Workers'and Peasants' Government until the peasants are represented in it.At present it is nothing but a dictatorship of the workers.... Weinsist upon the formation of a new Government which will representthe entire democracy!"The reactionary delegates shrewdly fostered this feeling, declaring,in the face of protests from the Bolshevik benches, that the Councilof People's Commissars intended either to control the Congress ordissolve it by force of arms-an announcement which was received bythe peasants with bursts of fury....On the third day Lenin suddenly mounted the tribune; for ten minutesthe room went mad. "Down with him!" they shrieked. "We will notlisten to any of your People's Commissars! We don't recognise yourGovernment!"Lenin stood there quite calmly, gripping the desk with both hands,his little eyes thoughtfully surveying the tumult beneath. Finally,except for the right side of the hall, the demonstration wore itselfout somewhat."I do not come here as a member of the Council of People'sCommissars," said Lenin, and waited again for the noise to subside,"but as a member of the Bolshevik faction, duly elected to thisCongress." And he held his credentials up to that all might see them."However," he went on, in an unmoved voice, "nobody will deny thatthe present Government of Russia has been formed by the Bolshevikparty-" he had to wait a moment, "so that for all purposes it is thesame thing...." Here the right benches broke into deafening clamour,but the centre and left were curious, and compelled silence.Lenin's argument was simple. "Tell me frankly, you peasants, to whomwe have given the lands of the _pomieshtchiki;_ do you want now toprevent the workers from getting control of industry? This is classwar. The _pomieshtchiki_ of course oppose the peasants, and themanufactures oppose the workers. Are you going to allow the ranks ofthe proletariat to be divided? Which side will you be on?"We, the Bolsheviki, are the party of the proletariat-of the peasantproletariat as well as the industrial proletariat. We, theBolsheviki, are the protectors of the Soviets-of the Peasants'Soviets as well as those of the Workers and Soldiers. The presentGovernment is a Government of Soviets; we have not only invited thePeasants' Soviets to join that Government, but we have also invitedrepresentatives of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to enter theCouncil of People's Commissars...."The Soviets are the most perfect representatives of the people-ofthe workers in the factories and mines, of the workers in thefields. Anybody who attempts to destroy the Soviets is guilty of ananti-democratic and counter-revolutionary act. And I serve noticehere on you, comrades _Right_ Socialist Revolutionaries-and on you,Messrs. Cadets-that if the Constituent Assembly attempts to destroythe Soviets, we shall not permit the Constituent Assembly to do thisthing!"On the afternoon of November 25th Tchernov arrived in hot haste fromMoghilev, summoned by the Executive Committee. Only two monthsbefore considered an extreme revolutionist, and very popular withthe peasants, he was now called to check the dangerous drift of theCongress toward the Left. Upon his arrival Tchernov was arrested andtaken to Smolny, where, after a short conversation, he was released.His first act was to bitterly rebuke the Executive Committee forleaving the Congress. They agreed to return, and Tchernov enteredthe hall, welcomed with great applause by the majority, and thehoots and jeers of the Bolsheviki."Comrades! I have been away. I participated in the Conference of theTwelfth Army on the question of calling a Congress of all thePeasant delegates of the armies of the Western Front, and I knowvery little about the insurrection which occurred here--"Zinoviev rose in his seat, and shouted, "Yes, you were away-for afew minutes!" Fearful tumult. Cries, "Down with the Bolsheviki!"Tchernov continued. "The accusation that I helped lead an army onPetrograd has no foundation, and is entirely false. Where does suchan accusation come from? Show me the source!"Zinoviev: "_Izviestia_ and _Dielo Naroda_-your own paper -that'swhere it comes from!"Tchernov's wide face, with the small eyes, waving hair and greyishbeard, became red with wrath, but he controlled himself and went on."I repeat, I know practically nothing about what has happened here,and I did not lead any army except this army, (he pointed to thepeasant delegates), which I am largely responsible for bringinghere!" Laughter, and shouts of "Bravo!""Upon my return I visited Smolny. No such accusation was madeagainst me there.... After a brief conversation I left-and that's all!Let any one present make such an accusation!"An uproar followed, in which the Bolsheviki and some of the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries were on their feet all at once, shakingtheir fists and yelling, and the rest of the assembly tried to yellthem down."This is an outrage, not a session!" cried Tchernov, and he left thehall; the meeting was adjourned because of the noise and disorder....Meanwhile, the question of the status of the Executive Committee wasagitating all minds. By declaring the assembly "ExtraordinaryConference," it had been planned to block the reelection of theExecutive Committee. But this worked both ways; the Left SocialistRevolutionists decided that if the Congress had no power over theExecutive Committee, then the Executive Committee had no power overthe Congress. On November 25th the assembly resolved that the powersof the Executive Committee be assumed by the ExtraordinaryConference, in which only members of the Executive who had beenelected as delegates might vote....The next day, in spite of the bitter opposition of the Bolsheviki,the resolution was amended to give all the members of the ExecutiveCommittee, whether elected as delegates or not, voice and vote inthe assembly.On the 27th occurred the debate on the Land question, which revealedthe differences between the agrarian programme of the Bolsheviki andthe Left Socialist Revolutionaries.Kolchinsky, for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, outlined thehistory of the Land question during the Revolution. The firstCongress of Peasants' Soviets, he said, had voted a precise andformal resolution in favour of putting the landed estatesimmediately into the hands of the Land Committees. But the directorsof the Revolution, and the bourgeois in the Government, had insistedthat the question could not be solved until the Constituent Assemblymet.... The second period of the Revolution, the period of"compromise,"was signalled by the entrance of Tchernov into theCabinet. The peasants were convinced that now the practical solutionof the Land question would begin; but in spite of the imperativedecision of the first Peasant Congress, the reactionaries andconciliators in the Executive Committee had prevented any action.This policy provoked a series of agrarian disorders, which appearedas the natural expression of impatience and thwarted energy on thepart of the peasants. The peasants understood the exact meaning ofthe Revolution-they tried to turn words into action...."The recent events," said the orator, "do not indicate a simpleriot, or a 'Bolshevik adventure,' but on the contrary, a realpopular rising, which has been greeted with sympathy by the wholecountry...."The Bolsheviki in general took the correct attitude toward the Landquestion; but in recommending that the peasants seize the land byforce, they committed a profound error.... From the first days, theBolsheviki declared that the peasants should take over the land 'byrevolutionary massaction.' This is nothing but anarchy; the land canbe taken over in an organised manner.... For the Bolsheviki it wasimportant that the problems of the Revolution should be solved inthe quickest possible manner-but the Bolsheviki were not interestedin _how_ these problems were to be solved...."The Land decree of the Congress of Soviets is identical in itsfundamentals with the decisions of the first Peasants' Congress. Whythen did not the new Government follow the tactics outlined by thatCongress? Because the Council of People's Commissars wanted tohasten the settlement of the Land question, so that the ConstituentAssembly would have nothing to do...."But also the Government saw that it was necessary to adoptpractical measures, so without further reflection, it adopted theRegulations for Land Committees, thus creating a strange situation;for the Council of People's Commissars abolished private property inland, but the Regulations drawn up by the Land Committees are basedon private property.... However, no harm has been done by that; forthe Land Committees are paying no attention to the Soviet decrees,but are putting into operation their own practicaldecisions-decisions based on the will of the vast majority of thepeasants...."These Land Committees are not attempting the legislative solutionof the Land question, which belongs to the Constituent Assemblyalone.... But will the Constituent Assembly desire to do the will ofthe Russian peasants? Of that we cannot be sure.... All we can be sureof is that the revolutionary determination of the peasants is nowaroused, and that the Constituent will be _forced_ to settle theLand question the way the peasants want it settled.... The ConstituentAssembly will not dare to break with the will of the people...."Followed him Lenin, listened to now with absorbing intensity. "Atthis moment we are not only trying to solve the Land question, butthe question of Social Revolution-not only here in Russia, but allover the world. The Land question cannot be solved independently ofthe other problems of the Social Revolution.... For example, theconfiscation of the landed estates will provoke the resistance notonly of Russian land-owners, but also of foreign capital-with whomthe great landed properties are connected through the intermediaryof the banks...."The ownership of the land in Russia is the basis for immenseoppression, and the confiscation of the land by the peasants is themost important step of our Revolution. But it cannot be separatedfrom the other steps, as is clearly manifested by the stages throughwhich the Revolution has had to pass. The first stage was thecrushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of theindustrial capitalists and land-owners, whose interests are closelyrelated. The second stage was the strengthening of the Soviets andthe political compromise with the bourgeoisie. The mistake of theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries lies in the fact that at that timethey did not oppose the policy of compromise, because they held thetheory that the consciousness of the masses was not yet fullydeveloped...._"If Socialism can only be realised when the intellectualdevelopment of all the people permits it, then we shall not seeSocialism for at least five hundred years_.... The Socialist politicalparty-this is the vanguard of the working-class; it must not allowitself to be halted by the lack of education of the mass average,but it must lead the masses, using the Soviets as organs ofrevolutionary initiative.... But in order to lead the wavering, thecomrades Left Socialist Revolutionaries themselves must stophesitating...."In July last a series of open breaks began between the popularmasses and the 'compromisers'; but now, in November, the LeftSocialist Revolutionaries are still holding out their hand toAvksentiev, who is pulling the people with his little finger.... IfCompromise continues, the Revolution disappears. No compromise withthe bourgeoisie is possible; its power must be absolutely crushed...."We Bolsheviki have not changed our Land programme; we have notgiven up the abolition of private property in the land, and we donot intend to do so. We adopted the Regulations for LandCommittees,-which are _not_ based on private property at all-becausewe want to accomplish the popular will in the way the people havethemselves decided to do it, so as to draw closer the coalition ofall the elements who are fighting for the Social Revolution."We invite the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to enter thatcoalition, insisting, however, that they cease looking backward, andthat they break with the 'conciliators' of their party...."As far as the Constituent Assembly is concerned, it is true, as thepreceding speaker has said, that the work of the Constituent willdepend on the revolutionary determination of the masses. I say,'Count on that revolutionary determination, but don't forget yourgun!'"Lenin then read the Bolshevik resolution:The Peasants' Congress, fully supporting the Land decree of November8th... approves of the Provisional Workers' and Peasants' Governmentof the Russian Republic, established by the second All-RussianCongress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.The Peasants' Congress... invites all peasants unanimously to sustainthat law, and to apply it immediately themselves; and at the sametime invites the peasants to appoint to posts and positions ofresponsibility only persons who have proved, not by words but byacts, their entire devotion to the interests of the exploitedpeasant-workers, their desire and their ability to defend theseinterests against all resistance on the part of the greatland-owners, the capitalists, their partisans and accomplices....The Peasants' Congress, at the same time, expresses its convictionthat the complete realisation of all the measures which make up theLand decree can only be successful through the triumph of theWorkers' Social Revolution, which began November 7th, 1917; for onlythe Social Revolution can accomplish the definite transfer, withoutpossibility of return, of the land to the peasant-workers, theconfiscation of model farms and their surrender to the peasantcommunes, the confiscation of agricultural machinery belonging tothe great land-owners, the safe-guarding of the interests of theagricultural workers by the complete abolition of wage-slavery, theregular and methodical distribution among all regions of Russia ofthe products of agriculture and industry, and the seizure of thebanks (without which the possession of land by the whole peoplewould be impossible, after the abolition of private property), andall sorts of assistance by the State to the workers....For these reasons the Peasants' Congress sustains entirely theRevolution of November 7th... as a social revolution, and expressesits unalterable will to put into operation, with whatevermodifications are necessary, but without any hesitation, the socialtransformation of the Russian Republic.The indispensable conditions of the victory of the SocialRevolution, which alone will secure the lasting success and thecomplete realisation of the Land decree, is the close union of thepeasant-workers with the industrial working-class, with theproletariat of all advanced countries. From now on, in the RussianRepublic, all the organisation and administration of the State, fromtop to bottom, must rest on that union. That union, crushing allattempts, direct or indirect, open or dissimulated, to return to thepolicy of conciliation with the bourgeoisie-conciliation, damned byexperience, with the chiefs of bourgeois politics-can alone insurethe victory of Socialism throughout the world....The reactionaries of the Executive Committee no longer dared openlyto appear. Tchernov, however, spoke several times, with a modest andwinning impartiality. He was invited to sit on the platform.... On thesecond night of the Congress an anonymous note was handed up to thechairman, requesting that Tchernov be made honorary President.Ustinov read the note aloud, and immediately Zinoviev was on hisfeet, screaming that this was a trick of the old Executive Committeeto capture the convention; in a moment the hall was one bellowingmass of waving arms and angry faces, on both sides.... Nevertheless,Tchernov remained very popular.In the stormy debates on the Land question and the Lenin resolution,the Bolsheviki were twice on the point of quitting the assembly,both times restrained by their leaders.... It seemed to me as if theCongress were hopelessly deadlocked.But none of us knew that a series of secret conferences were alreadygoing on between the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and theBolsheviki at Smolny. At first the Left Socialist Revolutionarieshad demanded that there be a Government composed of all theSocialist parties in and out of the Soviets, to be responsible to aPeople's Council, composed of an equal number of delegates from theWorkers' and Soldiers' organisation, and that of the Peasants, andcompleted by representatives of the City Dumas and the Zemstvos;Lenin and Trotzky were to be eliminated, and the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee and other repressive organs dissolved.Wednesday morning, November 28th, after a terrible all-nightstruggle, an agreement was reached. The _Tsay-ee-kah,_composed of108 members, was to be augumented by 108 members electedproportionally from the Peasants' Congress; by 100 delegates electeddirectly from the Army and the Fleet; and by 50 representatives ofthe Trade Unions (35 from the general Unions, 10 Railway Workers,and 5 from the Post and Telegraph Workers). The Dumas and Zemstvoswere dropped. Lenin and Trotzky remained in the Government, and theMilitary Revolutionary Committee continued to function.The sessions of the Congress had now been removed to the ImperialLaw School building, Fontanka 6, headquarters of the Peasants'Soviets. There in the great meeting-hall the delegates gathered onWednesday afternoon. The old Executive Committee had withdrawn, andwas holding a rump convention of its own in another room of the samebuilding, made up of bolting delegates and representatives of theArmy Committees.Tchernov went from one meeting to the other, keeping a watchful eyeon the proceedings. He knew that an agreement with the Bolshevikiwas being discussed, but he did not know that it had been concluded.He spoke to the rump convention. "At present, when everybody is infavour of forming an all-Socialist Government, many people forgetthe first Ministry, which was _not_ a coalition Government, and inwhich there was only one Socialist-Kerensky; a Government which, inits time, was very popular. Now people accuse Kerensky; they forgetthat he was raised to power, not only by the Soviets, but also bythe popular masses...."Why did public opinion change toward Kerensky? The savages set upgods to which they pray, and which they punish if one of theirprayers is not answered.... That is what is happening at this moment....Yesterday Kerensky; today Lenin and Trotzky; another to-morrow...."We have proposed to both Kerensky and the Bolsheviki to retire fromthe power. Kerensky has accepted-to-day he announced from hishiding-place that he has resigned as Premier; but the Bolshevikiwish to retain the power, and they do not know how to use it...."If the Bolsheviki succeed, or if they fail, the fate of Russia willnot be changed. The Russian villages understand perfectly what theywant, and they are now carrying out their own measures.... Thevillages will save us in the end...."In the meanwhile, in the great hall Ustinov had announced theagreement between the Peasants' Congress and Smolny, received by thedelegates with the wildest joy. Suddenly Tchernov appeared, anddemanded the floor."I understand," he began, "that an agreement is being concludedbetween the Peasants' Congress and Smolny. Such an agreement wouldbe illegal, seeing that the true Congress of Peasants' Soviets doesnot meet until next week...."Moreover, I want to warn you now that the Bolsheviki will neveraccept your demands...."He was interrupted by a great burst of laughter; and realising thesituation, he left the platform and the room, taking his popularitywith him....Late in the afternoon of Thursday, November 16th, the Congress metin extraordinary session. There was a holiday feeling in the air; onevery face was a smile.... The remainder of the business before theassembly was hurried through, and then old Nathanson, thewhite-bearded dean of the left wing of the SocialistRevolutionaries, his voice trembling and tears in his eyes, read thereport of the "wedding" of the Peasants' Soviets with the Workers'and Soldiers' Soviets. At every mention of the word "union" therewas ecstatic applause.... At the end Ustinov announced the arrivalrival of a delegation from Smolny, accompanied by representatives ofthe Red Army, greeted with a rising ovation. One after another aworkman, a soldier and a sailor took the floor, hailing them.Then Boris Reinstein, delegate of the American Socialist LaborParty: "The day of the union of the Congress of Peasants and theSoviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies is one of the great daysof the Revolution. The sound of it will ring with resounding echoesthroughout the whole world-in Paris, in London, and across theocean-in New York. This union will fill with happiness the hearts ofall toilers."A great idea has triumphed. The West, and America, expected fromRussia, from the Russian proletariat, something tremendous.... Theproletariat of the world is waiting for the Russian Revolution,waiting for the great things that it is accomplishing...."Sverdlov, president of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ greeted them. And with theshout, "Long live the end of civil war! Long live the UnitedDemocracy!" the peasants poured out of the building.It was already dark, and on the ice-covered snow glittered the palelight of moon and star. Along the bank of the canal were drawn up infull marching order the soldiers of the Pavlovsky Regiment, withtheir band, which broke into the _Marseillaise._ Amid the crashingfull-throated shouts of the soldiers, the peasants formed in line,unfurling the great red banner of the Executive Committee of theAll-Russian Peasants' Soviets, embroidered newly in gold, "Long livethe union of the revolutionary and toiling masses!" Following wereother banners; of the District Soviets-of Putilov Factory, whichread, "We bow to this flag in order to create the brotherhood of allpeople!"From somewhere torches appeared, blazing orange in the night, athousand times reflected in the facets of the ice, streaming outsmokily over the throng as it moved down the bank of the Fontankasinging, between crowds that stood in astonished silence."Long live the Revolutionary Army! Long live the Red Guard! Longlive the Peasants!"So the great procession wound through the city, growing andunfurling ever new red banners lettered in gold. Two old peasants,bowed with toil, were walking hand in hand, their faces illuminedwith child-like bliss."Well," said one, "I'd like to see them take away our land again,_now!_Near Smolny the Red Guard was lined up on both sides of the street,wild with delight. The other old peasant spoke to his comrade, "I amnot tired," he said. "I walked on air all the way!"On the steps of Smolny about a hundred Workers' and Soldiers'Deputies were massed, with their banner, dark against the blaze oflight streaming out between the arches. Like a wave they rusheddown, clasping the peasants in their arms and kissing them; and theprocession poured in through the great door and up the stairs, witha noise like thunder....In the immense white meeting-room the _Tsay-ee-kah_ was waiting,with the whole Petrograd Soviet and a thousand spectators beside,with that solemnity which attends great conscious moments in history.Zinoviev announced the agreement with the Peasants' Congress, to ashaking roar which rose and burst into storm as the sound of musicblared down the corridor, and the head of the procession came in. Onthe platform the presidium rose and made place for the Peasants'presidium, the two embracing; behind them the two banners wereintertwined against the white wall, over the empty frame from whichthe Tsar's picture had been torn....Then opened the "triumphal session." After a few words of welcomefrom Sverdlov, Maria Spiridonova, slight, pale, with spectacles andhair drawn flatly down, and the air of a New England school-teacher,took the tribune-the most loved and the most powerful woman in allRussia."... Before the workers of Russia open now horizons which history hasnever known.... All workers' movements in the past have been defeated.But the present movement is international, and that is why it isinvincible. There is no force in the world which can put out thefire of the Revolution! The old world crumbles down, the new worldbegins...."Then Trotzky, full of fire: "I wish you welcome, comrades peasants!You come here not as guests, but as masters of this house, whichholds the heart of the Russian Revolution. The will of millions ofworkers is now concentrated in this hall.... There is now only onemaster of the Russian land: the union of the workers, soldiers andpeasants...."With biting sarcasm he went on to speak of the Allied diplomats,till then contemptuous of Russia's invitation to an armistice, whichhad been accepted by the Central Powers."A new humanity will be born of this war.... In this hall we swear toworkers of all lands to remain at our revolutionary post. If we arebroken, then it will be in defending our flag...."Krylenko followed him, explaining the situation at the front, whereDukhonin was preparing to resist the Council of People's Commissars."Let Dukhonin and those with him understand well that we shall notdeal gently with those who bar the road to peace!"Dybenko saluted the assembly in the name of the Fleet, andKrushinsky, member of the _Vikzhel,_ said, "From this moment, whenthe union of all true Socialists is realised, the whole army ofrailway workers places itself absolutely at the disposition of therevolutionary democracy!" And Lunatcharsky, almost weeping, andProshian, for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, and finallySaharashvili, for the United Social Democrats Internationalists,composed of members of the Martov's and of Gorky's groups, whodeclared:"We left the _Tsay-ee-kah_ because of the uncompromising policy ofthe Bolsheviki, and to force them to make concessions in order torealise the union of all the revolutionary democracy. Now that thatunion is brought about, we consider it a sacred duty to take ourplaces once more in the _Tsay-ee-kah_.... We declare that all thosewho have withdrawn from the _Tsay-ee-kah_ should now return."Stachkov, a dignified old peasant of the presidium of the Peasants'Congress, bowed to the four corners of the room. "I greet you withthe christening of a new Russian life and freedom!"Gronsky, in the name of the Polish Social Democracy; Skripnik, forthe Factory-Shop Committees; Tifonov, for the Russian soldiers atSalonika; and others, interminably, speaking out of full hearts,with the happy eloquence of hopes fulfilled....It was late in the night when the following resolution was put andpassed unanimously:"The _Tsay-ee-kah,_ united in extraordinary session with thePetrograd Soviet and the Peasants' Congress, confirms the Land andPeace decrees adopted by the second Congress of Soviets of Workers'and Soldiers' Deputies, and also the decree on Workers' Controladopted by the _Tsay-ee-kah._"The joint session of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and the Peasants' Congressexpresses its firm conviction that the union of workers, soldiersand peasants, this fraternal union of all the workers and allexploited, will consolidate the power conquered by them, that itwill take all revolutionary measures to hasten the passing of thepower into the hands of the working-class in other countries, andthat it will assure in this manner the lasting accomplishment of ajust peace and the victory of Socialism."(See App. XI, Sect. 2)                        APPENDIX TO CHAPTER I                                 1._Oborontsi_—“Defenders.” All the “moderate” Socialist groups adoptedor were given this name, because they consented to the continuationof the war under Allied leadership, on the ground that it was a warof National Defence. The Bolsheviki, the Left SocialistRevolutionaries, the Mensheviki Internationalists (Martov’s faction),and the Social Democrats Internationalists (Gorky’s group) were infavour of forcing the Allies to declare democratic war-aims, and tooffer peace to Germany on those terms….                                  2.

On an average, wagesincreased slightly more than 500 per cent….But at the same time the value of the ruble fell to less thanone-third its former purchasing power, and the cost of thenecessities of

         |+-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+On an average, the above categories of necessities increased about1,109 per cent in price, more than twice the increase of salaries.The difference, of course, went into the pockets of speculators andmerchants.In September, 1917, when I arrived in Petrograd, the average dailywage of a skilled industrial worker—for example, a steel-worker inthe Putilov Factory—was about 8 rubles. At the same time, profitswere enormous…. I was told by one of the owners of the ThorntonWoollen Mills, an English concern on the outskirts of Petrograd, thatwhile wages had increased about 300 per cent in his factory, hisprofits had gone up _900 per cent._                                 3.                        THE SOCIALIST MINISTERSThe history of the efforts of the Socialists in the ProvisionalGovernment of July to realise their programme in coalition with thebourgeois Ministers, is an illuminating example of class struggle inpolitics. Says Lenin, in explanation of this phenomenon:“The capitalists, … seeing that the position of the Government wasuntenable, resorted to a method which since 1848 has been for decadespractised by the capitalists in order to befog, divide, and finallyoverpower the working-class. This method is the so-called ‘CoalitionMinistry,’ composed of bourgeois and of renegades from the Socialistcamp.“In those countries where political freedom and democracy haveexisted side by side with the revolutionary movement of theworkers—for example in England and France—the capitalists make use ofthis subterfuge, and very successfully too. The ‘Socialist’ leaders,upon entering the Ministries, invariably prove mere figure-heads,puppets, simply a shield for the capitalists, a tool with which todefraud the workers. The ‘democratic’ and ‘republican’ capitalists inRussia set in motion this very same scheme. The SocialistRevolutionaries and Mensheviki fell victim to it, and on June 1st a‘Coalition’ Ministry, with the participation of Tchernov, Tseretelli,Skobeliev, Avksentiev, Savinkov, Zarudny and Nikitin became anaccomplished fact….”—_Problems of the Revolution._                                 4.                SEPTEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN MOSCOWIn the first week of October, 1917, _Novaya Zhizn_ published thefollowing comparative table of election results, pointing out thatthis meant the bankruptcy of the policy of Coalition with thepropertied classes. “If civil war can yet be avoided, it can only bedone by a united front of all the revolutionary democracy….”_Elections for the Moscow Central and Ward Dumas_.

GROWING ARROGANCE OF THE REACTIONARIESSeptember 18th. The Cadet Shulgin, writing in a Kiev newspaper, saidthat the Provisional Government’s declaration that Russia was aRepublic constituted a gross abuse of its powers. “We cannot admiteither a Republic, or the present Republican Government…. And we arenot sure that we want a Republic in Russia….”October 23d. At a meeting of the Cadet party held at Riazan, M.Dukhonin declared, “On March 1st we must establish a ConstitutionalMonarchy. We must not reject the legitimate heir to the throne,Mikhail Alexandrovitch….”October 27th. Resolution passed by the Conference of Business Men atMoscow:“The Conference… insists that the Provisional Government take thefollowing immediate measures in the Army:“1. Forbidding of all political propaganda; the Army must be out ofpolitics.“2. Propaganda of antinational and international ideas and theoriesdeny the necessity for armies, and hurt discipline; it should beforbidden, and all propagandists punished….“3. The function of the Army Committees must be limited to economicquestions exclusively. All their decisions should be confirmed bytheir superior officers, who have the right to dissolve theCommittees at any time….“4. The salute to be reestablished, and made obligatory. Fullreestablishment of disciplinary power in the hands of officers, withright of review of sentence….“5. Expulsion from the Corps of Officers of those who dishonour it byparticipating in the movement of the soldier-masses, which teachesthem disobedience…. Reestablishment for this purpose of the Courts ofHonor….“6. The Provisional Government should take the necessary measures tomake possible the return to the army of Generals and other officersunjustly discharged under the influence of Committees, and otherirresponsible organisations….”                       APPENDIX TO CHAPTER II                                 1.The Kornilov revolt is treated in detail in my forthcoming volume,“Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk.” The responsibility of Kerensky for thesituation which gave rise to Kornilov’s attempt is now pretty clearlyestablished. Many apologists for Kerensky say that he knew ofKornilov’s plans, and by a trick drew him out prematurely, and thencrushed him. Even Mr. A. J. Sack, in his book, “The Birth of theRussian Democracy,” says:“Several things… are almost certain. The first is that Kerensky knewabout the movement of several detachments from the Front towardPetrograd, and it is possible that as Prime Minister and Minister ofWar, realising the growing Bolshevist danger, he called for them….”The only flaw in that argument is that there was no “Bolshevistdanger” at that time, the Bolsheviki still being a powerless minorityin the Soviets, and their leaders in jail or hiding.                                 2.                        DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCEWhen the Democratic Conference was first proposed to Kerensky, hesuggested an assembly of all the elements in the nation—“the liveforces,” as he called them—including bankers, manufacturers,land-owners, and representatives of the Cadet party. The Sovietrefused, and drew up the following table of representation, whichKerensky agreed to:+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 100 delegates | All-Russian Soviets Workers’ and Soldiers’         ||               | Deputies                                           |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 100 delegates | All-Russian Soviets Peasants’ Deputies             |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 50 delegates  | Provincial Soviets Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 50 delegates  | Peasants’ District Land Committees                 |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 100 delegates | Trade Unions                                       |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 84 delegates  | Army Committees at the Front                       |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 150 delegates | Workers’ and Peasants’ Cooperative Societies       |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 20 delegates  | Railway Workers’ Union                             |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 10 delegates  | Post and Telegraph Workers’ Union                  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 20 delegates  | Commercial Clerks                                  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 15 delegates  | Liberal Professions—Doctors, Lawyers,              ||               | Journalists, etc.                                  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 50 delegates  | Provincial Zemstvos                                |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+| 59 delegates  | Nationalist Organisations—Poles, Ukraineans, etc.  |+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+This proportion was altered twice or three times.

THE FUNCTION OF THE SOVIETS IS ENDEDOn September 28th, 1917, _Izviestia,_ organ of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_published an article which said, speaking of the last ProvisionalMinistry:“At last a truly democratic government, born of the will of allclasses of the Russian people, the first rough form of the futureliberal parliamentary régime, has been formed. Ahead of us is theConstituent Assembly, which will solve all questions of fundamentallaw, and whose composition will be essentially democratic. Thefunction of the Soviets is at an end, and the time is approachingwhen they must retire, with the rest of the revolutionary machinery,from the stage of a free and victorious people, whose weapons shallhereafter be the peaceful ones of political action.”The leading article of _Izviestia_ for October 23d was called, “TheCrisis in the Soviet Organisations.” It began by saying thattravellers reported a lessening activity of local Soviets everywhere.“This is natural,” said the writer. “For the people are becominginterested in the more permanent legislative organs—the MunicipalDumas and the Zemstvs….“In the important centres of Petrograd and Moscow, where the Sovietswere best organised, they did not take in all the democraticelements…. The majority of the intellectuals did not participate, andmany workers also; some of the workers because they were politicallybackward, others because the centre of gravity for them was in theirUnns…. We cannot deny that these organisations are firmly united withthe masses, whose everyday needs are better served by them….“That the local democratic administrations are being energeticallyorganised is highly important. The City Dumas are elected byuniversal suffrage, and in purely local matters have more authoritythan the Soviets. Not a single democrat will see anything wrong inthis….“… Elections to the Municipalities are being conduct in a better andmore democratic way than the elections to the Soviets… All classesare represented in the Municipalities…. And as soon as the localSelf-Governments begin to organise life in the Municipalities, therôle of the local Soviets naturally ends….“… There are two factors in the falling off of interest in theSoviets. The first we may attribute to the lowering of politicalinterest in the masses; the second, to the growing effort ofprovincial and local governing bodies to organise the building of newRussia…. The more the tendency lies in this latter direction, thesooner disappears the significance of the Soviets….“We ourselves are being called the ‘undertakers’ of our ownorganisation. In reality, we ourselves are the hardest workers inconstructing the new Russia….“When autocracy and the whole bureaucratic règimeell, we set up theSoviets as a barracks in which all the democracy cod find temporaryshelter. Now, instead of barracks, we are building the permanentedifice of a new system, and naturally the people will graduallyleave the barracks for more comfortable quarters.”                                 4.        TROTZKY’S SPEECH AT THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIN REPUBLIC“The purpose of the Democratic Conference, which was called by the_Tsay-ee-kah,_ was to do away with the irresponsible personalgovernment which produced Kornilov, and to establish a responsiblegovernment which would be capable of finishing the war, and ensurethe calling of the Constituent Assembly at the given time. In themeanwhile behind the back of the Democratic Conference, by trickery,by deals between Citizen Kerensky, the Cadets, and the leaders of theMenshevik and Socialist Revolutionary parties, we received theopposite result from the officially announced purpose. A power wascreated around which and in which we have open and secret Kornilovsplaying leading parts. The irresponsibility of the Government isoffically proclaimed, when it is announced that the Council of theRussian Republic is to be a _consultative_ and not _legislative_body. In the eighth month of the Revolution, the irresponsibleGovernment creates a cover for itself in this new edition ofBieligen’s Duma.“The propertied classes have entered this Provision Council in aproportion which clearly shows, from elections all over the country,that many of them have no right here whatever. In spite of that theCadet party, which until yesterday wanted the Provisional Governmentto be responsible to the State Duma—this same Cadet party secured theindependence Assembly the propertied classes will no doubt have asfavourable position than they have in this Council, and they will notbe able to be irresponsible to the Constituent Assembly.“If the propertied classes were really getting ready for theConstituent Assembly six weeks from now, there could be no reason forestablishing the irresponsibility of the Government at this time. Thewhole truth is that the bourgeoisie, which directs the policies ofthe Provisional Government, has for its aim to break the ConstituentAssembly. At present this is the main purpose of the propertiedclasses, which control our entire national policy—external andinternal. In the industrial, agrarian and supply departments thepolitics of the propertied classes, acting with the Government,increases the natural disorganisation caused by the war. Thepropertied classes, which are provoking a peasants’ revolt! Thepropertied classes, which are provoking civil war, and openly holdtheir course on the bony hand of hunger, with which they intend tooverthrow the Revolution and finish with the Constituent Assembly!“No less criminal also is the international policy of the bourgeoisieand its Government. After forty months of war, the capital isthreatened with mortal danger. In reply to this arises a plan to movethe Government to Moscow. The idea of abandoning the capital does notstir the indignation of the bourgeoisie. Just the opposite. It isaccepted as a natural part of the general policy designed to promotecounter-revolutionary conspiracy. … Instead of recognising that thesalvation of the country lies in concluding peace, instead ofthrowing openly the idea of immediate peace to all the worn-outpeoples, over the heads of diplomats and imperialists, and making thecontinuation of the war impossible,—the Provisional Government, byorder of the Cadets, the Counter-Revolutionists and the AlliedImperialists, without sense, without purpose and without a plan,continues to drag on the murderous war, sentencing to useless deathnew hundreds of thousands of soldiers and sailors, and preparing togive up Petrograd, and to wreck the Revolution. At a time whenBolshevik soldiers and sailors are dying with other soldiers andsailors as a result of the mistakes and crimes of others, theso-called Supreme Commander (Kerensky) continues to suppress theBolshevik press. The leading parties of the Council are acting as avoluntary cover for these policies.“We, the faction of Social Democrats Bolsheviki, announce that withthis Government of Treason to the People we have nothing in common.We have nothing in common with the work of these Murderers of thePeople which goes on behind official curtains. We refuse eitherdirectly or indirectly to cover up one day of this work. WhileWilhelm’s troops are threatening Petrograd, the Government ofKerensky and Kornilov is preparing to run away from Petrograd andturn Moscow into a base of counter-revolution!“We warn the Moscow workers and soldiers to be on their guard.Leaving this Council, we appeal to the manhood and wisdom of theworkers, peasants and soldiers of all Russia. Petrograd is in danger!The Revolution is in danger! The Government has increased thedanger—the ruling classes intensify it. Only the people themselvescan save themselves and the country.“We appeal to the people. Long live immediate, honest, democraticpeace! All power to the Soviets! All land to the people! Long livethe Constituent Assembly!”                                 5.                        THE “NAKAZ” TO SKOBELIEV                                _Resumé_(Passed by the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and given to Skobeliev as an instructionfor the representative of the Russian Revolutionary democracy at theParis Conference.)The peace treaty must be based on the principle, “No annexations, noindemnities, the right of self-determination of peoples.”                _Territorial Problems_(1) Evacuation of German troops from invaded Russia. Full right ofself-determination to Poland, Lithuania and Livonia.(2) For Turkish Armenia autonomy, and later completeself-determination, as soon as local Governments are established.(3) The question of Alsace-Lorraine to be solved by a plebiscite,after the withdrawal of all foreign troops.(4) Belgium to be restored. Compensation for damages from aninternational fund.(5) Serbia and Montenegro to be restored, and aided by aninternational relief fund. Serbia to have an outlet on the Adriatic.Bosnia and Herzegovina to be autonomous.(6) The disputed provinces in the Balkans to have provisionalautonomy, followed by a plebiscite.(7) Rumania to be restored, but forced to give completeself-determination to the Dobrudja…. Rumania must be forced toexecute the clauses of the Berlin Treaty concerning the Jews, andrecognise them as Rumanian citizens.(8) In Italia Irridenta a provisional autonomy, followed by aplebiscite to determine state dependence.(9) The German colonies to be returned.(10) Greece and Persia to be restored.                _Freedom of the Seas_All straits opening into inland seas, as well as the Suez and PanamaCanals, are to be neutralised. Commercial shipping to be free. Theright of privateering to be abolished. The torpedoing of commercialships to be forbidden.                _Indemnities_All combatants to renounce demands for any indemnities, either director indirect—as, for instance, charges for the maintenance ofprisoners. Indemnities and contributions collected during the warmust be refunded.                _Economic Terms_Commercial treaties are not to be a part of the peace terms. Everycountry must be independent in its commercial relations, and must notbe obliged to, or prevented from, concluding an economic treaty, bythe Treaty of Peace. Nevertheless, all nations should bindthemselves, by the Peace Treaty, not to practise an economic blockadeafter the war, nor to form separate tariff agreements. The right ofmost favoured nation must be given to all countries withoutdistinction.                _Guarantees of Peace_Peace is to be concluded at the Peace Conference by delegates electedby the national representative institutions of each country. Thepeace terms are to be confirmed by these parliaments.Secret diplomacy is to be abolished; all parties are to bindthemselves not to conclude any secret treaties. Such treaties aredeclared in contradiction to international law, and void. Alltreaties, until confirmed by the parliaments of the differentnations, are to be considered void.Gradual disarmament both on land and sea, and the establishment of amilitia system. The “League of Nations” advanced by President Wilsonmay become a valuable aid to international law, provided that (a),all nations are to be obliged to participate in it with equal rights,and (b), international politics are to be democratised.                _Ways to Peace_The Allies are to announce immediately that they are willing to openpeace negotiations as soon as the enemy powers declare their consentto the renunciation of all forcible annexations.The Allies must bind themselves not to begin any peace negotiations,nor to conclude peace, except in a general Peace Conference with theparticipation of delegates from all the neutral countries.All obstacles to the Stockholm Socialist Conference are to beremoved, and passports are to be given immediately to all delegatesof parties and organisations who wish to participate.(The Executive Committee of the Peasants’ Soviets also issued a_nakaz,_ which differs little from the above.)                                 6.                        PEACE AT RUSSIA’S EXPENSEThe Ribot revelations of Austria’s peace-offer to France; theso-called “Peace Conference” at Berne, Switzerland, during the summerof 1917, in which delegates participated from all belligerentcountries, representing large financial interests in all thesecountries; and the attempted negotiations of an English agent with aBulgarian church dignitary; all pointed to the fact that there werestrong currents, on both sides, favourable to patching up a peace atthe expense of Russia. In my next book, “Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk,”I intend to treat this matter at some length, publishing severalsecret documents discovered in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs atPetrograd.                                 7.                     RUSSIAN SOLDIERS IN FRANCE_Official Report of the Provisional Government._“From the time the news of the Russian Revolution reached Paris,Russian newspapers of extreme tendencies immediately began to appear;and these newspapers, as well as individuals, freely circulated amongthe soldier masses and began a Bolshevik propaganda, often spreadingfalse news which appeared in the French journals. In the absence ofall official news, and of precise details, this campaign provokeddiscontent among the soldiers. The result was a desire to return toRussia, and a hatred toward the officers.“Finally it all turned into rebellion. In one of their meetings, thesoldiers issued an appeal to refuse to drill, since they had decidedto fight no more. It was decided to isolate the rebels, and GeneralZankievitch ordered all soldiers loyal to the Provisional Governmentto leave the camp of Courtine, and to carry with them all ammunition.On June 25th the order was executed; there remained at the camp onlythe soldiers who said they would submit ‘conditionally’ to theProvisional Government. The soldiers at the camp of Courtine receivedseveral times the visit of the Commander-in-Chief of the RussianArmies abroad, of Rapp, the Commissar of the Ministry of War, and ofseveral distinguished former exiles who wished to influence them, butthese attempts were unsuccessful, and finally Commissar Rapp insistedthat the rebels lay down their arms, and, in sign of submission,march in good order to a place called Clairvaux. The order was onlypartially obeyed; first 500 men went out, of whom 22 were arrested;24 hours later about 6,000 followed…. About 2,000 remained….“It was decided to increase the pressure; their rations werediminished, their pay was cut off, and the roads toward the villageof Courtine were guarded by French soldiers. General Zankievitch,having discovered that a Russian artillery brigade was passingthrough France, decided to form a mixed detachment of infantry andartillery to reduce the rebels. A deputation  was sent to the rebels;the deputation returned several hours later, convinced of thefutility of the negotiations. On September 1st General Zankievitchsent an ultimatum to the rebels demanding that they lay down theirarms, and menacing in case of refusal to open fire with artillery ifthe order was not obeyed by September 3d at 10 o’clock.“The order not being executed, a light fire of artillery was openedon the place at the hour agreed upon. Eighteen shells were fired, andthe rebels were warned that the bombardment would become moreintense. In the night of September 3d 160 men surrendered. September4th the artillery bombardment recommenced, and at 11 o’clock, after36 shells had been fired, the rebels raised two white flags and beganto leave the camp without arms. By evening 8,300 men had surrendered.150 soldiers who remained in the camp opened fire with machine-gunsthat night. The 5th of September, to make an end of the affair, aheavy barrage was laid on the camp, and our soldiers occupied itlittle by little. The rebels kept up a heavy fire with theirmachine-guns. September 6th, at 9 o’clock, the camp was entirelyoccupied…. After the disarmament of the rebels, 81 arrests weremade….”Thus the report. From secret documents discovered in the Ministry ofForeign Affairs, however, we know that the account is not strictlyaccurate. The first trouble arose when the soldiers tried to formCommittees, as their comrades in Russia were doing. They demanded tobe sent back to Russia, which was refused; and then, being considereda dangerous influence in France, they were ordered to Salonika. Theyrefused to go, and the battle followed…. It was discovered that theyhad been left in camp without officers for about two months, andbadly treated, before they became rebellious. All attempts to findout the name of the “Russian artillery brigade” which had fired onthem were futile; the telegrams discovered in the Ministry left it tobe inferred that French artillery was used….After their surrender, more than two hundred of the mutineers wereshot in cold blood.                                 8.                      TERESTCHENKO’S SPEECH_ (Resumé_)“… The questions of foreign policy are closely related to those ofnational defence…. And so, if in questions of national defence youthink it is necessary to hold session in secret, also in our foreignpolicy we are sometimes forced to observe the same secrecy….“German diplomacy attempts to influence public opinion…. Thereforethe declarations of directors of great democratic organisations whotalk loudly of a revolutionary Congress, and the impossibility ofanother winter campaign, are dangerous…. All these declarations costhuman lives….“I wish to speak merely of governmental logic, without touching thequestions of the honour and dignity of the State. From the point ofview of logic, the foreign policy of Russia ought to be based on areal comprehension of the _interests_ of Russia…. These interestsmean that it is impossible that our country remain alone, and thatthe present alignment of forces with us, (the Allies), issatisfactory…. All humanity longs for peace, but in Russia no onewill permit a humiliating peace which would violate the Stateinterests of our fatherland!”The orator pointed out that such a peace would for long years, if notfor centuries, retard the triumph of democratic principles in theworld, and would inevitably cause new wars.“All remember the days of May, when the fraternisation on our Frontthreatened to end the war by a simple cessation of militaryoperations, and lead the country to a shameful separate peace… andwhat efforts it was necessary to use to make the soldier masses atthe front understand that it was not by this method that the RussianState must end the war and guarantee its interest….”He spoke of the miraculous effect of the July offensive, whatstrength it gave to the words of Russian ambassadors abroad, and thedespair in Germany caused by the Russian victories. And also, thedisillusionment in Allied countries which followed the Russiandefeat….“As to the Russian Government, it adhered strictly to the formula ofMay, ‘No annexations and no punitive indemnities.’ We consider itessential not only to proclaim the self-determination of peoples, butalso to renounce imperialist aims….”Germany is continually trying to make peace. The only talk in Germanyis of peace; she knows she cannot win.“I reject the reproaches aimed at the Government which allege thatRussian foreign policy does not speak clearly enough about the aimsof the war….“If the question arises as to what ends the Allies are pursuing, itis indispensable first to demand what aims the Central Powers haveagreed upon….“The desire is often heard that we publish the details of thetreaties which bind the Allies; but people forget that, up to now, wedo not know the treaties which bind the Central Powers….”Germany, he said, evidently wants to separate Russia from the West bya series of weak buffer-states.“This tendency to strike at the vital interests of Russia must bechecked….“And will the Russian democracy, which has inscribed on its bannerthe rights of nations to dispose of themselves, allow calmly thecontinuation of oppression upon the most civilised peoples (inAustria-Hungary)?“Those who fear that the Allies will try to profit by our difficultsituation, to make us support more than our share of the burden ofwar, and to solve the questions of peace at our expense, are entirelymistaken…. Our enemy looks upon Russia as a market for its products.The end of the war will leave us in a feeble condition, and with ourfrontier open the flood of German products can easily hold back foryears our industrial development. Measures must be taken to guardagainst this….“I say openly and frankly: the combination of forces which unites usto the Allies is _favourable to the interests of Russia…._ It istherefore important that our views on the questions of war and peaceshall be in accord with the views of the Allies as clearly andprecisely as possible…. To avoid all misunderstanding, I must sayfrankly that Russia must present at the Paris Conference _one pointof view…._”He did not want to comment on the _nakaz_ to Skobeliev, but hereferred to the Manifesto of the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee, justpublished in Stockholm. This Manifesto declared for the autonomy ofLithuania and Livonia; “but that is clearly impossible,” saidTerestchenko, “for Russia must have free ports on the Baltic all theyear round….“In this question the problems of foreign policy are also closelyrelated to interior politics, for if there existed a strong sentimentof unity of all great Russia, one would not witness the repeatedmanifestations, everywhere, of a desire of peoples to separate fromthe Central Government…. Such separations are contrary to theinterests of Russia, and the Russian delegates cannot raise theissue….”                                 9.                       THE BRITISH FLEET (_etc._)At the time of the naval battle of the Gulf of Riga, not only theBolsheviki, but also the Ministers of the Provisional Government,considered  that the British Fleet had deliberately abandoned theBaltic, as one indication of the attitude so often expressed publiclyby the British press, and semi-publicly by British representatives inRussia, “Russia’s finished! No use bothering about Russia!”See interview with Kerensky (Appendix 13).GENERAL GURKO was a former Chief of Staff of the Russian armies underthe Tsar. He was a prominent figure in the corrupt Imperial Court.After the Revolution, he was one of the very few persons exiled forhis political and personal record. The Russian naval defeat in theGulf of Riga coincided with the public reception, by King George inLondon, of General Gurko, a man whom the Russian ProvisionalGovernment considered dangerously pro-German as well as reactionary!                                10.                     APPEALS AGAINST INSURRECTION                        _To Workers and Soldiers_“Comrades! The Dark Forces are increasingly trying to call forth inPetrograd and other towns DISORDERS AND _Pogroms._ Disorder isnecessary to the Dark Forces, for disorder will give them anopportunity for crushing the revolutionary movement in blood. Underthe pretext of establishing order, and of protecting the inhabitants,they hope to establish the domination of Kornilov, which therevolutionary people succeeded in suppressing not long ago. Woe tothe people if these hopes are realised! The triumphantcounter-revolution will destroy the Soviets and the Army Committees,will disperse the Constituent Assembly, will stop the transfer of theland to the Land Committees, will put an end to all the hopes of thepeople for a speedy peace, and will fill all the prisons withrevolutionary soldiers and workers.“In their calculations, the counter-revolutionists and Black Hundredleaders are counting on the serious discontent of the unenlightenedpart of the people with the disorganisation of the food-supply, thecontinuation of the war, and the general difficulties of life. Theyhope to transform every demonstration of soldiers and workers into a_pogrom,_ which will frighten the peaceful population and throw itinto the arms of the Restorers of Law and Order.“Under such conditions every attempt to organise a demonstration inthese days, although for the most laudable object, would be a crime.All conscious workers and soldiers who are displeased with the policyof the Government will only bring injury to themselves and to theRevolution if they indulge in demonstrations.“THEREFORE THE _Tsay-ee-kah_ ASKS ALL WORKERS NOT TO OBEY ANY CALLSTO DEMONSTRATE.“WORKERS AND SOLDIERS! DO NOT YIELD TO PROVOCATION! REMEMBER YOURDUTY TO YOUR COUNTRY AND TO THE REVOLUTION! DO NOT BREAK THE UNITY OFTHE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT BY DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH ARE BOUND TO BEUNSUCCESSFUL!”_The Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Workers’ andSoldiers’ Deputies (Tsay-ee-kah)__Russian Social Democratic Labour Party_THE DANGER IS NEAR!To All Workers and Soldiers(_Read and Hand to Others_)_Comrades Workers and Soldiers!_“Our country is in danger. On account of this danger our freedom andour Revolution are passing through difficult days. The enemy is atthe gates of Petrograd. The disorganisation is growing with everyhours. It becomes more and more difficult to obtain bread forPetrograd. All, of from the smallest to the greatest, must redoubletheir efforts, must endeavour to arrange things properly…. We mustsave our country, say freedom…. More arms and provisions for theArmy! Bread—for the great cities. Order and organisation in thecountry….“And in these terrible critical days rumours creep about thatSOMEWHERE a demonstration is being prepared, that SOME ONE is callingon the soldiers and workers to destroy revolutionary peace andorder…. _Rabotchi Put,_ the newspaper of the Bolsheviki, is pouringoil on the flames: it flattering, trying to please the unenlightenedpeople, tempting the worker and soldiers, urging them on against theGovernment, promising them mountains of good things…. The confiding,ignorant men believe, they do not reason…. And from the other sidecome also rumours—rumours that the Dark Forces, the friends of theTsar, the German spies, are rubbing their hands with glee. They areready to join the Bolsheviki, and with them fan the disorders intocivil war.“The Bolsheviki and the ignorant soldiers and workers seduced by themcry senselessly: ‘Down with the Government! All power to theSoviets!’ And the Dark servants of the Tsar and the spies of Wilhelmwill egg the on; ‘Beat the Jews, beat the shopkeepers, rob themarkets, devastate the shops, pillage the wine stores! Slay, burn,rob!’“And then will begin a terrible confusion, a war between one part ofthe people and the other. All will become still more disorganised,and perhaps once more blood will be shed on the streets of thecapital. And then what then?“Then, the road to Petrograd will be open to Wilhelm. Then, no breadwill come to Petrograd, the children will die of hunger. Then, theArmy as the front will remain without support, our brothers in thetrenches will be delivered to the fire of the enemy. Then, Russiawill lose all prestige in other countries, our money will lose itsvalue; everything will be so dear as to make life impossible. Then,the long awaited Constituent Assembly will be postponed—it will beimpossible to convene it in time. And then—Death to the Revolution,Death to our Liberty….“Is it this that you want, workers and soldiers? No! If you do notthen go, go to the ignorant people seduced by the betrayers, and tellthem the whole truth, which we have told you!“Let all know that EVERY MAN WHO IN THESE TERRIBLE DAYS CALLS ON YOUTO COME OUT IN THE STREETS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, IS EITHER A SECRETSERVANT OF THE TSAR, A PROVOCATOR, OR AN UNWISE ASSISTANT OF THEENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE, OR A PAID SPY OF WILHELM!“Every conscious worker revolutionist, every conscious peasant, everyrevolutionary soldier, all who understand what harm a demonstrationor a revolt against the Government might cause to the people, mustjoin together and not allow the enemies of the people to destroy ourfreedom.”_The Petrograd Electoral Committee of the Mensheviki-oborontzi._                                11.                    LENIN’s “LETTER TO THE COMRADES”This series of articles appeared in _Rabotchi Put_ several daysrunning, at the end of October and beginning of November, 1917. Igive here only extracts from two instalments:1. Kameniev and Riazanov say that we have not a majority among thepeople, and that without a majority insurrection is hopeless.“Answer: People capable of speaking such things are falsifiers,pedants, or simply don’t want to look the real situation in the face.In the last elections we received in all the country more than fiftyper cent of all thevotes….“The most important thing in Russia to-day is the peasants’revolution. In Tambov Government there has been a real agrarianuprising with wonderful political results…. Even _Dielo Naroda_ hasbeen scared into yelling that the land must be turned over to thepeasants, and not only the Socialist Revolutionaries in the Councilof the Republic, but also the Government itself, has been similarlyaffected. Another valuable result was the bringing of bread which hadbeen hoarded by the _pomieshtchiki_ to the railroad stations in thatprovince. The _Russkaya Volia_ had to admit that the stations werefilled with bread after the peasants’ rising….“2. We are not sufficiently strong to take over the Government, andthe bourgeoisie is not sufficiently strong to prevent the ConstituentAssembly.“Answer: This is nothing but timidity, expressed by pessimism asregards workers and soldiers, and optimism as regards the failure ofthe bourgeoisie. If _yunkers_ and Cossacks say they will fight, youbelieve them; if workmen and soldiers say so, you doubt it. What isthe distinction between such doubts and siding politically with thebourgeoisie?“Kornilov proved that the Soviets were really a power. To believeKerensky and the Council of the Republic, if the bourgeoisie is notstrong enough to break the Soviets, it is not strong enough to breakthe Constituent. But that is wrong. The bourgeoisie will break theConstituent by sabotage, by lock-outs, by giving up Petrograd, byopening the front to the Germans. This has already been done in thecase of Riga….“3. The Soviets must remain a revolver at the head of the Governmentto force the calling of the Constituent Assembly, and to suppress anyfurther Kornilov attempts.“Answer: Refusal of insurrection is refusal of ‘All Power to theSoviets.’ Since September the Bolshevik party has been discussing thequestion of insurrection. Refusing to rise means to trust our hopesin the faith of the good bourgeoisie, who have ‘promised’ to call theConstituent Assembly. When the Soviets have all the power, thecalling of the Constituent is guaranteed, and its success assured.“Refusal of insurrection means surrender to the ‘Lieber-Dans.’ Eitherwe must drop ‘All Power to the Soviets’ or make an insurrection;there is no middle course.”“4. The bourgeoisie cannot give up Petrograd, although the Rodziankoswant it, because it is not the bourgeoisie who are fighting, but ourheroic soldiers and sailors.“Answer: This did not prevent two admirals from running away at theMoonsund battle. The Staff has not changed; it is composed ofKornilovtsi. If the Staff, with Kerensky at its head, wants to giveup Petrograd, it can do it doubly or trebly. It can make arrangementswith the Germans or the British; open the fronts. It can sabotage theArmy’s food supply. At all these doors has it knocked.“We have no right to wait until the bourgeoisie chokes theRevolution. Rodzianko is a man of action, who has faithfully andtruthfully served the bourgeoisie for years…. Half the Lieber-Dansare cowardly compromisers; half of them simple fatalists….”“5. We’re getting stronger every day. We shall be able to enter theConstituent Assembly as a strong opposition. Then why should we playeverything on one card?”“Answer: This is the argument of a sophomore with no practicalexperience, who reads that the Constituent Assembly is being calledand trustfully accepts the legal and constitutional way. Even thevoting of the Constituent Assembly will not do away with hunger, orbeat Wilhelm…. The issue of hunger and of surrendering Petrogradcannot be decided by waiting for the Constituent Assembly. Hunger isnot waiting. The peasants’ Revolution is not waiting. The Admiralswho ran away did not wait.“Blind people are surprised that hungry people, betrayed by admiralsand generals, do not take an interest in voting.“6. If the Kornilovtsi make an attempt, we would show them ourstrength. But why should we risk everything by making an attemptourselves?“Answer: History doesn’t repeat. ‘Perhaps Kornilov will some day makean attempt!’ What a serious base for proletarian action! But supposeKornilov waits for starvation, for the opening of the fronts, whatthen? This attitude means to build the tactics of a revolutionaryparty on one of the bourgeoisie’s former mistakes.“Let us forget everything except that there is no way out but by thedictatorship of the proletariat—either that or the dictatorship ofKornilov.“Let us wait, comrades, for—a miracle!”                                12.                      MILIUKOV’s SPEECH (_Resumé_)“Every one admits, it seems, that the defence of the country is ourprincipal task, and that, to assure it, we must have discipline inthe Army and order in the rear. To achieve this, there must be apower capable of daring, not only by persuasion, but also by force….The germ of all our evils comes from the point of view, original,truly Russian, concerning foreign policy, which passes for theInternationalist point of view.“The noble Lenin only imitates the noble Keroyevsky when he holdsthat from Russia will come the New World which shall resuscitate theaged West, and which will replace the old banner of doctrinarySocialism by the new direct action of starving masses—and that willpush humanity forward and force it to break in the doors of thesocial paradise….”These men sincerely believed that the decomposition of Russia wouldbring about the decomposition of the whole capitalist régime.Starting from that point of view, they were able to commit theunconscious treason, in wartime, of calmly telling the soldiers toabandon the trenches, and instead of fighting the external enemy,creating internal civil war and attacking the proprietors andcapitalists….Here Miliukov was interrupted by furious cries from the Left,demanding what Socialist had ever advised such action….“Martov says that only the revolutionary pressure of the proletariatcan condemn and conquer the evil will of imperialist cliques andbreak down the dictatorship of these cliques…. Not by an accordbetween Governments for a limitation of armaments, but by thedisarming of these Governments and the radical democratisation of themilitary system….”He attacked Martov viciously, and then turned on the Mensheviki andSocialist Revolutionaries, whom he accused of entering the Governmentas Ministers with the avowed purpose of carrying on the classstruggle!“The Socialists of Germany and of the Allied countries contemplatedthese gentlemen with ill-concealed contempt, but they decided that itwas for Russia, and sent us some apostles of the UniversalConflagration….“The formula of our democracy is very simple; no foreign policy, noart of diplomacy, an immediate democratic peace, a declaration to theAllies, ‘We want nothing, we haven’t anything to fight with!’ Andthen our adversaries will make the same declaration, and thebrotherhood of peoples will be accomplished!”Miliukov took a fling at the Zimmerwald Manifesto, and declared thateven Kerensky has not been able to escape the influence of “thatunhappy document which will forever be your indictment.” He thenattacked Skobeliev, whose position in foreign assemblies, where hewould appear as a Russian delegate, yet opposed to the foreign policyof his Government, would be so strange that people would say, “What’sthat gentleman carrying, and what shall we talk to him about?” As forthe _nakaz,_ Miliukov said that he himself was a pacifist; that hebelieved in the creation of an International Arbitration Board, andthe necessity for a limitation of armaments, and parliamentarycontrol over secret diplomacy, which did not mean the abolition ofsecret diplomacy.As for the Socialist ideas in the _nakaz,_ which he called “Stockholmideas”—peace without victory, the right of self-determination ofpeoples, and renunciation of the economic war—“The German successes are directly proportionate to the successes ofthose who call themselves the revolutionary democracy. I do not wishto say, ‘to the successes of the Revolution,’ because I believe thatthe defeats of the revolutionary democracy are victories for theRevolution….“The influence of the Soviet leaders abroad is not unimportant. Onehad only to listen to the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairsto be convinced that, in this hall, the influence of therevolutionary democracy on foreign policy is so strong, that theMinister does not dare to speak face to face with it about the honourand dignity of Russia!“We can see, in the _nakaz_ of the Soviets, that the ideas of theStockholm Manifesto have been elaborated in two direction—that ofUtopianism, and that of German interests….Interrupted by the angry cries of the Left, and rebuked by thePresident, Miliukov insisted that the proposition of peace concludedby popular assemblies, not by diplomats, and the proposal toundertake peace negotiations as soon as the enemy had renouncedannexations, were pro-German. Recently Kuhlman said that a personaldeclaration bound only him who made it…. “Anyway, we will imitate theGermans before we will imitate the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’Deputies….”The sections treating of the independence of Lithuania and Livoniawere symptoms of nationalist agitation in different parts of Russia,supported, said Miliukov, by German money…. Amid bedlam from theLeft, he contrasted the clauses of the _nakaz_ concerningAlsace-Lorraine, Rumania, and Serbia, with those treating of thenationalities in Germany and Austria. The _nakaz_ embraced the Germanand Austrian point of view, said Miliukov.Passing to Terestchenko’s speech, he contemptuously accused him ofbeing afraid to speak the thought in his mind, and even afraid tothink in terms of the greatness of Russia. The Dardanelles mustbelong to Russia….“You are continually saying that the soldier does not know why he isfighting, and that when he does know, he’ll fight…. It is true thatthe soldier doesn’t know why he is fighting, but now you have toldhim that there is no reason for him to fight, that we have nonational interests, and that we are fighting for alien ends….”Paying tribute to the Allies, who, he said, with the assistance ofAmerica, “will yet save the cause of humanity,” he ended:“Long live the light of humanity, the advanced democracies of theWest, who for a long time have been travelling the way we now onlybegin to enter, with ill-assured and hesitating steps! Long live ourbrave Allies!”                                13.                        INTERVIEW WITH KERENSKYThe Associated Press man tried his hand. “Mr. Kerensky,” he began,“in England and France people are disappointed with the Revolution——”“Yes, I know,” interrupted Kerensky, quizzically. “Abroad theRevolution is no longer fashionable!”“What is your explanation of why the Russians have stopped fighting?”“That is a foolish question to ask.” Kerensky was annoyed. “Russiaentered the war first of all the Allies, and for a long time she borethe whole brunt of it. Her losses have been inconceivably greaterthan those of all the other nations put together. Russia has now theright to demand of the Allies that they bring greater force of armsto bear.” He stopped for a moment and stared at his interlocutor.“You are asking why the Russians have stopped fighting, and theRussians are asking where is the British fleet—with Germanbattle-ships in the Gulf of Riga?” Again he ceased suddenly, and assuddenly burst out. “The Russian Revolution hasn’t failed and therevolutionary Army hasn’t failed. It is not the Revolution whichcaused disorganisation in the army—that disorganisation wasaccomplished years ago, by the old regime. Why aren’t the Russiansfighting? I will tell you. Because the masses of the people areeconomically exhausted,—and because they are disillusioned with theAllies!”The interview of which this is an excerpt was cabled to the UnitedStates, and in a few days sent back by the American State Department,with a demand that it be “altered.” This Kerensky refused to do; butit was done by his secretary, Dr. David Soskice—and, thus purged ofall offensive references to the Allies, was given to the press of theworld….                      APPENDIX TO CHAPTER III                                 1.                RESOLUTION OF THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES                        _Workers’ Control_1. (See Ppage 43)2. The organisation of Workers’ Control is a manifestation of thesame healthy activity in the sphere of industrial production, as areparty organisations in the sphere of politics, trade unions inemployment, Cooperatives in the domain of consumption, and literaryclubs in the sphere of culture.3. The working-class has much more interest in the proper anduninterrupted operation of factories… than the capitalist class.Workers’ Control is a better security in this respect for theinterests of modern society, of the whole people, than the arbitrarywill of the owners, who are guided only by their selfish desire formaterial profits or political privileges. Therefore Workers’ Controlis demanded by the proletariat not only in their own interest, but inthe interest of the whole country, and should be supported by therevolutionary peasantry as well as the revolutionary Army.4. Considering the hostile attitude of the majority of the capitalistclass toward the Revolution, experience shows that properdistribution of raw materials and fuel, as well as the most efficientmanagement of factories, is impossible without Workers’ Control.5. Only Workers’ Control over capitalist enterprises, cultivating theworkers’ conscious attitude toward work, and making clear its socialmeaning, can create conditions favourable to the development of afirm self-discipline in labour, and the development of all labour’spossible productivity.6. The impending transformation of industry from a war to a peacebasis, and the redistribution of labour all over the country, as wellas among the different factories, can be accomplished without greatdisturbances only by means of the democratic self-government of theworkers themselves…. Therefore the realisation of Workers’ Control isan indispensable preliminary to the demobilisation of industry.7. In accordance with the slogan proclaimed by the Russian SocialDemocratic Labour Party (Bolsheviki), Workers’ Control on a nationalscale, in order to bring results, must extend to all capitalistconcerns, and not be organised accidentally, without system; it mustbe well-planned, and not separated from the industrial life of thecountry as a whole.8. The economic life of the country—agriculture, industry, commerceand transport—must be subjected to one unified plan, constructed soas to satisfy the individual and social requirements of the widemasses of the people; it must be approved by their electedrepresentatives, and carried out under the direction of theserepresentatives by means of national and local organisations.9. That part of the plan which deals with land-labour must be carriedout under supervision of the peasants’ and land-workers’organisations; that relating to industry, trade and transportoperated by wage-earners, by means of Workers’ Control; the naturalorgans of Workers’ Control inside the industrial plant will be theFactory-Shop and similar Committees; and in the labour market, theTrade Unions.10. The collective wage agreements arranged by the Trade Unions forthe majority of workers in any branch of labour, must be binding onall the owners of plants employing this kind of labour in the givendistrict.11. Employment bureaus must be placed under the control andmanagement of the Trade Unions, as class organisations acting withinthe limits of the whole industrial plan, and in accordance with it.12. Trade Unions must have the right, upon their own initiative, tobegin legal action against all employers who violate labour contractsor labour legislation, and also in behalf of any individual worker inany branch of labour.13. On all questions relating to Workers’ Control over production,distribution and employment, the Trade Unions must confer with theworkers of individual establishments through their Factory-ShopCommittees.14. Matters of employment and discharge, vacations, wage scales,refusal of work, degree of productivity and skill, reasons forabrogating agreements, disputes with the administration, and similarproblems of the internal life of the factory, must be settledexclusively according to the findings of the Factory-Shop Committee,which has the right to exclude from participation in the discussionany members of the factory administration.15. The Factory-Shop Committee forms a commission to control thesupplying of the factory with raw materials, fuel, orders, labourpower and technical staff (including equipment), and all othersupplies and arrangements, and also to assure the factory’s adherenceto the general industrial plan. The factory administration is obligedto surrender to the organs of Workers’ Control, for their aid andinformation, all data concerning the business; to make it possible toverify this data, and to produce the books of the company upon demandof the Factory-Shop Committee.16. Any illegal acts on the part of the administration discovered bythe Factory-Shop Committees, or any suspicion of such illegal acts,which cannot be investigated or remedied by the workers alone, shallbe referred to the district central organisation of Factory-ShopCommittees charged with the particular branch of labour involved,which shall discuss the matter with the institutions charged with theexecution of the general industrial plan, and find means to deal withthe matter, even to the extent of confiscating the factory.17. The union of the Factory-Shop Committees of different concernsmust be accomplished on the basis of the different trades, in orderto facilitate control over the whole branch of industry, so as tocome within the general industrial plan; and so as to create aneffective plan of distribution among the different factories oforders, raw materials, fuel, technical and labour power; and also tofacilitate cooperation with the Trade Unions, which are organised bytrades.18. The central city councils of Trade Unions and Factory-ShopCommittees represent the proletariat in the corresponding provincialand  local institutions formed to elaborate and carry out the generalindustrial plan, and to organise economic relations between the townsand the villages (workers and peasants). They also possess finalauthority for the management of Factory-Shop Committees and TradeUnions, so far as Workers’ Control in their district is concerned,and they shall issue obligatory regulations concerning workers’discipline in the routine of production—which regulations, however,must be approved by vote of the workers themselves.                                 2.                THE BOURGEOIS PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI_Russkaya Volia,_ October 28. “The decisive moment approaches…. It isdecisive for the Bolsheviki. Either they will give us… a secondedition of the events of July 16-18, or they will have to admit thatwith their plans and intentions, with their impertinent policy ofwishing to separate themselves from everything consciously national,they have been definitely defeated….“What are the chances of Bolshevik success?“It is difficult to answer that question, for their principal supportis the… ignorance of the popular masses. They speculate on it, theywork upon it by a demagogy which nothing can stop….“The Government must play its part in this affair. Supporting itselfmorally by the Council of the Republic, the Government must take aclearly-defined attitude toward the Bolsheviki….“And if the Bolsheviki provoke an insurrection against the legalpower, and thus facilitate the German invasion, they must be treatedas mutineers and traitors….”_Birzhevya Viedomosti,_ October 28. “Now that the Bolsheviki haveseparated themselves from the rest of the democracy, the struggleagainst them is very much simpler—and it is not reasonable, in orderto fight against Bolshevism, to wait until they make a manifestation.The Government should not even allow the manifestation….“The appeals of the Bolsheviki to insurrection and anarchy are actspunishable by the criminal courts, and in the freest countries, theirauthors would receive severe sentences. For what the Bolsheviki arecarrying on is not a political struggle against the Government, oreven for the power; it is propaganda for anarchy, massacres, andcivil war. This propaganda must be extirpated at its roots; it wouldbe strange to wait, in order to begin action against an agitation for_pogroms,_ until the _pogroms_ actually occurred….”_Novoye Vremya,_ November 1. “hellip; Why is the Government excitedonly about November 2d (date of calling of the Congress of Soviets),and not about September 12th, or October 3d?“This is not the first time that Russia burns and falls in ruins, andthat the smoke of the terrible conflagration makes the eyes of ourAllies smart….“Since it came to power, has there been a single order issued by theGovernment for the purpose of halting anarchy, or has any oneattempted to put out the Russian conflagration?“There were other things to do….“The Government turned its attention to a more immediate problem. Itcrushed an insurrection (the Kornilov attempt) concerning which everyone is now asking, ‘Did it ever exist?”                                 3.                MODERATE SOCIALIST PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI_Dielo Naroda,_ October 28 (Socialist Revolutionary). “The mostfrightful crime of the Bolsheviki against the Revolution is that theyimpute  exclusively to the bad intentions of the revolutionaryGovernment all the calamities which the masses are so cruellysuffering; when as a matter of fact these calamities spring fromobjective causes.“They make golden promises to the masses, knowing in advance thatthey can fulfil none of them; they lead the masses on a false trail,deceiving them as to the source of all their troubles….“The Bolsheviki are the most dangerous enemies of the Revolution….”_Dien,_ October 30 (Menshevik). “Is this really ‘the freedom of thepress’? Every day _Novaya Rus_ and _Rabotchi Put_ openly incite toinsurrection. Every day these two papers commit in their columnsactual crimes. Every day they urge _pogroms_…. Is that ‘the freedomof the press’?…“The Government ought to defend itself and defend us. We have theright to insist that the Government machinery does not remain passivewhile the threat of bloody riots endangers the lives of itscitizens….”                                 4.                            “YEDINSTVO”Plekhanov’s paper, _Yedinstvo,_ suspended publication a few weeksafter the Bolsheviki seized the power. Contrary to popular report,_Yedinstvo_ was not suppressed by the Soviet Government; anannouncement in the last number admitted that it was unable tocontinue _because there were too few subscribers_….                                 5.                WERE THE BOLSHEVIKI CONSPIRATORS?The French newspaper _Entente_ of Petrograd, on November 15th,published an article of which the following is a part:“The Government of Kerensky discusses and hesitates. The Governmentof Lenin and Trotzky attacks and acts.“This last is called a Government of Conspirators, but that is wrong.Government of usurpers, yes, like all revolutionary Governments whichtriumph over their adversaries. Conspirators—no!“No! They did not conspire. On the contrary, openly, audaciously,without mincing words, without dissimulating their intentions, theymultiplied their agitation, intensified their propaganda in thefactories, the barracks, at the Front, in the country, everywhere,even fixing in advance the date of their taking up arms, the date oftheir seizure of the power….“_They_—conspirators? Never….”                                 6.                    APPEAL AGAINST INSURRECTION                _From the Central Army Committee_“… Above everything we insist upon the inflexible execution of theorganised will of the majority of the people, expressed by theProvisional Government in accord with the Council of the Republic andthe _Tsay-ee-kah,_ as organ of the popular power….“Any demonstration to depose this power by violence, at a moment whena Government crisis will infallibly create disorganisation, the ruinof the country, and civil war, will be considered by the Army as acounter-revolutionary act, and repressed by force of arms….“The interests of private groups and classes should be submitted to asingle interest—that of augmenting industrial production, anddistributing the necessities of life with fairness….“All who are capable of sabotage, disorganisation, or disorder, alldeserters, all slackers, all looters, should be forced to doauxiliary service in the rear of the Army….“We invite the Provisional Government to form, out of these violatorsof the people’s will, these enemies of the Revolution, labourdetachments to work in the rear, on the Front, in the trenches underenemy fire….”                                 7.                EVENTS OF THE NIGHT, NOVEMBER 6THToward evening bands of Red Guards began to occupy the printing shopsof the bourgeois press, where they printed _Rabotchi Put, Soldat,_and various proclamations by the hundred thousand. The City Militiawas ordered to clear these places, but found the offices barricaded,and armed men defending them. Soldiers who were ordered to attack theprint-shops refused.About midnight a Colonel with a company of _yunkers_ arrived at theclub “Free Mind,” with a warrant to arrest the editor of _RabotchiPut._ Immediately an enormous mob gathered in the street outside andthreatened to lynch the _yunkers._ The Colonel thereupon begged thathe and the _yunkers_ be arrested and taken to Peter-Paul prison forsafety. This request was granted.At 1 A. M. a detachment of soldiers and sailors from Smolny occupiedthe Telegraph Agency. At 1.35 the Post Office was occupied. Towardmorning the Military Hotel was taken, and at 5 o’clock the TelephoneExchange. At dawn the State Bank was surrounded. And at 10 A. M. acordon of troops was drawn about the Winter Palace.                       APPENDIX TO CHAPTER IV                                 1.                        EVENTS OF NOVEMBER 7THFrom 4 A. M. until dawn Kerensky remained at the Petrograd StaffHeadquarters, sending orders to the Cossacks and to the _yunkers_ inthe Officers’ Schools in and around Petrograd—all of whom answeredthat they were unable to move.Colonel Polkovnikov, Commandant of the City, hurried between theStaff and the Winter Palace, evidently without any plan. Kerenskygave an order to open the bridges; three hours passed without anyaction, and then an officer and five men went out on their owninitiative, and putting to flight a picket of Red Guards, opened theNicolai Bridge. Immediately after they left, however, some sailorsclosed it again.Kerensky ordered the print-shop of _Rabotchi Put_ to be occupied. Theofficer detailed to the work was promised a squad of soldiers; twohours later he was promised some _yunkers;_ then the order wasforgotten.An attempt was made to recapture the Post Office and the TelegraphAgency; a few shots were fired, and the Government troops announcedthat they would no longer oppose the Soviets.To a delegation of _yunkers_ Kerensky said, “As chief of theProvisional Government and as Supreme Commander I know nothing, Icannot advise you; but as a veteran revolutionist, I appeal to you,young revolutionists, to remain at your posts and defend theconquests of the Revolution.”Orders of Kishkin, November 7th:“By decree of the Provisional Government…. I am invested withextraordinary powers for the reestablishment of order in Petrograd,in complete command of all civil and military authorities….”“In accordance with the powers conferred upon me by the ProvisionalGovernment, I herewith relieve from his functions as Commandant ofthe Petrograd Military District Colonel George Polkovnikov….”                        *     *     *     *     *_Appeal to the Population_ signed by Vice-Premier Konovalov, November7th:“Citizens!

A telegram has been sent to the_Stavka;_ and an answer received says that a strong detachment oftroops is being sent….“Let the Army and the People reject the irresponsible attempts of theBolsheviki to create a revolt in the rear….”About 9 A. M. Kerensky left for the Front….Toward evening two soldiers on bicycles presented themselves at theStaff Headquarters, as delegates of the garrison of Peter-PaulFortress. Entering the meeting-room of the Staff, where Kishkin,Rutenburg, Paltchinski, General Bagratouni, Colonel Paradielov andCount Tolstoy were gathered, they demanded the immediate surrender ofthe Staff; threatening, in case of refusal, to bombard headquarters….After two panicky conferences the Staff retreated to the WinterPalace, and the headquarters were occupied by Red Guards….Late in the afternoon several Bolshevik armoured cars cruised aroundthe Palace Square, and Soviet soldiers tried unsuccessfully to parleywith the _yunkers_….Firing on the Palace began about 7 o’clock in the evening….At 10 P. M. began an artillery bombardment from three sides, in whichmost of the shells were blanks, only three small shrapnels strikingthe facade of the Palace….                                 2.                        KERENSKY IN FLIG{HT  -ed.}Leaving Petrograd in the morning of November 7th, Kerensky arrived byautomobile at Gatchina, where he demanded a special train. Towardevening he was in Ostrov, Province of Pskov. The next morning,extraordinary  session of the local Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’Depulies, with participation of Cossack delegates—there being 6,000Cossacks at Ostrov.Kerensky spoke to the assembly, appealing for aid against theBolsheviki, and addressed himself almost exclusively to the Cossacks.The soldier delegates protested.“Why did you come here?” shouted voices. Kerensky answered, “To askthe Cossacks’ assistance in crushing the Bolshevik insurrection!” Atthis there were violent protestations, which increased when hecontinued, “I broke the Kornilov attempt, and I will break theBolsheviki!” The noise became so great that he had to leave theplatform….The soldier deputies and the Ussuri Cossacks decided to arrestKerensky, but the Don Cossacks prevented them, and got him away bytrain…. A Military Revolutionary Committee, set up during the day,tried to inform the garrison of Pskov; but the telephone andtelegraph lines were cut….Kerensky did not arrive at Pskov. Revolutionary soldiers had cut therailway line, to prevent troops being sent against the capital. Onthe night of November 8th he arrived by automobile at Luga, where hewas well received by the Death Battalions stationed there.Next day he took train for the South-West Front, and visited the ArmyCommittee at headquarters. The Fifth Army, however, was wild withenthusiasm over the news of the Bolshevik success, and the ArmyCommittee was unable to promise Kerensky any support.From there he went to the _Stavka,_ at Moghilev, where he ordered tenregiments from different parts of the Front to move againstPetrograd. The soldiers almost unanimously refused; and thoseregiments which did start halted on the way. About five thousandCossacks finally followed him….                                 3.                    LOOTING OF THE WINTER PALACEI do not mean to maintain that there was no looting, in the WinterPalace. Both after and _before_ the Winter Palace fell, there wasconsiderable pilfering. The statement of the Socialist Revolutionarypaper _Narod,_ and of members of the City Duma, to the effect thatprecious objects to the value of 500,000,000 rubles had been stolen,was, however, a gross exaggeration.The most important art treasures of the Palace—paintings, statues,tapestries, rare porcelains and armorie,—had been transferred toMoscow during the month of September; and they were still in goodorder in the basement of the Imperial Palace there ten days after thecapture of the Kremlin by Bolshevik troops. I can personally testifyto this….Individuals, however, especially the general public, which wasallowed to circulate freely through the Winter Palace for severaldays after its capture, made away with table silver, clocks, bedding,mirrors and some odd vases of valuable porcelain and semi-preciousstone, to the value of about $50,000.The Soviet Government immediately created a special commission,composed of artists and archæologists, to recover the stolen objects.On November 1st two proclamations were issued:                        “CITIZENS OF PETROGRAD!“We urgently ask all citizens to exert every effort to find whateverpossible of the objects stolen from the Winter Palace in the night ofNovember 7-8, and to forward them to the Commandant of the WinterPalace.“Receivers of stolen goods, antiquarians, and all who are proved tobe hiding such objects will be held legally responsible and punishedwith all severity.“_Commissars for the Protection of Museums and Artistic Collections,_                                “G.

MANDELBAUM.”About half the loot was recovered, some of it in the baggage offoreigners leaving Russia.A conference of artists and archæologists, held at the suggestion ofSmolny, appointed a commission of make an inventory of the WinterPalace treasures, which was given complete charge of the Palace andof all artistic collections and State museums in Petrograd. OnNovember 16th the Winter Palace was closed to the public while theinventory was being made….During the last week in November a decree was issued by the Councilof People’s Commissars, changing the name of the Winter Palace to“People’s Museum,” entrusting it to the complete charge of theartistic-archæological commission, and declaring that henceforth allGovernmental activities within its wall were prohibited….                                 4.                    RAPE OF THE WOMEN’S BATTALIONImmediately following the taking of the Winter Palace all sorts ofsensational stories were published in the anti-Bolshevik press, andtold in the City Duma, about the fate of the Women’s Battaliondefending the Palace. It was said that some of the girl-soldiers hadbeen thrown from the windows into the street, most of the rest hadbeen violated, and many had committed suicide as a result of thehorrors they had gone through.The City Duma appointed a commission to investigate the matter. OnNovember 16th the commission returned from Levashovo, headquarters ofthe Women’s Battalion. Madame Tyrkova reported that the girls hadbeen at first taken to the barracks of the Pavlovsky Regiment, andthat there some of them had been badly treated; but that at presentmost of them were at Levashovo, and the rest scattered about the cityin private houses. Dr. Mandelbaum, another of the commission,testified drily that _none_ of the women had been thrown out of thewindows of the Winter Palace, that _none_ were wounded, that threehad been violated, and that one had committed suicide, leaving a notewhich said that she had been “disappointed in her ideals.”On November 21st the Military Revolutionary Committee officiallydissolved the Women’s Battalion, at the request of the girlsthemselves, who returned to civilian clothes.In Louise Bryant’s book, “Six Red Months in Russia,” there is aninteresting description of the girl-soldiers during this time.                        APPENDIX TO CHAPTER V                                 1.                        APPEALS AND PROCLAMATIONS_From the Military Revolutionary Committee,_ November 8:“To All Army Committees and All Soviets of Soldiers’ Deputies.“The Petrograd garrison has overturned the Government of Kerensky,which had risen against the Revolution and the People…. In sendingthis news to the Front and the country, the Military RevolutionaryCommittee requests all soldiers to keep vigilant watch on the conductof officers. Officers who do not frankly and openly declare for theRevolution should be immediately arrested as enemies.“The Petrograd Soviet interprets the programme of the new Governmentas: immediate proposals of a general democratic peace, the immediatetransfer of great landed estates to the peasants, and the honestconvocation of the Constituent Assembly. The people’s revolutionaryArmy must not permit troops of doubtful morale to be sent toPetrograd. Act by means of arguments, by means of moral suasion—butif that fails, halt the movement of troops by implacable force.“The present order must be immediately read to all military units ofevery branch of the service. Whoever keeps the knowledge of thisorder from the soldier-masses…. commits a serious crime against theRevolution, and will be punished with all the rigour of revolutionarylaw.“Soldiers!

The presidents of the variouslocal Soviets are invited to enter into direct relations with therevolutionary Government.”                                _Military Revolutionary Committee._                                 2.                PROTEST OF THE MUNICIPAL DUMA“The Central City Duma, elected on the most democratic principles,has undertaken the burden of managing Municipal affairs and foodsupplies at the time of the greatest disorganisation. At the presentmoment the Bolshevik party, three weeks before the elections to theConstituent Assembly, and in spite of the menace of the externalenemy, having removed by armed force the only legal revolutionaryauthority, is making an attempt against the rights and independenceof the Municipal Self-Government, demanding submission to itsCommissars and its illegal authority.“In this terrible and tragic moment the Petrograd City Duma, in theface of its constituents, and of all Russia, declares loudly that itwill not submit to any encroachments on its rights and itsindependence, and will remain at the post of responsibility to whichit has been called by the will of the population of the capital.“The Central City Duma of Petrograd appeals to all Dumas and Zemstvosof the Russian Republic to rally to the defence of one of thegreatest conquests of the Russian Revolution—the independence andinviolability of popular self-government.”                                 3.                LAND DECREE—PEASANTS’ “NAKAZ”The Land question can only be permanently settled by the generalConstituent Assembly.The most equitable solution of the Land question should be as follows:1. The right of private ownership of land is abolished forever; landcannot be sold, nor leased, nor mortgaged, nor alienated in any way.All dominical lands, lands attached to titles, lands belonging to theEmperor’s cabinet, to monasteries, churches, possession lands,entailed lands, private estates, communal lands, peasant free-holds,and others, are confiscated without compensation, and become nationalproperty, and are placed at the disposition of the workers whocultivate them.Those who are damaged because of this social transformation of therights of property are entitled to public aid during the timenecessary for them to adapt themselves to the new conditions ofexistence.2. All the riches beneath the earth—ores, oil, coal, salt, etc.—aswell as forests and waters having a national importance, become theexclusive property of the State. All minor streams, lakes and forestsare placed in the hands of the communities, on condition of beingmanaged by the local organs of government.3. All plots of land scientifically cultivated—gardens, plantations,nurseries, seed-plots, green-houses, and others—shall not be divided,but transformed into model farms, and pass into the hands of theState or of the community, according to their size and importance.Buildings, communal lands and villages with their private gardens andtheir orchards remain in the hands of their present owners; thedimensions of these plots and the rate of taxes for their use shallbe fixed by law.4. All studs, governmental and private cattle-breeding andbird-breeding establishments, and others, are confiscated and becomenational property, and are transferred either to the State or to thecommunity, according to their size and importance.All questions of compensation for the above are within the competenceof the Constituent Assembly.5. All inventoried agricultural property of the confiscated lands,machinery  and live-stock, are transferred without compensation tothe State or the community, according to their quantity andimportance.The confiscation of such machinery or live-stock shall not apply tothe small properties of peasants.6. The right to use the land is granted to all citizens, withoutdistinction of sex, who wish to work the land themselves, with thehelp of their families, or in partnership, and only so long as theyare able to work. No hired labour is permitted.In the event of the incapacity for work of a member of the communefor a period of two years, the commune shall be bound to render himassistance during this time by working his land in common.Farmers who through old age or sickness have permanently lost thecapacity to work the land themselves, shall surrender their land andreceive instead a Government pension.7. The use of the land should be equalised—that is to say, the landshall be divided among the workers according to local conditions, theunit of labour and the needs of the individual.The way in which land is to be used may be individually determinedupon: as homesteads, as farms, by communes, by partnerships, as willbe decided by the villages and settlements.8. All land upon its confiscation is pooled in the general People’sLand Fund. Its distribution among the workers is carried out by thelocal and central organs of administration, beginning with thevillage democratic organisations and ending with the centralprovincial institutions—with the exception of urban and ruralcooperative societies.The Land Fund is subject to periodical redistribution according tothe increase of population and the development of productivity andrural economy.In case of modification of the boundaries of allotments, the originalcentre of the allotment remains intact.The lands of persons retiring from the community return to the LandFund; providing that near relatives of the persons retiring, orfriends designated by them, shall have preference in theredistribution of these lands.When lands are returned to the Land Fund, the money expended formanuring or improving the land, which has not been exhausted, shallbe reimbursed.If in some localities the Land Fund is insufficient to satisfy thelocal population, the surplus population should emigrate.The organisation of the emigration, also the costs thereof, and theproviding of emigrants with the necessary machinery and live-stock,shall be the business of the State.The emigration shall be carried out in the following order: first,the peasants without land who express their wish to emigrate; thenthe undesirable members of the community, deserters, etc., andfinally, by drawing lots on agreement.All which is contained in this _nakaz,_ being the expression of theindisputable will of the great majority of conscious peasants ofRussia, is declared to be a temporary law, and until the convocationof the Constituent Assembly, becomes effective immediately so far asis possible, and in some parts of it gradually, as will be determinedby the District Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies.                                 4.                        THE LAND AND DESERTERSThe Government was not forced to make any decision concerning therights of deserters to the land. The end of the war and thedemobilisation of the army automatically removed the deserterproblem….                                 5.                THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARSThe Council of People’s Commissars was at first composed entirely ofBolsheviki. This was not entirely the fault of the Bolsheviki,however. On November 8th they offered portfolios to members of theLeft Socialist Revolutionaries, who declined. See page 273. {of originalvolume}                       APPENDIX  TO CHAPTER VI                                 1.                        APPEALS AND DENUNCIATIONSAppeal to all Citizens and to the Military Organisations of theSocialist Revolutionary Party.“The senseless attempt of the Bolsheviki is on the eve of completefailure. The garrison is disaffected…. The Ministries are idle, breadis lacking. All factions except a handful of Bolsheviki have left theCongress of Soviets. The Bolsheviki are alone! Abuses of all sorts,acts of vandalism and pillage, the bombardment of the Winter Palace,arbitrary arrests—all these crimes committed by the Bolsheviki havearoused against them the resentment of the majority of the sailorsand soldiers. The _Tsentroflot_ refuses to submit to the orders ofthe Bolsheviki….“We call upon all sane elements to gather around the Committee forSalvation of Country and Revolution; to take serious measures to beready, at the first call of the Central Committee of the Party, toact against the counter-revolutionists, who will doubtless attempt toprofit by these troubles provoked by the Bolshevik adventure, and towatch closely the external enemy, who also would like to takeadvantage of this opportune moment when the Front is weakened….”                _The Military Section of the Central Committee of                        the Socialist Revolutionary Party._                        *     *     *     *     *From _Pravda:_“What is Kerensky?“A usurper, whose place is in Peter-Paul prison, with Kornilov andKishkin.“A criminal and a traitor to the workers, soldiers and peasants, whobelieved in him.“Kerensky? A murderer of soldiers!“Kerensky? A public executioner of peasants!“Kerensky? A strangler of workers!“Such is the second Kornilov who now wants to butcher Liberty!”                      APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VII                                 1.                            TWO DECREES                            _On the Press_In the serious decisive hour of the Revolution and the daysimmediately following it, the Provisional Revolutionary Committee iscompelled to adopt a series of measures against thecounter-revolutionary press of all shades.Immediately on all sides there are cries that the new Socialistauthority is in this violating the essential principles of its ownprogramme by an attempt against the freedom of the press.The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government calls the attention of thepopulation to the fact that in our country, behind this liberalshield, is hidden the opportunity for the wealthier classes to seizethe lion’s share of the whole press, and by this means to poison thepopular mind and bring confusion into the consciousness of the masses.Every one knows that the bourgeois press is one of the most powerfulweapons of the bourgeoisie. Especially in this critical moment, whenthe new authority of the workers and peasants is in process ofconsolidation, it is impossible to leave it in the hands of theenemy, at a time when it is not less dangerous than bombs andmachine-guns. This is why temporary and extraordinary measures havebeen adopted for the purpose of stopping the flow of filth andcalumny in which the yellow and green press would be glad to drownthe young victory of the people.As soon as the new order is consolidated, all administrative measuresagainst the press will be suspended; full liberty will be given itwithin the limits of responsibility before the law, in accordancewith the broadest and most progressive regulations….Bearing in mind, however, the fact that any restrictions of thefreedom of the press, even in critical moments, are admissible onlywithin the bounds of necessity, the Council of People’s Commissarsdecrees as follows:1. The following classes of newspapers shall be subject to closure:(a) Those inciting to open resistance or disobedience to the Workers’and Peasants’ Government; (b) Those creating confusion by obviouslyand deliberately perverting the news; (c) Those inciting to acts of acriminal character punishable by the laws.2. The temporary or permanent closing of any organ of the press shallbe carried out only by virtue of a resolution of the Council ofPeople’s Commissars.3. The present decree is of a temporary nature, and will be revokedby a special _ukaz_ when normal conditions of public life arere-established.                       _President of the Council of People’s Commissars,_                                                VLADIMIR ULIANOV (LENIN).                        *     *     *     *     *                        _On Workers’ Militia_1. All Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies shall form aWorkers’ Militia.2. This Workers’ Militia shall be entirely at the orders of theSoviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.3. Military and civil authorities must render every assistance inarming the workers and in supplying them with technical equipment,even to the extent of requisitioning arms belonging to the WarDepartment of the Government.4. This decree shall be promulgated by telegraph. Petrograd, November10, 1917.                                _People’s Commissar of the Interior_                                                A. I.

THE STRIKE FUNDThe fund for the striking Government employees and bank clerks wassubscribed by banks and business houses of Petrograd and othercities, and also by foreign corporations doing business in Russia.All who consented to strike against the Bolsheviki were paid fullwages, and in some cases their pay was increased. It was therealisation of the strike fund contributors that the Bolsheviki werefirmly in power, followed by their refusal to pay strike benefits,which finally broke the strike.                      APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VIII                                 1.                        KERENSKY’S ADVANCEOn November 9th Kerensky and his Cossacks arrived at Gatchina, wherethe garrison, hopelessly split into two factions, immediatelysurrendered. The members of the Gatchina Soviet were arrested, and atfirst threatened with death; later they were released on goodbehaviour.The Cossack advance-guards, practically unopposed, occupied Pavlovsk,Alexandrovsk and other stations, and reached the outskirts ofTsarskoye Selo next morning—November 10th. At once the garrisondivided into three groups—the officers, loyal to Kerenskly; part ofthe soldiers and non-commissioned officers, who declared themselves“neutral”; and most of the rank and file, who were for theBolsheviki. The Bolshevik soldiers, who were without leaders ororganisation, fell back toward the capital. The local Soviet alsowithdrew to the village of Pulkovo.From Pulkovo six members of the Tsarskoye Selo Soviet went with anautomobile-load of proclamations to Gatchina, to propagandise theCossacks. They spent most of the day going around Gatchina from oneCossack barracks to another, pleading, arguing and explaining. Towardevening some officers discovered their presence and they werearrested and brought before General Krasnov, who said, “You foughtagainst Kornilov; now you are opposing Kerensky. I’ll have you allshot!”After reading aloud to them the order appointing himcommander-in-chief of the Petrograd District, Krasnov asked if theywere Bolsheviki. They replied in the affirmative—upon which Krasnovwent away; a short time later an officer came and set them free,saying that it was by order of General Krasnov….In the meanwhile delegations continued to arrive from Petrograd; fromthe Duma, the Committee for Salvation, and, last of all, from the_Vikzhel._ The Union of Railway Workers insisted that some agreementbe reached to halt the civil war, and demanded that Kerensky treatwith the Bolsheviki, and that he stop the advance on Petrograd. Incase of refusal, the _Vikzhel_ threatened a general strike atmidnight of November 11th.Kerensky asked to be allowed to discuss the matter with the SocialistMinisters and with the Committee for Salvation. He was plainlyundecided.On the 11th Cossack outposts reached Krasnoye Selo, from which thelocal Soviet and the heterogeneous forces of the MilitaryRevolutionary Committee precipitately retired, some of themsurrendering…. That night they also touched Pulkovo, where the firstreal resistance was encountered….Cossacks deserters began to dribble into Petrograd, declaring thatKerensky had lied to them, that he had spread broadcast over thefront proclamations which said that Petrograd was burning, that theBolsheviki  had invited the Germans to come in, and that they weremurdering women and children and looting indiscriminately….The Military Revolutionary Committee immediately sent out some dozensof “agitators,” with thousands of printed appeals, to inform theCossacks of the real situation….                                 2.        PROCLAMATIONS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE“To All Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies.“The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ andPeasants’ Deputies charges the local Soviets immediately to take themost energetic measures to oppose all counter-revolutionaryanti-Semitic disturbances, and all _pogroms_ of whatever nature. Thehonour of the workers’, peasants’ and soldiers’ Revolution cannottolerate any disorders….“The Red Guard of Petrograd, the revolutionary garrison and thesailors have maintained complete order in the capital.“Workers, soldiers, and peasants, everywhere you should follow theexample of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd.“Comrades soldiers and Cossacks, on us falls the duty of keeping realrevolutionary order.“All revolutionary Russia and the whole world have their eyes onyou….”“The All-Russian Congress of Soviets decrees:“To abolish capital punishment at the Front, which was reintroducedby Kerensky.“Complete freedom of propaganda is to be re-established in thecountry. All soldiers and revolutionary officers now under arrest forso-called political ‘crimes’ are at once to be set free.”“The ex-Premier Kerensky, overthrown by the people, refuses to submitto the Congress of Soviets and attempts to struggle against the legalGovernment elected by the All-Russian Congress—the Council ofPeople’s Commissars. The Front has refused to aid Kerensky. Moscowhas rallied to the new Government. In many cities (Minsk, Moghilev,Kharkov) the power is in the hands of the Soviets. No infantrydetachment consents to march against the Workers’ and Peasants’Government, which, in accord with the firm will of the Army and thepeople, has begun peace negotiations and has given the land to thepeasants….“We give public warning that if the Cossacks do not halt Kerensky,who has deceived them and is leading them against Petrograd, therevolutionary forces will rise with all their might for the defenceof the precious conquests of the Revolution—Peace and Land.“Citizens of Petrograd! Kerensky fled from the city, abandoning theauthority to Kishkin, who wanted to surrender the capital to theGermans; Rutenburg, of the Black Band, who sabotaged the MunicipalFood Supply; and Paltchinsky, hated by the whole democracy. Kerenskyhas fled, abandoning you to the Germans, to famine, to bloodymassacres. The revolting people have arrested Kerensky’s Ministers,and you have seen how the order and supplying of Petrograd at onceimproved. Kerensky, at the demand of the aristocrat proprietors, thecapitalists, speculators, marches against you for the purpose ofgiving back the land to the land-owners, and continuing the hated andruinous war.“Citizens of Petrograd! We know that the great majority of you are infavour of the people’s revolutionary authority, against theKornilovtsi led by Kerensky. Do not be deceived by the lyingdeclarations of the impotent bourgeois conspirators, who will bepitilessly crushed.“Workers, soldiers, peasants! We call upon you for revolutionarydevotion and discipline.“Millions of peasants and soldiers are with us.“The victory of the people’s Revolution is assured!”                                 3.                ACTS OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARSIn this book I am giving only such decrees as are in my opinionpertinent to the Bolshevik conquest of power. The rest belong to adetailed account of the Structure of the Soviet State, for which Ihave no place in this work. This will be dealt with very fully in thesecond volume, now in preparation, “Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk.”                _Concerning Dwelling-Places_1. The independent Municipal Self-Governments have the right tosequestrate all unoccupied or uninhabited dwelling-places.2. The Municipalities may, according to laws and arrangementsestablished by them, install in all available lodgings citizens whohave no place to live, or who live in congested or unhealthy lodgings.3. The Municipalities may establish a service of inspection ofdwelling-places, organise it and define its powers.4. The Municipalities may issue orders on the institution of HouseCommittees, define their organisation, their powers and give themjuridical authority.5. The Municipalities may create Housing Tribunals, define theirpowers and their authority.6. This decree is promulgated by telegraph.                                _People’s Commissar of the Interior,_                                                A. I.

The Government of the Tsar, the proprietors and thecapitalists, as well as the Government of coalition and conciliation,failed to realise the desires of the workers with regard to SocialInsurance.The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government, relying upon the support ofthe Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, announcesto the working-class of Russia and to the town and village poor, thatit will immediately prepare laws on Social Insurance based on theformulas proposed by the Labour organisations:1. Insurance for all wage-workers without exception, as well as forall urban and rural poor.2. Insurance to cover all categories of loss of working capacity,such as illness, infirmities, old age, childbirth, widowhood,orphanage, and unemployment.3. All the costs of insurance to be charged to employers.4. Compensation of at least full wages in all loss of workingcapacity and unemployment.5. Complete workers’ self-government of all Insurance institutions.In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic,                                _The People’s Commissar of Labour,_                                                ALEXANDER SHLIAPNIKOV.                        *     *     *     *     *                        _On Popular Education_Citizens of Russia!With the insurrection of November 7th the working masses have won forthe first time the real power.The All-Russian Congress of Soviets has temporarily transferred thispower both to its Executive Committee and to the Council of People’sCommissars.By the will of the revolutionary people, I have been appointedPeople’s Commissar of Education.The work of guiding in general the people’s education, inasmuch as itremains with the central government, is, until the ConstituentAssembly meets, entrusted to a Commission on the People’s Education,whose chairman and executive is the People’s Commissar.Upon what fundamental propositions will rest this State Commission?How is its sphere of competence determined?_The General Line of Educational Activity:_ Every genuinelydemocratic power must, in the domain of education, in a country whereilliteracy and ignorance reign supreme, make its first aim thestruggle against this darkness. It must acquire in the shortest time_universal literacy,_ by organising a network of schools answering tothe demands of modern pedagogics; it must introduce universal,obligatory and free tuition for all, and establish at the same time aseries of such teachers’ institutes and seminaries as will in theshortest time furnish a powerful army of people’s teachers sonecessary for the universal instruction of the population of ourboundless Russia._Decentralisation:_ The State Commission on People’s Education is byno means a central power governing the institutions of instructionand education. On the contrary, the entire school work ought to betransferred to the organs of local self-government. The independentwork of the workers, soldiers and peasants, establishing on their owninitiative cultural educational organisations, must be given fullautonomy, both by the State centre and the Municipal centres.The work of the State Commission serves as a link and helpmate toorganise resources of material and moral support to the Municipal andprivate institutions, particularly to those with a class-characterestablished by the workers._The State Committee on People’s Education:_ A whole series ofinvaluable law projects was elaborated from the beginning of theRevolution by the State Committee for People’s Education, a tolerablydemocratic body as to its composition, and rich in experts. The StateCommission sincerely desires the collaboration of this Committee.It has addressed itself to the bureau of the Committee, with therequest at once to convoke an extraordinary session of the Committeefor the fulfilment of the following programme:1. The revision of rules of representation in the Committee, in thesense of greater democratisation.2. The revision of the Committee’s rights in the sense of wideningthem, and of converting the Committee into a fundamental Stateinstitute for the elaboration of law projects calculated toreorganise public instruction and education in Russia upon democraticprinciples.3. The revision, jointly with the new State Commission, of the lawsalready created by the Committee, a revision required by the factthat in editing them the Committee had to take into account thebourgeois spirit of previous Ministries, which obstructed it even inthis its narrowed form.After this revision these laws will be put into effect without anybureau-cratic red tape, in the revolutionary order._The Pedagogues and the Societists:_ The State Commission welcomesthe pedagogues to the bright and honourable work of educating thepeople—the masters of the country.No one measure in the domain of the people’s education ought to beadopted by any power without the attentive deliberation of those whorepresent the pedagogues.On the other hand, a decision cannot by any means be reachedexclusively through the cooperation of specialists. This refers aswell to reforms of the institutes of general education.The cooperation of the pedagogues with the social forces—this is howthe Commission will work both in its own constitution, in the StateCommittee, and in all its activities.As its first task the Commission considers the improvement of theteachers’ status, and first of all of those very poor though almostmost important contributors to the work of culture—the elementaryschool teachers. Their just demands ought to be satisfied at once andat any cost. The proletariat of the schools has in vain demanded anincrease of salary to one hundred rubles per month. It would be adisgrace any longer to keep in poverty the teachers of theoverwhelming majority of the Russian people.But a real democracy cannot stop at mere literacy, at universalelementary instruction. It must endeavour to organise a uniformsecular school of several grades. The ideal is, equal and if possiblehigher education for all the citizens. So long as this idea has notbeen realised for all, the natural transition through all theschooling grades up to the university—a transition to a higherstage—must depend entirely upon the pupil’s aptitude, and not uponthe resources of his family.The problem of a genuinely democratic organisation of instruction isparticularly difficult in a country impoverished by a long, criminal,imperialistic war; but the workers who have taken the power mustremember that education will serve them as the greatest instrument intheir struggle for a better lot and for a spiritual growth. Howeverneedful it may be to curtail other articles of the people’s budget,the expenses on education must stand high. A large educational budgetis the pride and glory of a nation. The free and enfranchised peoplesof Russia will not forget this.The fight against illiteracy and ignorance cannot be confined to athorough establishment of school education for children and youths.Adults, too, will be anxious to save themselves from the debasingposition of a man who cannot read and write. The school for adultsmust occupy a conspicuous place in the general plan of popularinstruction._Instruction and Education:_ One must emphasise the differencebetween instruction and education.Instruction is the transmission of ready knowledge by the teacher tohis pupil. Education is a creative process. The personality of theindividual is being “educated” throughout life, is being formed,grows richer in content, stronger and more perfect.The toiling masses of the people—the workmen, the peasants, thesoldiers—are thirsting for elementary and advanced instruction. Butthey are also thirsting for education. Neither the government nor theintellectuals nor any other power outside of themselves can give itto them. The school, the book, the theatre, the museum, etc., mayhere by only aids. They have their own ideas, formed by their socialposition, so different from the position of those ruling classes andintellectuals who have hitherto created culture. They have their ownideas, their own emotions, their own ways of approaching the problemsof personality and society. The city labourer, according to his ownfashion, the rural toiler according to his, will each build his clearworld-conception permeated with the class-idea  of the workers. Thereis no more superb or beautiful phenomenon than the one of which ournearest descendants will be both witnesses and participants: Thebuilding by collective Labour of its own general, rich and free soul.Instruction will surely be an important but not a decisive element.What is more important here is the criticism, the creativeness of themasses themselves; for science and art have only in some of theirparts a general human importance. They suffer radical changes withevery far-reaching class upheaval.Throughout Russia, particularly among the city labourers, but alsoamong the peasants, a powerful wave of cultural educational movementhas arisen; workers’ and soldiers’ organisations of this kind aremultiplying rapidly. To meet them, to lend them support, to clear theroad before them is the first task of a revolutionary and populargovernment in the domain of democratic education._The Constituent Assembly_ will doubtless soon begin its work. Italone can permanently establish the order of national and social lifein our country, and at the same time the general character of theorganisation of popular education.Now, however, with the passage of power to the Soviets, the reallydemocratic character of the Constituent Assembly is assured. The linewhich the State Commission, relying upon the State Committee, willfollow, will hardly suffer any modification under the influence ofthe Constituent Assembly. Without pre-determining it, the newPeople’s Government considers itself within its rights in enacting inthis domain a series of measures which aim at enriching andenlightening as soon as possible the spiritual life of the country._The Ministry:_ The present work must in the interim proceed throughthe Ministry of the People’s Education. Of all the necessaryalterations in its composition and construction the State Commissionwill have charge, elected by the Executive Committee of the Sovietsand the State Committee. Of course the order of State authority inthe domain of the people’s education will be established by theConstituent Assembly. Until then, the Ministry must play the part ofthe executive apparatus for both the State Committee and the StateCommission for People’s Education.The pledge of the country’s safety lies in the cooperation of all itsvital and genuinely democratic forces.We believe that the energetic effort of the working people and of thehonest enlightened intellectuals will lead the country out of itspainful crisis, and through complete democracy to the reign ofSocialism and the brotherhood of nations.                                _People’s Commissar on Education,_                                        A.

MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE. BULLETIN NO. 2November 12th, in the evening, Kerensky sent a proposition to therevolutionary troops—“to lay down their arms.” Kerensky’s men openedartillery fire. Our artillery answered and compelled the enemy to besilent. The Cossacks assumed the offensive. The deadly fire of thesailors, the Red Guards and the soldiers forced the Cossacks toretreat. Our armoured cars rushed in among the ranks of the enemy.The enemy is fleeing. Our troops are in pursuit. The order has beengiven to arrest Kerensky. Tsarskoye Selo has been taken by therevolutionary troops._The Lettish Riflemen:_ The Military Revolutionary Committee hasreceived precise information that the valiant Lettish Riflemen havearrived from the Front and taken up a position in the rear ofKerensky’s bands._From the Staff of the Military Revolutionary Committee_The seizure of Gatchina and Tsarskoye Selo by Kerensky’s detachmentsis to be explained by the complete absence of artillery andmachine-guns in these places, whereas Kerensky’s cavalry was providedwith artillery from the beginning. The last two days were days ofenforced work for our Staff, to provide the necessary quantity ofguns, machine-guns, field telephones, etc., for the revolutionarytroops. When this work—with the energetic assistance of the DistrictSoviets and the factories (the Putilov Works, Obukhov and others)—wasaccomplished, the issue of the expected encounter left no place fordoubt: on the side of the revolutionary troops there was not only asurplus in quantity and such a powerful material base as Petrograd,but also an enormous moral advantage. All the Petrograd regimentsmoved out to the positions with tremendous enthusiasm. The GarrisonConference elected a Control Commission of five soldiers, thussecuring a complete unity between the commander in chief and thegarrison. At the Garrison Conference it was unanimously decided tobegin decisive action.The artillery fire on the 12th of November developed withextraordinary force by 3 P.M. The Cossacks were completelydemoralised. A parliamentarian came from them to the staff of thedetachment at Krasnoye Selo, and proposed to stop the firing,threatening otherwise to take “decisive” measures. He was answeredthat the firing would cease when Kerensky laid down his arms.In the developing encounter all sections of the troops—the sailors,soldiers and the Red Guards—showed unlimited courage. The sailorscontinued to advance until they had fired all their cartridges. Thenumber of casualties has not been established yet, but it is largeron the part of the counter-revolutionary troops, who experiencedgreat losses through one of our armoured cars.Kerensky’s staff, fearing that they would be surrounded, gave theorder to retreat, which retreat speedily assumed a disorderlycharacter. By 11-12 P.M., Tsarkoye Selo, including the wirelessstation, was entirely occupied by the troops of the Soviets. TheCossacks retreated towards Gatchina and Colpinno.The morale of the troops is beyond all praise. The order has beengiven to pursue the retreating Cossacks. From the Tsarskoye Selostation a radio-telegram was sent immediately to the Front and to alllocal Soviets throughout Russia. Further details will becommunicated….                                 2.                    EVENTS OF THE 13TH IN PETROGRADThree regiments of the Petrograd garrison to take any part in thebattle against Kerensky. On the morning of the 13th they summoned toa joint conference sixty delegates from the Front, in order to findsome way to stop the civil war. This conference appointed a committeeto go and persuade Kerensky’s troops to lay down their arms. Theyproposed to ask the Government soldiers the following questions: (1)Will the soldiers and Cossacks of Kerensky recognise the_Tsay-ee-kah_ as the repository of Governmental power, responsible tothe Congress of Soviets? (2) Will the soldiers and Cossacks acceptthe decrees of the second Congress of Soviets? (3) Will they acceptthe Land and Peace decrees? (4) Will they agree to cease hostilitiesand return to their units? (5) Will they consent to the arrest ofKerensky, Krasnov and Savinkov?At the meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, Zinoviev said, “It would befoolish to think that this committee could finish affair. The enemycan only be broken by force. However, it would be a crime for us notto try every peaceful means to bring the Cossacks over to us…. Whatwe need is a military victory…. The news of an armistice ispremature. Our Staff will be ready to conclude an armistice when theenemy can no longer do any harm….“At present, the influence of our victory is creating new politicalconditions…. To-day the Socialist Revolutionaries are inclined areinclined to admit the Bolsheviki into the new Government…. A decisivevictory is indispensable, so that those who hesitate will have nofurther hesitation….”At the City Duma all attention was concentrated on the formation ofthe new Government. In many factories and barracks alreadyRevolutionary Tribunals were operating, and the Bolsheviki werethreatening to set up more of these, and try Gotz and Avksentievbefore them. Dan proposed that an ultimatum be sent demanding theabolition of these Revolutionary Tribunals, or the other members ofthe Conference would immediately break off all negotiations with theBolsheviki.Shingariov, Cadet, declared that the Municipality ought not to takepart in any agreement with the Bolsheviki…. “Any agreement with themaniacs is impossible until they lay down their arms and recognisethe authority of independent courts of law….”Yartsev, for the _Yedinstvo_ group, declared that any agreement withthe Bolsheviki would be equivalent to a Bolshevik victory….Mayor Schreider, for the Socialist Revolutionaries, stated that hewas opposed to all agreement with the Bolsheviki…. “As for aGovernment, that ought to spring from the popular will; and since thepopular will has been expressed in the municipal elections, thepopular will which can create a Government is actually concentratedin the Duma….”After other speakers, of which only the representative of theMensheviki Internationalists was in favour of considering theadmission of the Bolsheviki into the new Government, the Duma votedto continue its representatives in the _Vikzhel’s_ conference, but toinsist upon the restoration of the Provisional Government beforeeverything, and to exclude the Bolsheviki from the new power….                                 3.        TRUCE. KRASNOV’s ANSWER TO THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION“In answer to your telegram proposing an immediate armistice, theSupreme Commander, not wishing further futile bloodshed, consents toenter into negotiations and to establish relations between the armiesof the Government and the insurrectionists. He proposes to theGeneral Staff of the insurrectionists to recall its regiments toPetrograd, to declare the line Ligovo-Pulkovo-Colpinno neutral, andto allow the advance-guards of the Government cavalry to enterTsarskoye Selo, for the purpose of establishing order. The answer tothis proposal must be placed in the hands of our envoys before eighto’clock to-morrow morning.                                                KRASNOV.”                                 4.                        EVENTS AT TSARSKOYE SELOOn the evening that Kerensky’s troops retreated from Tsarskoye Selo,some priests organised a religious procession through the streets ofthe town, making speeches to the citizens in which they asked thepeople to support the rightful authority, the Provisional Government.When the Cossacks had retreated, and the first Red Guards entered thetown, witnesses reported that the priests had incited the peopleagainst the Soviets, and had said prayers at the grave of Rasputin,which lies behind the Imperial Palace. One of the priests, FatherIvan Kutchurov, was arrested and shot by the infuriated Red Guards….Just as the Red Guards entered the town the electric lights were shutoff, plunging the streets in complete darkness. The director of theelectric light plant, Lubovitch, was arrested by the Soviet troopsand asked why he had shut off the lights. He was found some timelater in the room where he had been imprisoned with a revolver in hishand and a bullet hole in his temple.The Petrograd anti-Bolshevik papers came out next day with headlines,“Plekhanov’s temperature 39 degrees!” Plekhanov lived at TsarskoyeSelo, where he was lying ill in bed. Red Guards arrived at the houseand searched it for arms, questioning the old man.“What class of society do you belong to?” they asked him.“I am a revolutionist,” answered Plekhanov, “who for forty years hasdevoted his life to the struggle for liberty!”“Anyway,” said a workman, “you have now sold yourself to thebourgeoisie!”The workers no longer knew Plekhanov, pioneer of the Russian SocialDemocracy!                                 5.                    APPEAL OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT“The detachments at Gatchina, deceived by Kerensky, have laid downtheir arms and decided to arrest Kerensky. That chief of thecounter-revolutionary campaign has fled. The Army, by an enormousmajority, has pronounced in favour of the second All-Russian Congressof Soviets, and of the Government which it has created. Scores ofdelegates from the Front have hastened to Petrograd to assure theSoviet Government of the Army’s fidelity. No twisting of the facts,no calumny against the revolutionary workers, soldiers, and peasants,has been able to defeat the People. The Workers’ and Soldiers’Revolution is victorious….“The _Tsay-ee-kah_ appeals to the troops which march under the flagof the counter-revolution, and invites them immediately to lay downtheir arms—to shed no longer the blood of their brothers in theinterests of a handful of land-owners and capitalists. The Workers’,Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Revolution curses those who remain even for amoment under the flag of the People’s enemies….“Cossacks! Come over to the rank of the victorious People!Railwaymen, postmen, telegraphers—all, all support the new Governmentof the People!”                        APPENDIX TO CHAPTER X                                 1.                        DAMAGE TO THE KREMLINI myself verified the damage to the Kremlin, which I visitedimmediately after the bombardment. The Little Nicolai Palace, abuilding of no particular importance, which was occupied occasionallyby receptions of one of the Grand Duchesses, had served as barracksfor the _yunkers._ It was not only bombarded, but pretty well sacked;fortunately there was nothing in it of particular historical value.Usspensky Cathedral had a shell-hole in one of the cupolas, butexcept for a few feet of mosaic in the ceiling, was undamaged. Thefrescoes on the porch of Blagovestchensky Cathedral were badlydamaged by a shell. Another shell hit the corner of Ivan Veliki.Tchudovsky Monastery was hit about thirty times, but only one shellwent through a window into the interior, the others breaking thebrick window-moulding and the roof cornices.The clock over the Spasskaya Gate was smashed. Troitsky Gate wasbattered, but easily reparable. One of the lower towers had lost itsbrick spire.The church of St. Basil was untouched, as was the great ImperialPalace, with all the treasures of Moscow and Petrograd in its cellar,and the crown jewels in the Treasury. These places were not evenentered.                                 2.                        LUNATCHARSKY’s DECLARATION“Comrades! You are the young masters of the country, and although nowyou have much to do and think about, you must know how to defend yourartistic and scientific treasures.“Comrades! That which is happening at Moscow is a horrible,irreparable misfortune…. The People in its struggle for the power hasmutilated our glorious capital.“It is particularly terrible in these days of violent struggle, ofdestructive warfare, to be Commissar of Public Education. Only thehope of the victory of Socialism, the source of a new and superiorculture, brings me comfort. On me weighs the responsibility ofprotecting the artistic wealth of the people…. Not being able toremain at my post, where I had no influence, I resigned. My comrades,the other Commissars, considered this resignation inadmissible. Ishall therefore remain at my post…. And moreover, I understand thatthe damage done to the Kremlin is not as serious as has beenreported….“But I beg you, comrades, to give me your support…. Preserve foryourselves and your descendants the beauty of our land; be theguardians of the property of the People.“Soon, very soon, even the most ignorant, who have been held inignorance so long, will awake and understand what a source of joy,strength and wisdom is art….”                                 3.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS CHAPTERThis chapter extends over a period of two months, more or less. Itcovers the time of negotiations with the Allies, the negotiations andarmistice with the Germans, and the beginning of the Peacenegotiations at Brest-Litovsk, as well as the period in which werelaid the foundations of the Soviet State.However, it is no part of my purpose in this book to describe andinterpret these very important historical events, which require morespace. They are therefore reserved for another volume, "Kornilov toBrest-Litovsk."In this chapter, then, I have confined myself to the SovietGovernment's attempts to consolidate its political power at home, andsketched its successive conquests of hostile domestic elements—whichprocess was temporarily interrupted by the disastrous Peace ofBrest-Litovsk.                                 2.        PREAMBLE—DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIAThe October Revolution of the workers and peasants began under thecommon banner of Emancipation.The peasants are being emancipated from the power of the landowners,for there is no longer the landowner's property right in the land—ithas been abolished. The soldiers and sailors are being emancipatedfrom the power of autocratic generals, for generals will henceforthbe elective and subject to recall. The workingmen are beingemancipated from the whims and arbitrary will of the capitalists, forhenceforth there will be established the control of the workers overmills and factories. Everything living and capable of life is beingemancipated from the hateful shackles.There remain only the peoples of Russia, who have suffered and aresuffering oppression and arbitrariness, and whose emancipation mustimmediately be begun, whose liberation must be effected resolutelyand definitely.During the period of Tsarism the peoples of Russia weresystematically incited against one another. The result of such apolicy are known: massacres and _pogroms_ on the one hand, slavery ofpeoples on the other.There can be and there must be no return to this disgraceful policy.Henceforth the policy of a voluntary and honest union of the peoplesof Russia must be substituted.In the period of imperialism, after the March revolution, when thepower was transferred into the hands of the Cadet bourgeoisie, thenaked policy of provocation gave way to one of cowardly distrust ofthe peoples of Russia, to a policy of fault-finding, of meaningless"freedom" and "equality" of peoples. The results of such a policy areknown: the growth of national enmity, the impairment of mutualconfidence.An end must be put to this unworthy policy of falsehood and distrust,of fault-finding and provocation. Henceforth it must be replaced byan open and honest policy leading to the complete mutual confidenceof the peoples of Russia. Only as the result of such a trust canthere be formed an honest and lasting union of the peoples of Russia.Only as the result of such a union can the workers and peasants ofthe peoples of Russia be cemented into one revolutionary force ableto resist all attempts on the part of the imperialist-annexationistbourgeoisie.                                 3.                              DECREES                _On the Nationalisation of the Banks_In the interest of the regular organisation of the national economy,of the thorough eradication of bank speculation and the completeemancipation of the workers, peasants, and the whole labouringpopulation from the exploitation of banking capital, and with a viewto the establishment of a single national bank of the RussianRepublic which shall serve the real interests of the people and thepoorer classes, the Central Executive Committee _(Tsay-ee-kah)_resolves:1. The banking business is declared a state monopoly.2. All existing private joint-stock banks and banking offices aremerged in the State Bank.3. The assets and liabilities of the liquidated establishments aretaken over by the State Bank.4. The order of the merger of private banks in the State Bank is tobe determined by a special decree.5. The temporary administration of the affairs of the private banksis entrusted to the board of the State Bank.6. The interests of the small depositors will be safeguarded.                        *   *   *   *   *                _On the Equality of Rank of All Military Men_In realisation of the will of the revolutionary people regarding theprompt and decisive abolition of all remnants of former inequality inthe Army, the Council of People's Commissars decrees:1. All ranks and grades in the Army, beginning with the rank ofCorporal and ending with the rank of General, are abolished. The Armyof the Russian Republic consists now of free and equal citizens,bearing the honourable title of Soldiers of the Revolutionary Army.2. All privileges connected with the former ranks and grades, alsoall outward marks of distinction, are abolished.3. All addressing by titles is abolished.4. All decorations, orders, and other marks of distinction areabolished.5. With the abolition of the rank of officer, all separate officers'organisations are abolished.Note.—Orderlies are left only for headquarters, chanceries,Committees and other Army organisations.                _President of the Council of People's Commissars,_                                        VL.

The army serving the will of the toiling people is subject to itssupreme representative—the Council of People's Commissars.2. Full authority within the limits of military units andcombinations is vested in the respective Soldiers' Committees andSoviets.3. Those phases of the life and activity of the troops which arealready under the jurisdiction of the Committees are now formallyplaced in their direct control. Over such branches of activity whichthe Committees cannot assume, the control of the Soldiers' Soviets isestablished.4. The election of commanding Staff and officers is introduced. Allcommanders up to the commanders of regiments, inclusive, are electedby general suffrage of squads, platoons, companies, squadrons,batteries, divisions (artillery, 2-3 batteries), and regiments. Allcommanders higher than the commander of a regiment, and up to theSupreme Commander, inclusive, are elected by congresses orconferences of Committees.Note.—By the term "conference" must be understood a meeting of therespective Committees together with delegates of committees onedegree lower in rank. (Such as a "conference" of RegimentalCommittees with delegates from Company Committees.—Author.)5.

RIDICULE OF THE NEW RÉGIME        From _Drug Naroda_ (Menshevik), November 18th:"The story of the 'immediate peace' of the Bolsheviki reminds us of ajoyous moving-picture film…. Neratov runs—Trotzky pursues; Neratovclimbs a wall, Trotzky too; Neratov dives into the water—Trotzkyfollows; Neratov climbs onto the roof—Trotzky right behind him;Neratov hides under the bed—and Trotzky has him! He has him!Naturally, peace is immediately signed…."All is empty and silent at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thecouriers are respectful, but their faces wear a caustic expression…."How about arresting an ambassador and signing an armistice or aPeace Treaty with him? But they are strange folk, these ambassadors.They keep silent just as if they had heard nothing. Hola, hola,England, France, Germany! We have signed an armistice with you! Is itpossible that you know nothing about it? Nevertheless, it has beenpublished in all the papers and posted on all the walls. On aBolshevik's word of honour, Peace has been signed. We're not askingmuch of you; you just have to write two words…."The ambassadors remain silent. The Powers remain silent. All isempty and silent in the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs."'Listen,' says Robespierre-Trotzky to his assistant Marat-Uritzky,'run over to the British Ambassador's, tell him we're proposingpeace!'"'Go yourself,' says Marat-Uritzky. 'He's not receiving.'"'Telephone him, then.'"'I've tried. The receiver's off the hook.'"'Send him a telegram.'"'I did.'"'Well, with what result?'"Marat-Uritzky sighs and does not answer. Robespierre-Trotzky spitsfuriously into the corner…."'Listen, Marat,' recommences Trotzky, after a moment. 'We mustabsolutely show that we're conducting an active foreign policy. Howcan we do that?'"'Launch another decree about arresting Neratov,' answers Uritzky,with a profound air."'Marat, you're a blockhead!' cries Trotzky. All of a sudden hearises, terrible and majestic, looking at this moment likeRobespierre."'Write, Uritzky!' he says with severity. 'Write a letter to theBritish ambassador, a registered letter with receipt demanded. Write!I also will write! The peoples of the world await an immediate peace!'"In the enormous and empty Ministry of Foreign Affairs are to beheard only the sound of two typewriters. With his own hands Trotzkyis conducting an active foreign policy…."                                 6.                ON THE QUESTION OF AN AGREEMENTTo the Attention of All Workers and All Soldiers.November 11th, in the club of the Preobrazhensky Regiment, was heldan extraordinary meeting of representatives of all the units of thePetrograd garrison.The meeting was called upon the initiative of the Preobrazhensky andSemionovsky Regiments, for the discussion of the question as to whichSocialist parties are for the power of the Soviets, which areagainst, which are for the people, which against, and if an agreementbetween them is possible.The representatives of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ of the Municipal Duma, ofthe Avksentiev Peasants' Soviets, and of all the political partiesfrom the Bolsheviki to the Populist Socialists, were invited to themeeting.After long deliberation, having heard the declarations of all partiesand organisations, the meeting by a tremendous majority of votesagreed that only the Bolsheviki and the Left SocialistRevolutionaries are for the people, and that all the other partiesare only attempting, under cover of seeking an agreement, to deprivethe people of the conquests won in the days of the great Workers' andPeasants' Revolution of November.Here is the text of the resolution carried at this meeting of thePetrograd garrison, by 61 votes against 11, and 12 not voting:"The garrison conference, summoned at the initiative of theSemionovsky and Preobrazhensky Regiments, on hearing therepresentatives of all the Socialist parties and popularorganisations on the question of an agreement between the differentpolitical parties finds that:"1. The representatives of the _Tasy-ee-kah,_ the representatives ofthe Bolshevik party and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, declareddefinitely that they stand for a Government of the Soviets, for thedecrees on Land, Peace and Workers' Control of Industry, and thatupon this platform they are willing to agree with all the Socialistparties."2. At the same time the representatives of the other parties(Mensheviki, Socialist Revolutionaries) either gave no answer at all,or declared simply that they were opposed to the power of the Sovietsand against the decrees on Land, Peace and Workers' Control."In view of this the meeting resolves:"'1. To express severe censure of all parties which, under cover ofan agreement, wish practically to annul the popular conquests of theRevolution of November."2. To express full confidence in the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and the Councilof People's Commissars, and to promise them complete support.'"At the same time the meeting deems it necessary that the comradesLeft Socialist Revolutionaries should enter the People's Government."                                 7.                           WINE "POGROMS"It was afterward discovered that there was a regular organisation,maintained by the Cadets, for provoking rioting among the soldiers.There would be telephone messages to the different barracks,announcing that wine was being given away at such and such anaddress, and when the soldiers arrived at the spot an individualwould point out the location of the cellar….The Council of People's Commissars appointed a Commissar for theFight Against Drunkenness, who, besides mercilessly putting down thewine riots, destroyed hundreds of thousands of bottles of liquor. TheWinter Palace cellars, containing rare vintages valued at more thanfive million dollars, were at first flooded, and then the liquor wasremoved to Cronstadt and destroyed.In this work the Cronstadt sailors, "flower and pride of therevolutionary forces," as Trotzky called them, acquitted themselveswith iron selfdicipline….                                 8.

The city is cut off fromthe outside world and is entirely in the power of the Bolsheviki….People are arrested in the streets, thrown into the Neva, drowned andimprisoned without any charge. Even Burtzev is shut up in Peter-Paulfortress, under strict guard."The organisation at whose head I am is working without rest to uniteall the officers and what is left of the _yunker_ schools, and to armthem. The situation cannot be saved except by creating regiments ofofficers and _yunkers._ Attacking with these regiments, and havinggained a first success, we could later gain the aid of the garrisontroops; but without that first success it is impossible to count on asingle soldier, because thousands of them are divided and terrorisedby the scum which exists in every regiment. Most of the Cossacks aretainted by Bolshevik propaganda, thanks to the strange policy ofGeneral Dutov, who allowed to pass the moment when by decisive actionsomething could have been obtained. The policy of negotiations andconcessions has borne its fruits; all that is respectable ispersecuted, and it is the _plebe_ and the criminals who dominate—andnothing can be done except by shooting and hanging them."We are awaiting you here, General, and at the moment of yourarrival, we shall advance with all the forces at our disposal. Butfor that we must establish some communication with you, and beforeall, clear up the following points:"(1) Do you know that in your name all officers who could take partin the fight are being invited to leave Petrograd on the pretext ofjoining you?"(2) About when can we count on your arrival at Petrograd? We shouldlike to know in order to coordinate our actions."In spite of the criminal inaction of the conscious people here,which allowed the yoke of Bolshevism to be laid upon us—in spite ofthe extraordinary pig—headedness of the majority of officers, sodifficult to organise— we believe in spite of all that Truth is onour side, and that we shall conquer the vicious and criminal forceswho say that they are acting for motives of love of country and inorder to save it. Whatever comes, we shall not permit ourselves to bestruck down, and shall remain firm until the end."Purishkevitch, being brought to trial before the RevolutionaryTribunal, was given a short prison term….                                10.

Every conscious worker understandsperfectly that we cannot avoid this hostility, because the highofficials have set themselves against the People and do not wish toabandon their posts without resistance.

We have justice on our side. Ourultimate victory is certain."The resistance of the capitalists and high officials will be broken.No one will be deprived of his property without a special law on thenationalisation of banks and financial syndicates. This law is inpreparation. Not a worker will lose a single kopek; on the contrary,he will be assisted.

Remember that you yourselves direct theGovernment. No one will help you unless you organise yourselves andtake into your own hands the affairs of the State. Your Soviets arenow the organs of governmental power…. Strengthen them, establish asevere revolutionary control, pitilessly crush the attempts atanarchy on the part of drunkards, brigands, counter-revolutionary_yunkers_ and Kornilovists."Establish a strict control over production and the accounting forproducts. Arrest and turn over to the Revolutionary Tribunal of thePeople every one who injures the property of the People, by sabotagein production, by concealment of grain-reserves, reserves of otherproducts, by retarding the shipments of grain, by bringing confusioninto the railroads, the posts and the telegraphs, or in generalopposing the great work of bringing Peace and transferring the Landto the peasants…."Comrades workers, soldiers, peasants—all toilers!"Take immediately all local power into your hands…. Little by little,with the consent of the majority of peasants, we shall march firmlyand unhesitatingly toward the victory of Socialism, which willfortify the advance-guards of the working-class of the most civilisedCountries, and give to the peoples an enduring peace, and free themfrom every slavery and every exploitation."                                13._"To All Workers of Petrograd!_"Comrades! The Revolution is winning—the revolution has won. All thepower has passed over to our Soviets. The first weeks are the mostdifficult ones.

FROM THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARS TO THE TOILING COSSACKS_“Brothers-Cossacks._“You are being deceived. You are being incited against the People.You are told that the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’Deputies are your enemies, that they want to take away your Cossackland, your Cossack ‘liberty’. Don’t believe it, Cossacks…. Your ownGenerals and landowners are deceiving you, in order to keep you indarkness and slavery.  We, the Council of People’s Commissars,address ourselves to you, Cossacks, with these words. Read themattentively and judge yourselves which is the truth and which iscruel deceit. The life and service of a Cossack were always bondageand penal servitude. At the first call of the authorities a Cossackalways had to saddle his horse and ride out on campaign. All hismilitary equipment a Cossack had to provide with his own hardlyearned means. A Cossack is on service, his farm is going to rack andruin. Is such a condition fair? No, it must be altered for ever. THECOSSACKS MUST BE FREED FROM BONDAGE. The new People’s Soviet power iswilling to come to the assistance of the toiling Cossacks. It is onlynecessary that the Cossacks themselves should resolve to abolish theold order, that they should refuse submission to their slave-driverofficers, land-owners, rich men, that they should throw off thecursed yoke from their necks. Arise, Cossacks! Unite! The Council ofPeople’s Commissars calls upon you to enter a new, fresh, more happylife.“In November and December in Petrograd there were All-RussianCongresses of Soviets of Soldiers’, Workers’, and Peasants’ Deputies.These Congresses transferred all the authority in the differentlocalities into the hands of the Soviets, i.e., into the hands of menelected by the People. From now on there must be in Russia no rulersor functionaries who command the People from above and drive them.The People create the authority themselves. A General has no morerights than a soldier. All are equal. Consider, Cossacks, is thiswrong or right? We are calling upon you, Cossacks, to join this neworder and to create your own Soviets of Cossacks’ Deputies. To suchSoviets all the power must belong in the different localities. Not to_hetmans_ with the rank of General, but to the electedrepresentatives of the toiling Cossacks, to your own trustworthyreliable men.“The All-Russian Congresses of Soldiers’, Workers’, and Peasants’Deputies have passed a resolution to transfer all landowners’ landinto the possession of the toiling people. Is not that fair,Cossacks? The Kornilovs, Kaledins, Dutovs, Karaulovs, Bardizhes, alldefend with their whole souls the interests of the rich men, and theyare ready to drown Russia in blood if only the lands remain in thehands of the landowners. But you, the toiling Cossacks, do not yousuffer yourselves from poverty, oppression and lack of land? How manyCossacks are there who have more than 4-5 _dessiatins_ per head? Butthe landowners, who have thousands of _dessiatins_ of their own land,wish besides to get into their hands the lands of the Cossack Army.According to the new Soviet laws, the lands of Cossack landownersmust pass without compensation into the hands of the Cossack workers,the poorer Cossacks. You are being told that the Soviets wish to takeaway your lands from you. Who is frightening you? The rich Cossacks,who know that the Soviet AUTHORITY WISHES TO transfer the landowners’lands to you. Choose then, Cossacks, for whom will you stand: for theKornilovs and Kaledins, for the Generals and rich men, or for theSoviets of Peasants’, Soldiers’, Workers’ and Cossacks’ Deputies.“THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARS elected by the All-RussianCongress HAS PROPOSED TO ALL NATIONS AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE AND ANHONOURABLE DEMOCRATIC PEACE WITHOUT LOSS OR DETRIMENT TO ANY NATION.All the capitalists, landowners, Generals-Kornilovists have risenagainst the peaceful policy of the Soviets. The war was bringing themprofits, power, distinctions. And to you, Cossack privates? You wereperishing without reason, without purpose, like yourbrothers-soldiers and sailors. It will soon be three years and a halfthat this accursed war has gone on, a war devised by the capitalistsand landowners of all countries for their own profit, their worldrobberies. To the toiling Cossacks the war has only brought ruin anddeath. The war has drained all the resources from Cossack farm life.The only salvation for the whole of our country and for the Cossacksin  particular is a prompt and honest peace. The Council of People’sCommissars has declared to all Governments and peoples: We do notwant other people’s property, and we do not wish to give away ourown. Peace without annexations and without indemnities. Every nationmust decide its own fate. There must be no oppressing of one nationby another. Such is the honest, democratic, People’s peace which theCouncil of People’s Commissars is proposing to all Governments, toall peoples, allies and enemies. And the results are visible: ON THERUSSIAN FRONT AN ARMISTICE HAS BEEN CONCLUDED.“The soldier’s and the Cossack’s blood is not flowing there any more.Now, Cossacks, decide: do you wish to continue this ruinous,senseless, criminal slaughter? Then support the Cadets, the enemiesof the people, support Tchernov, Tseretelli, Skobeliev, who drove youinto the offensive of July 1st; support Kornilov, who introducedcapital punishment for soldiers and Cossacks at the front. BUT IF YOUWISH A PROMPT AND HONEST PEACE, THEN ENTER THE RANKS OF THE SOVIETSAND SUPPORT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’s COMMISSARS.“Your fate, Cossacks, lies in your own hands. Our common foes, thelandowners, capitalists, officers-Kornilovists, bourgeois newspapers,are deceiving you and driving you along the road to ruin. InOrenburg, Dutov has arrested the Soviet and disarmed the garrison.Kaledin is threatening the Soviets in the province of the Don. He hasdeclared the province to be in a state of war and is assembling histroops. Karaulov is shooting the local tribes in the Caucasus. TheCadet bourgeoisie is supplying them with its millions. Their commonaim is to suppress the People’s Soviets, to crush the workers andpeasants, to introduce again the discipline of the whip in the army,and to eternalise the bondage of the toiling Cossacks.“Our revolutionary troops are moving to the Don and the Ural in orderto put an end to this criminal revolt against the people. Thecommanders of the revolutionary troops have received orders not toenter into any negotiations with the mutinous Generals, to actdecisively and mercilessly.“Cossacks! On you depends now whether your brothers’ blood is to flowstill. We are holding out our hand to you. Join the whole peopleagainst its enemies. Declare Kaledin, Kornilov, Dutov, Karaulov andall their aiders and abettors to be the enemies of the people,traitors and betrayers. Arrest them with your own forces and turnthem over into the hands of the Soviet authority, which will judgethem in open and public Revolutionary Tribunal. Cossacks! FormSoviets of Cossacks’ Deputies. Take into your toil-worn hands themanagement of all the affairs of the Cossacks. Take away the lands ofyour own wealthy landowners. Take over their grain, their inventoriedproperty and live-stock for the cultivation of the lands of thetoiling Cossacks, who are ruined by the war.“Forward, Cossacks, to the fight for the common cause of the people!“Long live the toiling Cossacks!“Long live the union of the Cossacks, the soldiers, peasants andworkers!“Long live the power of the Soviets of Cossacks’, Soldiers’, Workers’and Peasants’ Deputies.“Down with the war! Down with the landowners and theKornilovist-Generals!“Long live Peace and the Brotherhood of peoples!”                                _Council of People’s Commissars._                                17.    FROM THE COMMISSION ON PUBLIC EDUCATION ATTACHED TO THE CENTRAL                            CITY DUMA“Comrades Workingmen and Workingwomen!“A few days before the holidays, a strike has been declared by theteachers of the public schools. The teachers side with thebourgeoisie against the Workers’ and Peasants’ Government.“Comrades, organise parents’ committees and pass resolutions againstthe strike of the teachers. Propose to the Ward Soviets of Workers’and Soldiers’ Deputies, the Trade Unions, the Factory-Shop and PartyCommittees, to organise protest meetings. Arrange with your ownresources Christmas trees and entertainments for the children, anddemand the opening of the schools, after the holidays, at the datewhich will be set by the Duma.“Comrades, strengthen your position in matters of public education,insist on the control of the proletarian organisations over theschools.”      _Commission on Public Education attached to the Central City Duma._                                18.        DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENTThe notes issued by Trotzky to the Allies and to the neutral powers,as well as the note of the Allied military Attachés to GeneralDukhonin, are too voluminous to give here. Moreover they belong toanother phase of the history of the Soviet Republic, with which thisbook has nothing to do—the foreign relations of the SovietGovernment. This I treat at length in the next volume, “Kornilov toBrest-Litovsk.”                                19.                APPEALS TO THE FRONT AGAINST DUKHONIN“… The struggle for peace has met with the resistance of thebourgeoisie and the counter-revolutionary Generals…. From theaccounts in the newspapers, at the _Stavka_ of former SupremeCommander Dukhonin are gathering the agents and allies of thebourgeoisie, Verkhovski, Avksentiev, Tchernov, Gotz, Tseretelli, etc.It seems even that they want to form a new power against the Soviets.“Comrades soldiers! All the persons we have mentioned have beenMinisters already. They have acted in accord with Kerensky and thebourgeoisie. They are responsible for the offensive of July 1st andfor the prolongation of the war. They promised the land to thepeasants and then arrested the Land Committees. They reestablishedcapital punishment for soldiers. They obey the orders of French,English and American financiers….“General Dukhonin, for having refused to obey orders of the Councilof People’s Commissars, has been dismissed from his position asSupreme Commander…. For answer he is circulating among the troops thenote from the Military Attachés of the Allied imperialist Powers, andattempting to provoke a counter-revolution….“Do not obey Dukhonin! Pay no attention to his provocation! Watch himand his group of counter-revolutionary Generals carefully….”                                20.                            FROM KRYLENKO                           _Order Number Two_“… The ex-Supreme Commander, General Dukhonin, for having opposedresistance to the execution of orders, for criminal actionsusceptible of provoking a new civil war, is declared enemy of thePeople. All persons who support Dukhonin will be arrested, withoutrespect to their social or political position or their past. Personsequipped with special authority will operate these arrests. I chargeGeneral Manikhovsky with the execution of the above-mentioneddispositions….”                     APPENDIX TO CHAPTER XII                                 1.                     INSTRUCTION TO PEASANTSIn answer to the numerous enquiries coming from peasants, it ishereby explained that the whole power in the country is from now onheld by the Soviets of the Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’Deputies. The Workers’ Revolution, after having conquered inPetrograd and in Moscow, is now conquering in all other centres ofRussia. The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government safeguards theinterests of the masses of peasantry, the poorest of them; it is withthe majority of peasants and workers against the landowners, andagainst the capitalists.Hence the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, and before all the DistrictSoviets, and subsequently those of the Provinces, are from now on anduntil the Constituent Assembly meets, full-powered bodies of Stateauthority in their localities. All landlords’ titles to the land arecancelled by the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets. A decreeregarding the land has already been issued by the present ProvisionalWorkers’ and Peasants’ Government. On the basis of the above decreeall lands hitherto belonging to landlords now pass entirely andwholly into the hands of the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies. The_Volost_ (a group of several villages forms a _Volost_) LandCommittees are immediately to take over all land from the landlords,and to keep a strict account over it, watching that order bemaintained, and that the whole estate be well guarded, seeing thatfrom now on all private estates become public property and musttherefore be protected by the people themselves.All orders given by the _Volost_ Land Committees, adopted with theassent of the District Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, in fulfilmentof the decrees issued by the revolutionary power, are absolutelylegal and are to be forthwith and irrefutably brought into execution.The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government appointed by the secondAll-Russian Congress of Soviets has received the name of the Councilof People’s Commissars.The Council of People’s Commissars summons the Peasants to take thewhole power into their hands in every locality.The workers will in every way absolutely and entirely support thepeasants, arrange for them all that is required in connection withmachines and tools, and in return they request the peasants to helpwith the transport of grain.                  _President of the Council of People’s Commissars,_                                       V. ULIANOV (LENIN).Petrograd, November 18th, 1917.                                 2.The full-powered Congress of Peasants’ Soviets met about a weeklater, and continued for several weeks. Its history is merely anexpanded version of the history of the “Extraordinary Conference.” Atfirst the great majority of the delegates were hostile to the SovietGovernment, and supported the reactionary wing. Several days laterthe assembly was supporting the moderates with Tchernov. And severaldays after that the vast majority of the Congress were voting for thefaction of Maria Spiridonova, and sending their representatives intothe _Tsay-ee-kah_ at Smolny…. The Right Wing then walked out of theCongress and called a Congress of its own, which went on, dwindlingfrom day to day, until it finally dissolved….THE JUNIOR CLASSICSSELECTED AND ARRANGED BYWILLIAM PATTEN, MANAGING EDITOR OF THE HARVARD CLASSICSINTRODUCTION BY CHARLES W. ELIOT, LL.D., PRESIDENT EMERITUS OF HARVARDUNIVERSITYWITH A READING GUIDE BY WILLIAM ALLAN NEILSON, Ph. D., PROFESSOR OFENGLISH, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, PRESIDENT SMITH COLLEGE, NORTHAMPTON,MASS., SINCE 1917VOLUME ONEFairy and Wonder TalesINTRODUCTIONThe purpose of The Junior Classics is to provide, in ten volumescontaining about five thousand pages, a classified collection of tales,stories, and poems, both ancient and modern, suitable for boys andgirls of from six to sixteen years of age.  Thoughtful parents andteachers, who realize the evils of indiscriminate reading on the partof children, will appreciate the educational value of such acollection.  A child's taste in reading is formed, as a rule, in thefirst ten or twelve years of its life, and experience has shown thatthe childish mind will prefer good literature to any other, if accessto it is made easy, and will develop far better on literature of provedmerit than on trivial or transitory material.The boy or girl who becomes familiar with the charming tales and poemsin this collection will have gained a knowledge of literature andhistory that will be of high value in other school and home work.  Hereare the real elements of imaginative narration, poetry, and ethics,which should enter into the education of every English-speaking child.This collection, carefully used by parents and teachers with duereference to individual tastes and needs, will make many children enjoygood literature.  It will inspire them with a love of good reading,which is the best possible result of any elementary education.  Thechild himself should be encouraged to make his own selections from thislarge and varied collection, the child's enjoyment being the object inview.  A real and lasting interest in literature or in scholarship isonly to be developed through the individual's enjoyment of his mentaloccupations.The most important change which has been made in American schools andcolleges within my memory is the substitution of leading for driving,of inspiration for drill, of personal interest and love of work forcompulsion and fear.  The schools are learning to use methods andmaterials which interest and attract the children themselves.  TheJunior Classics will put into the home the means of using this happymethod.Committing to memory beautiful pieces of literature, either prose orpoetry, for recitation before a friendly audience, acting charades orplays, and reading aloud with vivacity and sympathetic emotion, aregood means of instruction at home or at school This collection containsnumerous admirable pieces of literature for such use.  In teachingEnglish and English literature we should place more reliance uponprocesses and acts which awaken emotion, stimulate interest, prove tobe enjoyable for the actors, and result in giving children the power ofentertaining people, of blessing others with noble pleasures which thechildren create and share.>From the home training during childhood there should result in thechild a taste for interesting and improving reading which will directand inspire its subsequent intellectual life.  The training whichresults in this taste for good reading, however unsystematic oreccentric it may have been, has achieved one principal aim ofeducation; and any school or home training which does not result inimplanting this permanent taste has failed in a very important respect.Guided and animated by this impulse to acquire knowledge and exercisethe imagination through good reading, the adult will continue toeducate him all through life.The story of the human race through all its slow development should begradually conveyed to the child's mind from the time he begins to read,or to listen to his mother reading; and with description of facts andactual events should be mingled charming and uplifting products of theimagination.  To try to feed the minds of children upon facts alone isundesirable and unwise.  The immense product of the imagination in artand literature is a concrete fact with which every educated human beingshould be made somewhat familiar, that product being a very real partof every individual's actual environment.The right selection of reading matter for children is obviously of highimportance.  Some of the mythologies, Old Testament stories, fairytales, and historical romances, on which earlier generations wereaccustomed to feed the childish mind, contain a great deal that isbarbarous, perverse, or cruel; and to this infiltration into children'sminds, generation after generation, of immoral, cruel, or foolish ideasis probably to be attributed in part the slow ethical progress of therace.  The commonest justification of this thoughtless practice is thatchildren do not apprehend the evil in the bad mental pictures withwhich we foolishly supply them; but what should we think of a motherwho gave her children dirty milk or porridge, on the theory that thechildren would not assimilate the dirt?  Should we be less carefulabout mental and moral food materials?  The Junior Classics have beenselected with this principle in mind, without losing sight of the factthat every developing human being needs to have a vision of the roughand thorny road over which the human race has been slowly advancingduring thousands of years.Whoever has committed to memory in childhood such Bible extracts asGenesis i, the Ten Commandments, Psalm xxiii, Matthew v, 8-12, TheLord's Prayer, and I Corinthians xiii, such English prose as Lincoln'sGettysburg speech, Bacon's "Essay on Truth," and such poems as Bryant's"Waterfowl," Addison's "Divine Ode," Milton's Sonnet on his Blindness,Wotton's "How happy is he born or taught," Emerson's "Rhodora,"Holmes's "Chambered Nautilus," and Gray's Elegy, and has stamped themon his brain by frequent repetition, will have set up in his mind highstandards of noble thought and feeling, true patriotism, and purereligion.  He will also have laid in an invaluable store of goodEnglish.While the majority of the tales and poems are intended for children whohave begun to do their own reading, there will be found in every volumeselections fit for reading aloud to younger children.  Throughout thecollection the authors tell the stories in their own words; so that thesalt which gave them savor is preserved.  There are some condensationshowever, such as any good teller of borrowed stories would make; but asa rule condensation has been applied only in the case of long workswhich otherwise could not have been included.  The notes which precedethe condensations supply explanations, and answer questions whichexperience has shown boys and girls are apt to ask about the workscondensed or their authors.The Junior Classics constitute a set of books whose contents willdelight children and at the same time satisfy the legitimate ethicalrequirements of those who have the children's best interests at heart.Charles W.

There must have been fairy tales (or fables, or folktales, or myths, or whatever name we choose to give them) ever sincethe world began.  They are not exclusively French, German, Greek,Russian, Indian or Chinese, but are the common property of the wholehuman family and are as universal as human speech.All the world over, fairy tales are found to be pretty much the same.The story of Cinderella is found in all countries.  Japan has a Rip VanWinkle, China has a Beauty and the Beast, Egypt has a Puss in Boots,and Persia has a Jack and the Beanstalk.Those wise people who have made a careful study of literature, andespecially of what we call folk tales or fairy tales or fables ormyths, tell us that they all typify in some way the constant strugglethat is going on in every department of life.  It may be the struggleof Summer against Winter, the bright Day against dark Night, Innocenceagainst Cruelty, of Knowledge against Ignorance.  We are not obliged tothink of these delightful stories as each having a meaning.  Ourenjoyment of them will not be less if we overlook that side, but it mayhelp us to understand and appreciate good books if we remember that theliterature of the world is the story of man's struggle against nature;that the beginnings of literature came out of the mouths of story-tellers, and that the stories they told were fairy tales-imaginativestories based on truth.There is one important fact to remember in connection with the oldfairy tales, and that is that they were repeated aloud from memory, notread from a book or manuscript.The printing of books from type may be said to date from the year 1470,when Caxton introduced printing into England.  It is said that thefirst book printed in English which had the pages numbered was a bookof tales, "Aesop's Fables."As late as 1600 printed books were still so rare that only rich mencould own them.  There was one other way of printing a story-onsheepskin (split and made into parchment) with a pen-but that was along and laborious art that could only be practiced by educated men whohad been taught to write.  The monks were about the only men who hadthe necessary education and time, and they cared more for making copiesof the Bible and Lives of the Saints than they did of fairy tales.  Thecommon people, and even kings and queens, were therefore obliged todepend upon the professional story-teller.Fairy tales were very popular in the Middle Ages.  In the long wintermonths fields could not be cultivated, traveling had to be abandoned,and all were kept within doors by the cold and snow.  We know what theknight's house looked like in those days.  The large beamed hail orliving room was the principal room.  At one end of it, on a lowplatform, was a table for the knight, his family, and any visitingknights and ladies.  At the other tables on the main floor were thearmed men, like squires and retainers, who helped defend the castlefrom attack, and the maids of the household.The story-teller, who was sometimes called a bard or skald or minstrel,had his place of honor in the center of the room, and when the meal wasover he was called upon for a story.  These story-tellers became veryexpert in the practice of their art, and some of them could arousetheir audiences to a great pitch of excitement.  In the note thatprecedes the story "The Treason of Ganelon," in the volume "Heroes andHeroines of Chivalry," you can see how one of these story-tellers, orminstrels, sang aloud a story to the soldiers of William the Conquerorto encourage them as he led them into battle.The fairy tales collected by the Brothers Grimm were first published in1812.  They spent thirteen years collecting them, writing them down asthey were told by the peasants in Hesse, a mountainous province ofGermany lying far removed from the great main roads.Their friends helped them, but their best friend was the wife of acowherd, a strong, intelligent woman of fifty, who had a perfect geniusfor storytelling.  She knew she told the stories well, and that notmany had her gift.  The Grimms said that though she repeated a storyfor them three times, the variations were so slight as to be hardlyapparent.The American Indian stories of Manabozho the Mischief-Maker and hisadventures with the Wolf and the Woodpeckers and the Ducks werecollected in very much the same way by Henry R. Schoolcraft (1793-1864), the explorer and traveler, who lived among the Indian tribes forthirty years.Mrs. Steel has told us how she collected her Hindu stories, oftenlistening over and over to poor story-tellers who would spoil a storyin trying to tell it, until one day her patience would be rewarded byhearing it from the lips of the best storyteller in the village, whowas generally a boy.As all nations have their fairy tales, you will find in this collectionexamples of English, Irish, French, German, Scandinavian, Icelandic,Russian, Polish, Serbian, Spanish, Arabian, Hindu, Chinese, andJapanese fairy tales, as well as those recited around the lodge firesat night by American Indians for the entertainment of the red childrenof the West.I hope the work may prove for many a boy and girl (of any age up to ahundred) the Golden Bridge over which they can plunge into thatmarvelous world of fairies, elves, goblins, kobolds, trolls, afreets,jinns, ogres, and giants that fascinates us all, lost to this worldtill some one wakes us up to say "Bedtime!"Such excursions fill the mind with beautiful fancies and help todevelop that most precious of our faculties, the imagination.WILLIAM PATTEN.MANABOZHO, THE MISCHIEF-MAKERAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftTHERE was never in the whole world a more mischievous busybody thanthat notorious giant Manabozho.  He was everywhere, in season and outof season, running about, and putting his hand in whatever was goingforward.To carry on his game he could take almost any shape he pleased.  Hecould be very foolish or very wise, very weak or very strong, very richor very poor-just as happened to suit his humor best.  Whatever anyoneelse could do, he would attempt without a moment's reflection.  He wasa match for any man he met, and there were few manitoes*  (*goodspirits or evil spirits) that could get the better of him.  By turns hewould be very kind or very cruel, an animal or a bird, a man or aspirit, and yet, in spite of all these gifts, Manabozho was alwaysgetting himself involved in all sorts of troubles.  More than once, inthe course of his adventures, was this great maker of mischief drivento his wits' ends to come off with his life.To begin at the beginning, Manabozho, while yet a youngster, was livingwith his grandmother near the edge of a great prairie.  It was on thisprairie that he first saw animals and birds of every kind; he alsothere made first acquaintance with thunder and lightning.  He would sitby the hour watching the clouds as they rolled by, musing on the shadesof light and darkness as the day rose and fell.For a stripling, Manabozho was uncommonly wide-awake.  Every sight hebeheld in the heavens was a subject of remark, every new animal or birdan object of deep interest, and every sound was like a new lesson whichhe was expected to learn.  He often trembled at what he heard and saw.The first sound he heard was that of the owl, at which he was greatlyterrified, and, quickly descending the tree he had climbed, he ran withalarm to the lodge.  "Noko! noko! grandmother!" he cried.  "I haveheard a monedo."She laughed at his fears, and asked him what kind of a noise it made.He answered.  "It makes a noise like this: ko-ko-ko-ho!"His grandmother told him he was young and foolish; that what he heardwas only a bird which derived its name from the peculiar noise it made.He returned to the prairie and continued his watch.  As he stood therelooking at the clouds he thought to himself, "It is singular that I amso simple and my grandmother so wise; and that I have neither fathernor mother.  I have never heard a word about them.  I must ask and findout."He went home and sat down, silent and dejected.  Finding that this didnot attract the notice of his grandmother, he began a loud lamentation,which he kept increasing, louder and louder, till it shook the lodgeand nearly deafened the old grandmother."Manabozho, what is the matter with you?" she said, "you are making agreat deal of noise."Manabozho started off again with his doleful hubbub, but succeeded injerking out between his big sobs, "I haven't got any father nor mother,I haven't."Knowing that he was of a wicked and revengeful nature, his grandmotherdreaded to tell him the story of his parentage, as she knew he wouldmake trouble of it.Manabozho renewed his cries and managed to throw out for a third orfourth time, his sorrowful lament that he was a poor unfortunate whohad no parents or relatives.At last she said to him, to quiet him, "Yes, you have a father andthree brothers living.  Your mother is dead.  She was taken for a wifeby your father, the West, without the consent of her parents.  Yourbrothers are the North, East, and South; and being older than you yourfather has given them great power with the winds, according to theirnames.  You are the youngest of his children.  I have nursed you fromyour infancy, for your mother died when you were born.""I am glad my father is living," said Manabozho, "I shall set out inthe morning to visit him."His grandmother would have discouraged him, saying it was a longdistance to the place where his father, Ningabinn, or the West, lived.This information seemed rather to please than to discourage Manabozho,for by this time he had grown to such a size and strength that he hadbeen compelled to leave the narrow shelter of his grandmother's lodgeand live out of doors.  He was so tall that, if he had been sodisposed, he could have snapped off the heads of the birds roosting onthe topmost branches of the highest trees, as he stood up, withoutbeing at the trouble to climb.  And if he had at any time taken a fancyto one of the same trees for a walking stick, he would have had no moreto do than to pluck it up with his thumb and finger and strip down theleaves and twigs with the palm of his hand.Bidding good-by to his old grandmother, who pulled a very long faceover his departure, Manabozho set out at a great pace, for he was ableto stride from one side of a prairie to the other at a single step.He found his father on a high mountain far in the west.  His fatherespied his approach at a great distance, and bounded down themountainside several miles to give him welcome.  Apparently delightedwith each other, they reached in two or three of their giant paces thelodge of the West which stood high up near the clouds.They spent some days in talking with each other-for these two greatpersons did nothing on a small scale, and a whole day to deliver asingle sentence, such was the immensity of their discourse, was quitean ordinary affair.One evening Manabozho asked his father what he was most afraid of onearth.He replied-"Nothing.""But is there nothing you dread here-nothing that would hurt you if youtook too much of it?  Come, tell me."Manabozho was very urgent, so at last his father said: "Yes, there is ablack stone to be found a couple of hundred miles from here, over thatway," pointing as he spoke.  "It is the only thing on earth I am afraidof, for if it should happen to hit me on any part of my body it wouldhurt me very much."  The West made this important circumstance known toManabozho in the strictest confidence."Now you will not tell anyone, Manabozho, that the black stone is badmedicine for your father, will you?"  he added.  "You are a good son,and I know you will keep it to yourself.  Now tell me, my darling boy,is there not something that you don't like?"Manabozho answered promptly-"Nothing."His father, who was of a steady and persevering nature, put the samequestion to him seventeen times, and each time Manabozho made the sameanswer-' 'Nothing."But the West insisted-"There must be something you are afraid of.""Well, I will tell you," said Manabozho, "what it is."He made an effort to speak, but it seemed to be too much for him."Out with it," said the West, fetching Manabozho such a blow on theback as shook the mountain with its echo."Je-ee, je-ee-it is," said Manabozho, apparently in great pain.  "Yes,yes!  I cannot name it, I tremble so."The West told him to banish his fears, and to speak up; no one wouldhurt him.  Manabozho began again, and he would have gone over the samemake-believe of pain, had not his father, whose strength he knew wasmore than a match for his own, threatened to pitch him into a riverabout five miles off.  At last he cried out:"Father, since you will know, it is the root of the bulrush."  He whocould with perfect ease spin a sentence a whole day long, seemed to beexhausted by the effort of pronouncing that one word, "bulrush."Some time after Manabozho observed: "I will get some of the black rock,merely to see how it looks.""Well," said the father, "I will also get a little of the bulrush root,to learn how it tastes."They were both double-dealing with each other, and in their heartsgetting ready for some desperate work.  They had no sooner separatedfor the evening than Manabozho was striding off the couple of hundredmiles necessary to bring him to the place where the black rock was tobe procured, while down the other side of the mountain hurriedNingabinn, the West.At the break of day they each appeared at the great level on themountain-top, Manabozho with twenty loads, at least, of the blackstone, on one side, and on the other the West, with a whole meadow ofbulrush in his arms.Manabozho was the first to strike-hurling a great piece of the blackrock, which struck the West directly between the eyes, and he returnedthe favor with a blow of bulrush that rung over the shoulders ofManabozho, far and wide, like the long lash of the lightning among theclouds.First one and then the other, Manabozho poured in a tempest of blackrock, while the West discharged a shower of bulrush.  Blow upon blow,thwack upon thwack-they fought hand to hand until black rock andbulrush were all gone.  Then they betook themselves to hurling crags ateach other, cudgeling with huge oak trees, and defying each other fromone mountain top to another; while at times they shot enormous bouldersof granite across at each other's heads, as though they had been merejackstones.  The battle, which had commenced on the mountains, hadextended far west.  The West was forced to give ground.  Manabozhopressing on, drove him across rivers and mountains, ridges and lakes,till at last he got him to the very brink of the world."Hold!" cried the West.  "My son, you know my power, and although Iallow I am now fairly out of breath, it is impossible to kill me.  Stopwhere you are, and I will also portion you out with as much power asyour brothers.  The four quarters of the globe are already occupied,but you can go and do a great deal of good to the people of the earth,which is beset with serpents, beasts and monsters, who make great havocof human life.  Go and do good, and if you put forth half the strengthyou have to-day, you will acquire a name that will last forever.  Whenyou have finished your work I will have a place provided for you.  Youwill then go and sit with your brother, Kabinocca, in the north."Manabozho gave his father his hand upon this agreement.  And partingfrom.  him, he returned to his own grounds, where he lay for some timesore of his wounds.WHY THE WOODPECKER HAS RED HEAD FEATHERSAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftWHEN his wounds had all been cured by his grandmother's skill inmedicine, Manabozho, as big and sturdy as ever, was ripe for newadventures.  He set his thoughts immediately upon a war excursionagainst the Pearl Feather, a wicked old manito, living on the otherside of the great lake, who had killed his grandfather.He began his preparations by making huge bows and arrows withoutnumber, but he had no arrow heads.  At last his grandmother, Noko, toldhim that an old man who lived at some distance could furnish him withsome, and he sent her to get them.  Though she returned with herwrapper full, he told her that he had not enough and sent her again formore.In the meanwhile he thought to himself, "I must find out the way ofmaking these heads."Instead of directly asking how it was done, he preferred-just likeManabozho-to deceive his grandmother, in order to learn what he wantedby a trick.  "Noko," said he, "while I take my drum and rattle, andsing my war songs, do you go and try to get me some larger heads, forthese you have brought me are all of the same size.  Go and see whetherthe old man is not willing to make some a little larger."He followed her at a distance as she went, having left his drum at thelodge, with a great bird tied at the top, whose fluttering wings shouldkeep up the drumbeat, the same as if he were standing there beating thedrum himself.  He saw the old workman busy, and learned how he preparedthe heads; he also beheld the old man's daughter, who was verybeautiful.  Manabozho discovered for the first time that he had a heartof his own, and the sigh he heaved passed through the arrow maker'slodge like a young gale of wind."My how it blows!" said the old man."It must be from the south, though," said the daughter, "it is sofragrant."Manabozho slipped away, and in two strides he was at home, shoutingforth his songs as though he had never left the lodge.  He had justtime to untie the bird which had been beating the drum when hisgrandmother came in and gave him the big arrowheads.In the evening the grandmother said, "My son, you ought to fast beforeyou go to war, as your brothers do, to find out whether you will besuccessful or not."He said he had no objection.  Having privately stored away in a shadyplace in the forest two or three dozen juicy bears, a moose, and twentystrings of the tenderest birds, he would retire from the lodge so faras to be entirely out of view of his grandmother and fall to and enjoyhimself heartily.  At nightfall, having dispatched a dozen birds andhalf a bear or so, he would return, tottering and forlorn, as if quitefamished, so as to make his grandmother feel sorry for him.When he had finished his term of fasting, in the course of which heslyly dispatched twenty fat bears, six dozen birds, and two fine moose,Manabozho sung his war song and embarked in his canoe, fully preparedfor war.Besides his weapons he took along a large supply of oil.He traveled rapidly night and day, for he had only to will or speak,and the canoe went.  At length he arrived in sight of the fieryserpents, and stopped to study them.  He noticed that they were ofenormous length and of a bright color, that they were some distanceapart, and that the flames which poured forth from the mouths reachedacross the pass, so he said good morning and began talking with them ina very friendly way.  They were not to be deceived, however."We know you, Manabozho," they said, "you cannot pass."Turning his canoe as if about to go back, he suddenly cried out with aloud and terrified voice:  "WHAT IS THAT BEHIND YOU?"The serpents thrown off their guard, instantly turned their heads, andin a moment Manabozho glided silently past them."Well," said he, softly, after he had got by, "how about it?"He then took up his bow and arrows, and with deliberate aim shot everyone of them easily, for the serpents were fixed to one spot and couldnot even turn around.Having thus escaped the sentinel serpents, Manabozho pushed on in hiscanoe until he came to a part of the lake called Pitch-Water, aswhatever touched it was sure to stick fast.But Manabozho was prepared with his oil and, rubbing his canoe freelywith it, from end to end, he slipped through with ease-and he was thefirst person who had ever succeeded in passing through the Pitch-Water."Nothing like a little oil," said Manabozho to himself.Having by this time come in view of land, he could see the lodge of theShining Manito, high upon a distant hill.  At the dawn of day he puthis clubs and arrows in order and began his attack, yelling andshouting and beating his drum, and calling out so as to make it appearthat he had many followers:"Surround him! surround him! run up! run up!"He stalked bravely forward, shouting aloud, "It was you that killed mygrandfather," and shot off a whole forest of arrows.The Pearl Feather appeared on the height, blazing like the sun, andpaid back Manabozho with a tempest of bolts which rattled like hail.All day long the fight was kept up, and Manabozho had fired all of hisarrows but three without effect, for the Shining Manito was clothed inpure wampum.  It was only by immense leaps to right and left thatManabozho could save his head from the sturdy blows which fell abouthim on every side, like pine.trees, from the hands of the Manito.  Hewas badly bruised, and at his very wits' end, when a large Woodpeckerflew past and lit on a tree.  It was a bird he had known on theprairie, near his grandmother's lodge."Manabozho," called out the Woodpecker, "your enemy has a weak point;shoot at the lock of hair on the crown of his head."The first arrow he shot only drew a few drops of blood.  The Manitomade one or two unsteady steps, but recovered himself.  He began toparley, but Manabozho, now that he had discovered a way to reach him,was in no humor to trifle, and he let slip another arrow which broughtthe Shining Manito to his knees.  Having the crown of his head withingood range Manabozho shot his third arrow, and the Manito fell forwardupon the ground, dead.Manabozho called the Woodpecker to come and receive a reward for thetimely hint he had given him, and he rubbed the blood of the ShiningManito on the Woodpecker's head, the feathers of which are red to thisday.Full of his victory, Manabozho returned home, beating his war drumfuriously and shouting aloud his song of triumph.  His grandmother wason the shore to welcome him with the war dance, which she performedwith wonderful skill for one so far advanced in years.WHY THE DIVER DUCK HAS SO FEW TAIL FEATHERSAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftHAVING overcome the powerful Pearl Feather, killed his serpents andescaped all is wiles and charms, the heart of Manabozho welled withinhim.  An unconquerable desire for further adventures seized upon him.He had won in a great fight on land, so he determined -his next successshould come to him from the water.He tried his luck as a fisherman and with such success that he capturedan enormous fish, a fish so -rich in fat that with the oil Manabozhowas able to -form a small lake.  Wishing to be generous, and at thesame time having a cunning plan of his own, he invited all the birdsand beasts of his acquaintance to come and feast upon the oil, tellingthem that the order in which they partook of the banquet -would decidehow fat each was to be for all time to -come.As fast as they arrived he told them to plunge in and help themselves.The first to make his appearance was the bear, -who took a long andsteady draft; then came the deer, the opossum, and such others of thefamily as are noted for their comfortable covering.  The moose and thebuffalo were late in arriving on the scene, and the partridge, alwayslean in flesh, looked on till the supply was nearly gone.  There wasnot -a drop left by the time the hare and the marten appeared on theshore of the lake, and they are, in consequence, the slenderest of allcreatures.When this ceremony was over Manabozho suggested to his friends, theassembled birds and animals, that the occasion was proper for a littlemerrymaking; and taking up his drum he cried out:"New songs from the South! Come, brothers, dance!"They all fell in and commenced their rounds.  Whenever Manabozho, as hestood in the circle, saw a fat fowl which he fancied pass him, headroitly wrung its neck and slipped it under his belt, at the same timebeating his drum and singing at the top of his lungs to drown the noiseof the fluttering, crying out in a tone of admiration:"That's the way, my brothers; that's the way."  At last a small duck ofthe diver family, thinking there was something wrong, opened one eyeand saw what Manabozho was doing.  Giving a spring, and crying: "Ha-ha-a! Manabozho is killing us!" he made a dash for the water.Manabozho was so angry that the creature should have played the spythat he gave chase, and just as the Diver Duck was getting into thewater he gave him a kick, which is the reason that the diver's tailfeathers are few, his back flattened, and his legs straightened out, sothat when he is seen walking on land he makes a sorry looking figure.The other birds, having no ambition to be thrust in Manabozho's belt,flew off, and the animals scampered into the woods.MANAIBOZHO IS CHANGED INTO AWOLFAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftONE evening, as Manabozho was walking along the shore of a great lake,weary and hungry, he met a great magician in the form of an Old Wolf,with six young ones, coming toward him.The Wolf no Sooner caught sight of him than he told his whelps, whowere close beside him, to keep out of the way of Manabozho, "For Iknow," he said, "that it is that mischievous fellow whom we seeyonder."The young wolves were in the act of running off when Manabozho criedout, "My grandchildren, where are you going?  Stop and I will go withyou.  I wish to have a little chat with your excellent father."Saying which, he advanced and greeted the Old Wolf, expressing himselfas delighted at seeing him looking so well.  "Whither do you journey?"he asked."We are looking for a good hunting-ground to pass the winter," the OldWolf answered.  "What brings you here?"'I was looking for you," said Manabozho.  "For I have a passion for thechase, brother.  I always admired your family; are you willing tochange me into a wolf?"The Wolf gave him a favorable answer, and he was forthwith changed intoa wolf."Well, that will do," said Manabozho.  "But," he said, looking at histail, "could you oblige me by making my tail a little longer and morebushy, just a little more bushy?""Certainly," said the Old Wolf; and he straightway gave Manabozho sucha length and spread of tail that it was continually getting between hislegs, and it was so heavy that it was as much as he could do to carryit.  But, having asked for it, he was ashamed to say a word, and theyall started off in company, dashing up the ravine.After getting into the woods for some distance they ran across thetracks of moose.  The young ones scampered off in pursuit, the Old Wolfand Manabozho following at their leisure."Well," said the Old Wolf, by way of starting the conversation, "who doyou think is the fastest of the boys?  Can you tell by the jumps theytake?""Why," he replied, "that one that takes such 'long jumps, he is surelythe fastest.""Ha! ha! you are mistaken," said the Old Wolf.  "He makes a good start,but he will be the first to tire out; this one who appears to be behindwill be the one to kill the game."By this time they had come to the spot where the boys had started inchase.  One had dropped what seemed to be a small medicine-sack, whichhe carried for the use of the hunting party."Take that, Manabozho," said the Old Wolf."Why, what will I do with a dirty dog skin?"The Old Wolf took it up; it was a beautiful robe."Oh, I will carry it now," cried Manabozho."Oh, no," said the Wolf, who had used his magical powers, "it is a robeof pearls.  Come along!" And away he sped at a great rate of speed."Not so fast," called Manabozho after him; and then he added to himselfas he panted after, "Oh, this tail!"Coming to a place where the moose had lain down, they saw that theyoung wolves had made a fresh start after their prey.  "'Why," said theOld Wolf, "this moose is thin.  I know by the tracks.  I can alwaystell whether they are fat or not."  A little farther on, one of theyoung wolves, in dashing at the moose, had broken a tooth on a tree."Manabozho," said the Old Wolf, "one of your grandchildren has shot atthe game.  Take his arrow; there it is.""No," replied Manabozho, "what will I do with a dirty dog's tooth?"The Old Wolf took it up, and behold it was a beautiful silver arrow.When they at last overtook them, they found that the youngsters hadkilled a very fat moose.  Manabozho was very hungry, but the Old Wolfjust then again exerted his magical powers, and Manabozho saw nothingbut the bones picked quite clean.  He thought to himself, "Just as Iexpected; dirty, greedy fellows.  If it had not been for this log at myback I should have been in time to have got a mouthful"; and he cursedthe bushy tail which he carried to the bottom of his heart.The Old Wolf finally called out to one of the young ones, "Give somemeat to your grandfather."One of them obeyed, and coming near to Manabozho he presented him theend of his own bushy tail, which was now nicely seasoned with bursgathered in the course of the hunt.  Manabozho jumped up and calledout: "You dog, do you think I am going to eat you?" And he walked offin anger."Come back brother," cried the Wolf.  "You are losing your eyes.  Youdo the child injustice.  Look there I" and behold a heap of fresh meatwas lying on the spot, all prepared.Manabozho turned back, and at the sight of so much good food put on asmiling face.  "Wonderful!" he said, "how fine the meat is !""Yes," replied the Old Wolf, "it is always so with us; we know our workand always get the best.  It is not a long tail that makes the hunter."Manabozho bit his lip.MANABOZHO IS ROBBED BY THE WOLVESAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftSHORTLY after this the Old Wolf suggested to Manabozho that he shouldgo out and try his luck in hunting by himself.  When he chose to puthis mind to it he was quite expert, and this time he succeeded inkilling a fine fat moose which he thought he would take aside slyly anddevour alone.He was very hungry and he sat down to eat, but as he never could go towork in a straightforward way, he immediately fell into great doubts asto the proper point at which to begin."Well," said he, "I do not know where to commence.  At the head?  No,people will laugh, and say, 'He ate him backward.'"He went to the side.  "No," said he, "they will say I ate himsideways."He then went to the hind quarter.  "No, that will not do, either; theywill say I ate him forward.  I will begin here, say what they will."He took a delicate piece from the small of the back, and was just onthe point of putting it to his mouth when a tree close by made acreaking noise.  He seemed vexed at the sound.  He raised the morsel tohis mouth the second time, when the tree creaked again."Why," he exclaimed, "I cannot eat when I hear such a noise. "Stop,stop! " he cried to the tree.  He put down the morsel of meat,exclaiming.  "I CANNOT eat with such a noise," and starting away heclimbed the tree and was actually pulling at the limb which hadbothered him, when his forepaw was caught between the branches so thathe could not free himself.While thus held fast he saw a pack of wolves advancing through the woodin the direction of his meat.  He suspected them to be the Old Wolf andhis cubs, but night was coming on and he could not make them out.  "Gothe other way, go the other Way!" he cried out; "what do you expect toget here?"The Wolves stopped for a while and talked among themselves, and said:"Manabozho must have something there, or he would not tell us to goanother way. ""I begin to know know him," said the Old Wolf, "and all his tricks.Let us go forward and see." They came on and, finding the moose soonmade away with it.Manabozho looked wistfully on while they ate until they were fullysatisfied, when off they scampered in high spirits.  A heavy blast ofwind opened the branches finally, and released him.  The wolves hadleft nothing but bare bones.  He made for home.When he related his mishap, the Old Wolf, taking him by the forepaw,condoled with him deeply on his ill luck.  A tear even started to hiseye as he added: "My brother, this should teach us not to meddle withpoints of ceremony when we have good meat to eat."MANABOZHO AND THE WOODPECKERSAdapted from H. R. SchoolcraftMANABOZHO lost the greater part of his magical power through lettinghis young wolf grandson fall through the thin ice and drown.  No oneknew where his grandmother had gone to.  He married the arrow maker'sdaughter, and became the father of several children, but he was verypoor and scarcely able to procure a living.  His lodge was pitched in adistant part of the country, where he could get no game, and it waswinter time.  One day he said to his wife, "I will go out walking andsee if I can find some lodges."After walking some time he finally discovered a lodge at a distance.There were children playing at the door, and when they saw himapproaching they ran in and told their parents Manabozho was coming.It was the home of the large Red-Headed Woodpecker.  He came to thedoor and asked Manabozho to enter, and the invitation was promptlyaccepted.  After some time the Woodpecker, who was a magician, said tohis wife: "Have you nothing to give Manabozho?  he must be hungry."She answered, "No.""He ought not to go without his supper," said the Woodpecker.  "I willsee what I can do."In the center of the lodge stood a large tamarack tree.  Upon this theWoodpecker flew, and commenced going up, turning his head on each sideof the tree, and every now and then driving in his bill.  At last hepulled something out of the tree and threw it down, when, behold, afine fat raccoon lay on the ground.  He drew out six or seven more, andthen came down and told his wife to prepare them."Manabozho," he said, "this is the only thing we eat; what else can wegive you?""It is very good," replied Manabozho.They smoked their pipes and conversed, and after a while Manabozho gotready to go home, so the Woodpecker said to his wife, "Give him theOther raccoons to take home for his children."In the act of leaving the lodge Manabozho on purpose dropped one of hismittens, which was soon after observed upon the ground.  "Run," saidthe Woodpecker to his eldest son, "and give it to him; but mind thatyou do not give it into his hand; throw it at him, for there is noknowing what he may do, he acts so curiously."The boy did as he was directed.  "Grandfather," he said, as he came upto him, "you have left one of your mittens, and here it is.""Yes," he said, making believe he did not know he had dropped it, "so Idid; but don't throw it, you will get it wet on the snow."The lad, however, threw it, and was about to return when Manabozhocried out, "Bakah! Bakah! Stop, stop; is that all you eat?  Do you eatnothing else with your raccoon?  Tell me!""Yes, that is all, answered the Young Woodpecker; "we have nothingelse.""Tell your father," continued Manabozho, "to come and visit me, and lethim bring a sack.  I will give him what he shall eat with his raccoonmeat."When the young one returned and reported this message to his father theOld Woodpecker turned up his nose at the invitation.  "I wonder," hesaid "what he thinks he has got, poor fellow!" He was bound, however,to answer the offer of hospitality, and he went accordingly, takingalong a cedar-sack, to pay a visit to Manabozho.Manabozho received the Old Red-Headed Woodpecker with great ceremony.He had stood at the door awaiting his arrival, and as soon as he camein sight Manabozho commenced, while he was yet far off, bowing andopening wide his arms, in token of welcome; all of which the Woodpeckerreturned in due form, by ducking his bill and hopping to right andleft, extending his wings to their full length and fluttering them backto his breast.When the Woodpecker at last reached the lodge Manabozho made severalremarks upon the weather, the appearance of the country, and especiallyspoke of the scarcity of game.  "But we," he added-"we always haveenough.  Come in, and you shall not go away hungry, my noble birds!"Manabozho had always prided himself on being able to give as good as hehad received; and to be up with the Woodpecker he had shifted his lodgeso as to inclose a large dry tamarack tree."What can I give you?" said he to the Woodpecker; "as we eat so shallyou eat."With this he hopped forward and, jumping on the tamarack tree, heattempted to climb it just as he had seen the Woodpecker do in his ownlodge.  He turned his head first on one side and then on the other, asthe Woodpecker does, striving to go up the tree, but as often slippingdown.  Every now and then he would strike the tree with his nose, as ifit was a bell, and draw back as if to pull something out of the tree,but he pulled out no raccoons.  He dashed his nose so often against thetrunk that at last the blood began to flow, and he tumbled downsenseless on the ground.The Woodpecker started up with his drum and rattle to restore him, andby beating them violently he succeeded in bringing him to.As soon as he came to his senses, Manabozho began to lay the blame ofhis failure upon his wife, saying to his guest: "Nemesho, it is thiswoman relation of yours-she is the cause of my not succeeding.  She hasmade me a worthless fellow.  Before I married her I also could getraccoons.The Woodpecker said nothing, but flying on the tree he drew out severalfine raccoons.  "Here," said he, "this is the way we do" and left himin disdain, carrying his bill high in the air, and stepping over thedoorsill as if it were not worthy to be touched by his toes.THE BOY AND THE WOLVESRetold by Andrew LangONCE upon a time an Indian hunter built himself a house in the middleof a great forest, far away from all his tribe; for his heart wasgentle and kind and he was weary of the treachery and cruel deeds ofthose who had been his friends.  So he left them and took his wife andthree children, and they journeyed on until they found a spot near to aclear stream, where they began to cut down trees and to make readytheir wigwam.  For many years they lived peacefully and happily in thissheltered place, never leaving it except to hunt the wild animals,which served them both for food and clothes.  At last, however, thestrong man fell sick, and before long lie knew he must die.  So hegathered his family round him and said his last words to them."You, my wife, the companion of my days, will follow me ere many moonshave waned to the island of the blessed.  But for you, 0 my children,whose lives are but newly begun, the wickedness, unkindness, andingratitude from which I fled are before you.  Yet I shall go hence inpeace, my children, if you will promise always to love each other andnever to forsake your youngest brother.""Never!" they replied, holding out their hands.  And the hunter diedcontent.Scarcely eight moons had passed when, just as he had said, the wifewent forth and followed her husband; but before leaving her childrenshe bade the two elder ones think of their promise never to forsake theyounger, for he was a child and weak.  And while the snow lay thickupon the ground they tended him and cherished him; but when the earthshowed green again the heart of the young man stirred within him, andhe longed to see the wigwams of the village where his father's youthwas spent.Therefore he opened all his heart to his sister, who answered: "Mybrother, I understand your longing for our fellow-men, whom here wecannot see.  But remember our father's words.  Shall we not seek ourown pleasures and forget the little one?"But he would not listen, and, making no reply, he took his bow andarrows and left the hut.  The snows fell and melted, yet he neverreturned, and at last the heart of the girl grew cold and hard and herlittle boy became a burden in her eyes, till one day she spoke thus tohim: "See, there is food for many days to come.  Stay here within theshelter of the hut.  I go to seek our brother, and when I have foundhim I shall return hither."But when, after hard journeying, she reached the village where herbrother dwelt and saw that he had a wife and was happy, and when she,too, was sought by a young brave, then she also forgot the boy alone inthe forest and thought only of her husband.Now as soon as the little boy had eaten all the food which his sisterhad left him, he went out into the woods and gathered berries and dugup roots, and while the sun shone he was contented and had his fill.But when the snows began and the wind howled, then his stomach feltempty and his limbs cold, and he hid in trees all the night and onlycrept out to eat what the wolves had left behind.  And by and by,having no other friends, he sought their company, and sat by while theydevoured their prey, and they grew to know him and gave him food.  Andwithout them he would have died in the snow.  But at last the snowsmelted and the ice upon the great lake, and as the wolves went down tothe shore the boy went after them.  And it happened one day that hisbig brother was fishing in his canoe near the shore, and he heard thevoice of a child singing in the Indian tone:	"My brother, my brother!	I am becoming a wolf,	I am becoming a wolf!"And when he had so sung he howled as wolves howl.  Then the heart ofthe elder sank and he hastened toward him, crying: "Brother, littlebrother, come to me;" but he, being half a wolf, only continued hissong.  And the louder the elder called him, "Brother, little brother,come to me," the swifter he fled after his brothers the wolves and theheavier grew his skin, till, with a long howl, he vanished into thedepths of the forest.So, with shame and anguish in his soul, the elder brother went back tohis village, and with his sister mourned the little boy and the brokenpromise till the end of his life.THE INDIAN WHO LOST HIS WIFERetold by Andrew LangONCE upon a time there was a man and his wife who lived in the forestfar from the rest of the tribe.  Very often they spent the day inhunting together, but after awhile the wife found that she had so manythings to do that she was obliged to stay at home; so he went alone,though he found that when his wife was not with him he never had anyluck.  One day, when he was away hunting, the woman fell ill, and in afew days she died.  Her husband grieved bitterly and buried her in thehouse where she had passed her life; but as the time went on he felt solonely without her that he made a wooden doll about her height amidsize for company and dressed it in her clothes.  He seated it in frontof the fire and tried to think he had his wife back again.  The nextday he went out to hunt, and when he came home the first thing he didwas to go up to the doll and brush off some of the ashes from the firewhich had fallen on its face.  But he was very busy now, for he had tocook and mend, besides getting food, for there was no one to help him.And so a whole year passed away.At the end of that time he came back from hunting one night and foundsome wood by the door and a fire within.  The next night there was notonly wood and fire, but a piece of meat in the kettle, nearly ready foreating.  He searched all about to see who could have done this, butcould find no one.  The next time he went to hunt he took care not togo far and came in quite early.  And while he was still a long way offhe saw a woman going into the house with wood on her shoulders.  So hemade haste and opened the door quickly, and instead of the wooden dollhis wife sat in front of the fire.  Then she spoke to him and said:"The Great Spirit felt sorry for you because you would not becomforted, so he let me come back to you, but you must not stretch outyour hand to touch me till we have seen the rest of our people.  If youdo I shall die."So the man listened to her words, and the woman dwelt there and broughtthe wood and kindled the fire, till one day her husband said to her:"It is now two years since you died.  Let us now go back to our tribe.Then you will be well and I can touch you."And with that he prepared food for the journey, a string of deer'sflesh for her to carry and one for himself; and so they started.  Now,the camp of the tribe was distant six days' journey, and when they wereyet one day's journey off it began to snow, and they felt weary andlonged for rest.  Therefore they made a fire, cooked some food, andspread out their skins to sleep.Then the heart of the man was greatly stirred and he stretched out hisarms to his wife, but she waved her hands and said:"We have seen no one yet.  It is too soon."But he would not listen to her and caught her to him, and behold! hewas clasping the wooden doll.  And when he saw it was the doll hepushed it from him in his misery and rushed away to the camp and toldthem all his story.  And some doubted, and they went back with him tothe place where he and his wife had stopped to rest, and there lay thedoll, and besides, they saw in time snow the steps of two people, andthe foot of one was like the foot of the doll.  And the man grievedsore all the days of his life.PUNCHKINBy E. FrereONCE upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was moreclever than the rest.  The Raja's wife died when they were quite littlechildren, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother totake care of them.The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinnerevery day, while he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on theaffairs of the nation.About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; andevery day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their father'sdinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg for alittle fire from the hearth.  Then Balna used to say to her sisters,"Send that woman away; send her away.  Let her get the fire at her ownhouse.  What does she want with ours?  If we allow her to come here, weshall suffer for it some day."But the other sisters would answer, "Be quiet, Balna; why must youalways be quarreling with this poor woman?  Let her take some fire ifshe likes."  Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and takea few sticks from it; and while no one was looking, she would quicklythrow some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being preparedfor the Raja's dinner.Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters.  Ever since their mother'sdeath they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order toavoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies.  So, when hefound the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise fromtheir carelessness, as it did not seem likely that anyone should haveput mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like toreprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeatedmany days.At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughterscooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room,and watched them through a hole in the wall.There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice andpreparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by thefire ready to be cooked.  Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come tothe door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinnerwith.  Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, "Why don't you keep fuelin your own house, and not come here every day and take ours?  Sisters,don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself."Then the eldest sister answered, "Balna, let the poor woman take thewood and the fire; she does us no harm."  But Balna replied, "If youlet her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make ussorry for it, some day."The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all hisdinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw alittle mud into each of the dishes.At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized andbrought before him.  But when the widow came, she told him that she hadplayed this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; andshe spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words,that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her hisRanee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace.Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to getthem, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter mighthave all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in theirplace; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her,she did all she could to make them miserable.  She gave them nothingbut bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water todrink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomedto have everything comfortable about them, and good food and goodclothes all their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and theyused to go out every day and sit by their dead mother's tomb and cry-and say:"O mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy weare, and how we are starved by our cruel stepmother?"One day, while they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! abeautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh,ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating someof the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat thebad dinner their stepmother provided for them, they used to go out totheir mother's grave and eat the pommels which grew there on thebeautiful tree.Then the Ranee said to her daughter, "I cannot tell how it is, everyday those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eatany; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better thanyou do.  I cannot tell how it is."   And she bade her watch the sevenPrincesses, and see if anyone gave them anything to eat.So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and wereeating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them,and saw them gathering the fruit.Then Balna said to her sisters, "Do you not see that girl watching us?Let us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tellher mother all about it, and that will be bad for us."But the other sisters said, "Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna.  The girlwould never be so cruel as to tell her mother.  Let us rather inviteher to come and have some of the fruit."  And calling her to them, theygave her one of the pomeloes.No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan's daughter wenthome and said to her mother, "I do not wonder the seven Princesses willnot eat the dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother's gravethere grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day andeat the pomeloes.  I ate one, and it was the nicest I have evertasted."The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day shestayed in her room, and told the Raja that she had a very bad headache.The Raja was deeply grieved, and said to his wife, "What can I do foryou?"   She answered, "There is only one thing that will make myheadache well.  By your dead wife's tomb there grows a fine pomelotree; you must bring that here, and boil it, root and branch, and put alittle of the water in which it has been boiled on my forehead, andthat will cure my headache."   So the Raja sent his servants, and hadthe beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Raneedesired; and when some of the water, in which it had been boiled, wasput on her forehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quitewell.Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of theirmother, the pomelo tree had disappeared.  Then they all began to cryvery bitterly.Now there was by the Ranee's tomb a small tank, and as they were cryingthey saw the tank was filled with a rich cream-like substance, whichquickly hardened into a thick white cake.  At seeing this all thePrincesses were very glad, and they ate some of the cake, and liked it;and next day the same thing happened, and so it went on for many days.Every morning the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and foundthe little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like cake.  Then thecruel stepmother said to her daughter: "I cannot tell how it is, I havehad the pomelo tree which used to grow by the Ranee's grave destroyed,and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor look more sad, though theynever eat the dinner I give them.  I cannot tell how it is!"And her daughter said, "I will watch."Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who shouldcome by but their stepmother's daughter.  Balna saw her first, andsaid, "See, sisters, there comes that girl again.  Let us sit round theedge of the tank and not allow her to see it, for if we give her someof our cake, she will go and tell her mother; and that will be veryunfortunate for us."The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious, andinstead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan's daughter someof the cake, and she went home and told her mother all about it.The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedinglyangry, and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee's tomb, andfill the little tank with the ruins.  And not content with this, shenext day pretended to be very, very ill-in fact, at the point of death-and when the Raja was much grieved, and asked her whether it was in hispower to procure her any remedy, she said to him: "Only one thing cansave my life, but I know you will not do it."  He replied, "Yes,whatever it is, I will do it."  She then said, "To save my life, youmust kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of theirblood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their death willbe my life."  At these words the Raja was very sorrowful; but becausehe feared to break his word, he went out with a heavy heart to find hisdaughters.He found them crying by the ruins of their mother's grave.Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Raja spoke kindly to them,and told them to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made afire and cooked some rice, and gave it to them.  But in the afternoon,it being very hot, the seven Princesses all fell asleep, and when hesaw they were fast asleep, the Raja, their father, stole away and leftthem (for he feared his wife), saying to himself: "It is better my poordaughters should die here, than be killed by their stepmother."He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some of its blood on theforehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he hadreally killed the Princesses, and said she felt quite well.Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves allalone in the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to callout as loud as they could, in hopes of making their father hear; but hewas by that time far away, and would not have been able to hear themeven had their voices been as loud as thunder.It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a neighboringRaja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as they werereturning home, after the day's sport was over, the youngest Princesaid to his brothers: "Stop, I think I hear some one crying and callingout.  Do you not hear voices?  Let us go in the direction of the sound,and find out what it is."So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the placewhere the seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands.  At thesight of them the young Princes were very much astonished, and stillmore so on learning their story; and they settled that each should takeone of these poor forlorn ladies home with him, and marry her.So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him,and married her.And the second took the second; and third took the third; and thefourth took the fourth; and the fifth took the fifth; and the sixthtook the sixth; and the seventh, and the handsomest of all, took thebeautiful Balna.And when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicingthroughout the kingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes toseven such beautiful Princesses.About a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles andaunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathersand seven mothers.  None of the other Princes and Princesses had anychildren, so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was acknowledgedtheir heir by all the rest.They had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day theseventh Prince (Balna's husband) said he would go out hunting, and awayhe went; and they waited long for him, but he never came back.Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become ofhim; and they went away, but they also did not return.And the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they feared that theirkind husbands must have been killed.One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna was rocking herbaby's cradle, and while her sisters were working in the room below,there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress, who saidthat he was a Fakir, and came to beg.  The servant said to him, "Youcannot go into the palace-the Raja's sons have all gone away; we thinkthey must be dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by yourbegging."  But he said, "I am a holy man, you must let me in.  Then thestupid servants let him walk through the palace, but they did not knowthat this was no Fakir, but a wicked Magician named Punchkin.Punchkin Fakir wandered through the palace, and saw many beautifulthings there, till at last he reached the room where Balna sat singingbeside her little boy's cradle.  The Magician thought her morebeautiful than all the other beautiful things he had seen, insomuchthat he asked her to go home with him and to marry him.  But she said,"My husband, I fear, is dead, but my little boy is still quite young; Iwill stay here and teach him to grow up a clever man, and when he isgrown up he shall go out into the world, and try and learn tidings ofhis father.  Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him, or marry yon."At these words the Magician was very angry, and turned her into alittle black dog, and led her away; saying, "Since yon will not comewith me of your own free will, I will make you."  So the poor Princesswas dragged away, without any power of effecting an escape, or ofletting her sisters know what had become of her.  As Punchkin passedthrough the palace gate the servants said to him, "Where did yon getthat pretty little dog?"  And he answered, "One of the Princesses gaveit to me as a present."  At hearing which they let him go withoutfurther questioning.Soon after this, the six elder Princesses heard the little baby, theirnephew, begin to cry, and when they went upstairs they were muchsurprised to find him all alone, and Balna nowhere to be seen.  Thenthey questioned the servants, and when they heard of the Fakir and thelittle black dog, they guessed what had happened, and sent in everydirection seeking them, but neither the Fakir nor the dog were to befound.  What could six poor women do?  They gave up all hopes of everseeing their kind husbands, and their sister, and her husband again,and devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care oftheir little nephew.Thus time went on, till Balna's son was fourteen years old.  Then, oneday, his aunts told him the history of the family; and no sooner did hehear it, than be was seized with a great desire to go in search of hisfather and mother and uncles, and if he could find them alive to bringthem home again.  His aunts, on learning his determination, were muchalarmed and tried to dissuade him, saying, "We have lost our husbands,and our sister and her husband, and you are now our sole hope; if yougo away, what shall we do?"  But he replied, "I pray you not to bediscouraged; I will return soon, and if it is possible bring my fatherand mother and uncles with me."  So he set out on his travels; but forsome months he could learn nothing to help him in his search.At last, after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles, andbecome almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his parents,he one day came to a country that seemed full of stones, and rocks, andtrees, and there he saw a large palace with a tower; hard by was aMalee's little house.As he was looking about, the Malee's wife saw him, and ran out of thehouse and said, "My dear boy, who are you that dare venture to thisdangerous place?"  He answered, "I am a Raja's son, and I come insearch of my father, and my uncles, and my mother whom a wickedenchanter bewitched."Then the Malee's wife said, "This country and this palace belong to agreat enchanter; he is all powerful, and if anyone displeases him, hecan turn them into stones and trees.  All the rocks and trees you seehere were living people once, and the Magician turned them to what theynow are.  Some time ago a Raja's son came here, and shortly afterwardcame his six brothers, and they were all turned into stones and trees;and these are not the only unfortunate ones, for up in that tower livesa beautiful Princess, whom the Magician has kept prisoner there fortwelve years, because she hates him and will not marry him."Then the little Prince thought, "These must be my parents and myuncles.  I have found what I seek at last."  So he told his story tothe Malee's wife, and begged her to help him to remain in that placeawhile and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she mentioned;and she promised to befriend him, and advised his disguising himselflest the Magician should see him, and turn him likewise into stone.  Tothis the Prince agreed.  So the Malee's wife dressed him up in a saree,and pretended that he was her daughter.One day, not long after this, as the Magician was walking in his gardenhe saw the little girl (as he thought) playing about, and asked her whoshe was.  She told him she was the Malee's daughter, and the Magiciansaid, "You are a pretty little girl, and to-morrow you shall take apresent of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in thetower."The young Prince was much delighted at hearing this, and wentimmediately to inform the Malee's wife; after consultation with whom hedetermined that it would be more safe for him to retain his disguise,and trust to the chance of a favorable opportunity for establishingsome communication with his mother, if it were indeed she.Now it happened that at Balna's marriage her husband had given her asmall gold ring on which her name was engraved, and she had put it onher little son's finger when he was a baby, and afterward when he wasolder his aunts had had it enlarged for him, so that he was still ableto wear it.  The Malee's wife advised him to fasten the well-knowntreasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother, and trustto her recognizing it.  This was not to be done without difficulty, assuch a strict watch was kept over the poor Princess (for fear of herever establishing communication with her friends), that though thesupposed Malee's daughter was permitted to take her flowers every day,the Magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the time.At last one day, however, opportunity favored him, and when no one waslooking the boy tied the ring to a nosegay, and threw it at Balna'sfeet.  It fell with a clang on the floor, and Balna, looking to seewhat made the strange sound, found the little ring tied to the flowers.On recognizing it, she at once believed the story her son told her ofhis long search, and begged him to advise her as to what she had betterdo; at the same time entreating him on no account to endanger his lifeby trying to rescue her.  She told him that for twelve long years theMagician had kept her shut up in the tower because she refused to marryhim, and she was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of release.Now Balna's son was a bright, clever boy, so he said, "Do not fear,dear mother; the first thing to do is to discover how far theMagician's power extends, in order that we may be able to liberate myfather and uncles, whom he has imprisoned in the form of the rocks andtrees.  You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years; nowrather speak kindly.  Tell him you have given up all hopes of againseeing the husband you have so long mourned, and say you are willing toharry him.  Then endeavor to find out what his power consists in, andwhether he is immortal, or can be put to death."Balna determined to take her son's advice; and the next day sent forPunchkin, and spoke to him as had been suggested.The Magician greatly delighted, begged her to allow the wedding to takeplace as soon as possible.But she told him that before she married him he must allow her a littlemore time, in which she might make his acquaintance, and that, afterbeing enemies so long, their friendship could but strengthen bydegrees.  "And do tell me," she said, "are you quite immortal?  Candeath never touch you?  And are you too great an enchanter ever to feelhuman suffering?""Why do you ask?" said he."Because," she replied.  "if I am to be your wife, I would fain knowall about you, in order, if any calamity threatens you, to overcome, orif possible to avert it.""It is true," he added, "that I am not as others.  Far, far away,hundreds of thousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate countrycovered with thick jungle.  In the midst of the jungle grows a circleof palm trees, and in the center of the circle stand six chattees fullof water, piled one above another: below the sixth chattee is a smallcage which contains a little green parrot; on the life of the parrotdepends my life; and if the parrot is killed I must die.  It is.however," he added, "impossible that the parrot should sustain anyinjury, both on account of the inaccessibility of the country, andbecause, by my appointment, many thousand genii surround the palmtrees, and kill all who approach the place."Balna told her son what Punchkin had said; but at the same timeimplored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot.The Prince, however, replied, "Mother, unless I can get hold of thatparrot, you, and my father, and uncles, cannot be liberated: be notafraid, I will shortly return.  Do you, meantime, keep the Magician ingood humor-still putting off your marriage with him on variouspretexts; and before he finds out the cause of delay, I will be here."So saying, he went away.Many, many weary miles did he travel, till at last he came to a thickjungle; and, being very tired, sat down under a tree and fell asleep.He was awakened by a soft rustling sound, and looking about him, saw alarge serpent which was making its way to an eagle's nest built in thetree under which he lay, and in the nest were two young eagles.  ThePrince seeing the danger of the young birds, drew his sword, and killedthe serpent; at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in the air,and the two old eagles, who had been out hunting for food for theiryoung ones, returned.  They quickly saw the dead serpent and the youngPrince standing over it; and the old mother eagle said to him, "Dearboy, for many' years all our young ones have been devoured by thatcruel serpent; you have now saved the lives of our children; wheneveryou are in need therefore, send to us and we will help you; and as forthese little eagles, take them, and let them be your servants."At this the Prince was very glad, and the two eaglets crossed theirwings, on which he mounted; and they carried him far, far away over thethick, jungles, until he came to the place where grew the circle ofpalm trees, in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of water.It was the middle of the day, and the heat was very great.  All roundthe trees were the genii fast asleep; nevertheless, there were suchcountless thousands of them, that it would have been quite impossiblefor anyone to walk through their ranks to the place; down swooped thestrong-winged eaglets-down jumped the Prince; in an instant he hadoverthrown the six chattees full of water, and seized the little greenparrot, which he rolled up in his cloak; while, as he mounted againinto the air, all the genii below awoke, and finding their treasuregone, set up a wild and melancholy howl.Away, away flew the little eagles, till they came to their home in thegreat tree; then the Prince said to the old eagles, "Take back yourlittle ones; they have done me good service; if ever again I stand inneed of help, I will not fail to come to you."  He then continued hisjourney on foot till he arrived once more at the Magician's palace,where he sat down at the door and began playing with the Parrot.Punchkin saw him, and came to him quickly, and said, "My boy, where didyon get that parrot?  Give it to me, I pray you."But the Prince answered, "Oh no, I cannot give away my parrot, it is agreat pet of mine; I have had it many years."Then the Magician said, "If it is an old favorite, I can understandyour not caring to give it away; but come, what will you sell it for?""Sir," said the Prince, "I will not sell my parrot."Then Punchkin got frightened, and said, "Anything, anything; name whatprice you will, and it shall be yours."  The Prince answered, "Let theseven Raja's sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantlyliberated.""It is done as you desire," said the Magician, "only give me myparrot."  And With that, by a stroke of his wand, Balna's husband andhis brothers resumed their natural shapes.  "Now, give me my parrot,"repeated Punchkin."Not so fast, my master," rejoined the Prince; "I must first beg thatyou will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned."The Magician immediately waved his wand again; and whilst he cried, inan imploring voice, "Give me my parrot!' the whole garden becamesuddenly alive: where rocks, and stones, and trees had been before,stood Rajas, and Punts, and Sirdars, and mighty men on prancing horses,and jeweled pages, and troops of armed attendants."Give me my parrot!" cried Punchkin.  Then the boy took hold of theparrot, and tore off one of its wings; and as he did so the Magician'sright arm fell off.Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, "Give me my parrot!"The Prince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the Magician's leftarm tumbled off."Give me my parrot!" cried he, and fell on his knees.  The Princepulled off the parrot's right leg, and the Magician's right leg felloff: the Prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell theMagician's left.Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but stillhe rolled his eyes, and cried "Give me my parrot!"  "Take your parrot,then, cried the boy, and with that.  he wrung the bird's neck, andthrew it at the magician; and as he did so, Punchkin's head twistedround and, with a fearful groan, he died!Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the sevenPrinces went to their own country, and lived very happily everafterward.  And as to the rest of the world, everyone went to his ownhouse.HOW SUN, MOON AND WIND WENT OUT TO DINNERBy E. FrereONE day Sun, Moon, and Wind went out to dine with their uncle and auntThunder and Lightning.  Their mother (one of the most distant Stars yousee far up in the sky) waited alone for her children's return.Now both Sun and Wind were greedy and selfish.  They enjoyed the greatfeast that had been prepared for them, without a thought of saving anyof it to take home to their mother-but the gentle Moon did not forgether.  Of every dainty dish that was brought round, she placed a smallportion under one of her beautiful long fingernails, that Star mightalso have a share in the treat.On their return, their mother, Who had kept watch for them all nightlong with her little bright eye, said, "Well, children, what have yonbrought home for me?"  Then Sun (who was eldest) said, "I have broughtnothing home for you.  I went out to enjoy myself with my friends-notto fetch dinner for my mother!"  And Wind said, "Neither have I broughtanything home for you, mother.  You could hardly expect me to bring acollection of good things for you, when I merely went out for my ownpleasure."  But Moon said, "Mother, fetch a plate, see what I havebrought you."  And shaking her hands she showered down such a choicedinner as never was seen before.Then Star turned to Sun and spoke thus, "Because you went out to amuseyourself with your friends, and feasted and enjoyed yourself, withoutany thought of our mother at home-you shall be cursed.  Henceforth,your rays shall ever be hot and scorching, and shall burn all that theytouch.  And men shall hate you, and cover their heads when you appear.(And that is why the Sun is so hot to this day.)Then she turned to Wind and said, "You also who forgot your mother inthe midst of your selfish pleasures-hear your doom.  You shall alwaysblow in the hot, dry weather, and shall parch and shrivel all livingthings.  And men shall detest and avoid you from this very time."(And that is why the Wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable.)But to Moon she said, "Daughter, because you remembered your mother,and kept for her a share in your own enjoyment, from henceforth youshall be ever cool, and calm and bright.  No noxious glare shallaccompany your pure rays, and men shall always call you 'blessed."(And that is why the Moon's light is so soft, and cool, and beautifuleven to this day.)WHY THE FISH LAUGHEDBy Joseph JacobsAs a certain fisherwoman passed by a palace crying her fish, the queenappeared at one of the windows and beckoned her to come near and showwhat she had.  At that moment a very big fish jumped about in thebottom of the basket."Is it a he or a she?"  inquired the queen.  "I wish to purchase a shefish."On hearing this the fish laughed aloud."It's a he," replied the fisherwoman, and proceeded on her rounds.The queen returned to her room in a great rage; and on coming to seeher in the evening, the king noticed that something had disturbed her."Are you indisposed?"  he said."No; but I am very much annoyed at the strange behavior of a fish.  Awoman brought me one to-day, and on my inquiring whether it was a maleor female, the fish laughed most rudely.""A fish laugh! Impossible! You must be dreaming.""I am not a fool.  I speak of what I have seen with my own eyes andheard with my own ears.""Passing strange! Be it so.  I will inquire concerning it."On the morrow the king repeated to his vizier what his wife had toldhim, and bade him investigate the matter, and be ready with asatisfactory answer within six mouths, on pain of death.  The vizierpromised to do his best, though he felt almost certain of failure.  Forlive months he labored indefatigably to find a reason for the laughterof the fish.  He sought everywhere and from everyone.  The wise andlearned, and they who were skilled in magic and in all manner oftrickery, were consulted.  Nobody, however, could explain the matter;and so he returned broken-hearted to his house, and began to arrangehis affairs in prospect of certain death, for he had had sufficientexperience of the king to know that His Majesty would not go back fromhis threat.  Amongst other things, he advised his son to travel for atime, until the king's anger should have somewhat cooled.The young fellow, who was both clever and handsome, started offwhithersoever Kismet might lead him.  He had been gone some days, whenhe fell in with an old farmer, who also was on a journey to a certainvillage.  Finding the old man very pleasant, he asked him if he mightaccompany him, professing to be on a visit to the same place.  The oldfarmer agreed, and they walked along together.  The day was hot, andthe way was long and weary."Don't yon think it would be pleasanter if you and I sometimes gave oneanother a lift?"  said the youth."What a fool the man is!" thought the old farmer.Presently they passed through a field of corn ready for the sickle, andlooking' like a sea of gold as it waved to and fro in the breeze."Is this eaten or not?"  said the young man.Not understanding his meaning, the old man replied, "I don't know."After a little while the two travelers arrived at a big village, wherethe young man gave his companion a clasp knife, and said, "Take this,friend, and get two horses with it; but mind and bring it back, for itis very precious."The old man, looking half amused and half angry, pushed back the knife,muttering something to the effect that his friend was either a foolhimself or else tying to play the fool with him.  The young manpretended not to notice his reply, and remained almost silent till theyreached the city, a short distance outside which was the old farmer'shouse.They walked about the bazaar and went to the mosque, but nobody salutedthem or invited them to come in and rest."What a large cemetery!" exclaimed the young man."What does the man mean," thought the old farmer, "calling this largelypopulated city a cemetery?"On leaving the city their way led through a cemetery where a few peoplewere praying beside a grave and distributing chupatties and kulchas toPassers-by, in the name of their beloved dead.  They beckoned to thetwo travelers and gave them as much as they would."What a splendid city this is!" said the young man."Now, the man must surely be demented!"  thought the old farmer.  "Iwonder what he will do next?  He will be calling the land water, andthe water land; and be speaking of light where there is darkness, andof darkness where it is light."  However, he kept his thoughts tohimself.Presently they had to wade through a stream that ran along the edge ofthe cemetery.  The water was rather deep, so the old farmer took offhis shoes and pajamas and crossed over; but the young man waded throughit with his shoes and pajamas on."Well!  I never did see such a perfect fool, both in word and in deed,said the old man to himself.However, he liked the fellow; and thinking that he would amuse his wifeand daughter, he invited him to come and stay at his house as long ashe had occasion to remain in the village."Thank you very much," the young man replied; "but let me firstinquire, if you please, whether the beam of your house is strong. "The old farmer left him in despair, and entered his house laughing."There is a man in yonder field," he said, after returning theirgreetings.  "He 'has come the greater part of the way with me, and Iwanted him to put up here as long as he had to stay in this village.But the fellow is such a fool that I cannot make anything out of him.He wants to know if the beam of this house is all right.  The man mustbe mad!" and saying this he burst into a fit of laughter."Father," said the farmer's daughter, who was a very sharp and wisegirl, "this man, whosoever he is, is no fool, as you deem him.  He onlywishes to know if you can afford to entertain him.""Oh! of course," replied the farmer.  "I see.  Well perhaps you canhelp me to solve some of his other mysteries.  While we were walkingtogether he asked whether he should carry me or I should carry him, ashe thought that would be a pleasanter mode of proceeding.""Most assuredly," said the girl.  "He meant that one of you should tella story to beguile the time.""Oh, yes.  Well, we were passing through a cornfield, when he asked mewhether it was eaten or not.""And didn't you know the meaning of this, father?  He simply wished toknow if the man was in debt or not; because if the owner of the fieldwas in debt, then the produce of the field was as good as eaten to him;that is, it would have to go to his creditors.""Yes, yes, yes; of course!  Then, on entering a certain village, hebade me take his clasp knife and get two horses with it, and bring backthe knife again to him.""Are not two stout sticks as good as two horses for helping one alongon the road?  He only asked you to cut a couple of sticks and becareful not to lose his knife.""I see," said time farmer.  "While we were walking over the city we didnot see anybody that we knew, and not a soul gave us a scrap ofanything to eat, till we were passing the cemetery; but there somepeople called to us and put into our hands some chupatties and kulchas;so my companion called the city a cemetery, and the cemetery a city.""This also is to be understood, father, if one thinks of the city asthe place where everything is to be obtained, and of inhospitablepeople as worse than the dead.  The city, though crowded with people,was as if dead, as far as you were concerned; while, in the cemetery,which is crowded with time dead, you were saluted by kind friends andprovided with bread.""True, true!" said the astonished farmer.  "Then, just now, when wewere crossing the stream, he waded through it without taking off hisshoes and pajamas.''"I admire his wisdom," replied time girl.  "I have often thought howstupid people were to venture into that swiftly flowing stream and overthose sharp stones with bare feet.  The slightest stumble and theywould fall, and be wetted from head to foot.  This friend of yours is amost wise man.  I should like to see him and speak to him.""Very well," said time farmer; "I will go and find him, and bring himin.""Tell him, father, that our beams are strong enough, and then he willcome in.  I'll send on ahead a present to the man, to show him that wecan afford to have him for our guest."Accordingly she called a servant and sent him to the young man with apresent of a basin of ghee, twelve chupatties, and a jar of milk, andthe following message: "O friend, time moon is full; twelve months makea year, and the sea is overflowing with water."Half-way the bearer of this present and message met his little son,who, seeing what was in the basket, begged his father to give him someof the food.  His father foolishly complied.  Presently he saw theyoung man, and gave him the rest of the present and the message."Give your mistress my salaam," he replied, "and tell her that the moonis new, and that I can only find eleven mouths in the year, and the seais by no means full."Not understanding the meaning of these words, the servant repeated themword for word, as he had heard them, to his mistress; and thus histheft was discovered, and he was severely punished.  After a littlewhile the young man appeared with the old farmer.  Great attention wasshown to him, and he was treated in every way as it he were the son ofa great man, although his humble host knew nothing of his origin.  Atlength be told them everything-about the laughing of the fish, hisfather's threatened execution, and his own banishment-and asked theiradvice as to what he should do."The laughing of the fish,'' said the girl "which seems to have beenthe cause of all this trouble, indicates that there is a man in thepalace who is plotting against the king's life.""Joy, joy!" exclaimed the vizier's son.  "There is yet time for me toreturn and save my father from an ignominious and unjust death, and theking from danger."The following day he hastened back to his own country, taking with himthe farmer's daughter.  Immediately on arrival he ran to the palace andinformed his father of what he had heard.  The poor vizier, now almostdead from the expectation of death, was at once carried to the king, towhom he repeated the news that his son had just brought."Never!" said the king."But it must be so, Your Majesty," replied the vizier; "and in order toprove the truth of what I have heard, I pray you call together all themaids in your palace, and order them to jump over a pit, which must bedug.  We'll soon find out whether there is any man there."The king had time pit dug, and commanded all the maids belonging to thepalace to try to jump it.  All of them tried, but only one succeeded.That one was found to be a man!Thus was the queen satisfied, and the faithful old vizier saved.Afterward, as soon as could be, the vizier's son married the oldfarmer's daughter; and a most happy marriage it was.THE FARMER AND THE MONEY LENDERBy Joseph JacobsTHERE was ounce a farmer who suffered much at time hands of the moneylender.  Good harvests, or bad, the farmer was always poor, the moneylender rich.  At the last, when he hadn't a farthing left, the farmerwent to the money lender's house, and said, "You can't squeeze waterfrom a stone, and as you have nothing to get by me now, you might tellme the secret of becoming rich.""My friend," returned the money lender, piously, "riches come from Ram-ask him.""Thank you, I will!" replied the simple farmer; so he prepared threegriddle cakes to last him on the journey, and set out to find Ram.First he met a Brahman, and to him he gave a cake asking him to pointout the road to Ram; but the Brahman only took the cake and went on hisway without a word.  Next the farmer met a Jogi or devotee, and to himhe gave a cake, without receiving any help in return.  At last, he cameupon a poor man sitting under a tree, and finding out he was hungry,the kindly farmer gave him his last cake, and sitting clown to restbeside him, entered into conversation."And where are you going?"  asked the poor man, at length."Oh, I have a long journey before me, for I am going to find Ram!"replied the farmer.  "I don't suppose you could tell me which way togo?""Perhaps I can," said the poor man, smiling, "for I am Ram! What do youwant of me?"Then the farmer told the whole story, and Rain, taking pity on him,gave him a conch shell, and showed him how to blow it in a particularway, saying, "Remember! whatever you wish for, you have only to blowthe conch that way, and your wish will be fulfilled.  Only have a careof that money lender, for even magic is not proof against their wiles!"The farmer went back to his village rejoicing.  In fact the moneylender noticed his high spirits at once, and said to himself, "Somegood fortune must have befallen the stupid fellow, to make him hold hishead so jauntily."  Therefore he went over to the simple farmer'shouse, and congratulated him on his good fortune, in such cunningwords, pretending to have heard all about it, that before long thefarmer found himself telling the whole story-all except the secret ofblowing the conch, for, with all his simplicity, the farmer was notquite such a fool as to tell that.Nevertheless, the money lender determined to have the conch by hook orby crook, and as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles, hewaited for a favorable opportunity and stole the conch.But, after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in everyconceivable way, he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad job.However, being determined to succeed he went back to the farmer andsaid, coolly, "Look here; I've got your conch, but I can't use it; youhaven't got it, So it's clear you can't use it either.  Business is ata standstill unless we make a bargain.  Now, I promise to give you backyour conch, and never to interfere with your using it, on onecondition, which is this-Whatever you get from it, I am to get double.""Never!" cried the farmer; "that would be the old business all overagain!""Not at all!" replied time wily money lender; "you will have yourshare!  Now, don't be a dog in the manger, for if you get all you want,what can it matter to you if I am rich or poor?"At last, though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefitto a money lender, the farmer was forced to yield, and from that time,no matter what he gained by the power of the couch, time money lendergained double.  And the knowledge that this was so preyed upon thefarmer's mind day and night, so that he had no satisfaction out ofanything.At last, there came a very dry season-so dry that the farmer's cropswithered for want of rain.  Then he blew his conch, and wished for awell to water them, and lo! there was the well, but the money lenderhad two!-two beautiful new wells!  This was too much for any farmer tostand: and our friend brooded over it, and brooded over it, till atlast a bright idea came into his head.  He seized the conch, blew itloudly, and cried out, "Oh Ram!  I wish to be blind of one eye!"  Andso he was in a twinkling, but the money lender of course was blind ofboth, and in trying to steer his way between the two new wells, he fellinto one and was drowned.Now this true story shows that a farmer once got time better of a moneylender-but only by losing one of his eyes.PRIDE GOETH BEFORE A FALLBy Joseph JacobsIN a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants who always wentabout together.  Once upon a time they had traveled far afield, andwere returning home with a great deal of money which they had obtainedby selling their wares.  Now there happened to be a dense forest neartheir village, and this they reached early one morning.  In it therelived three notorious robbers, of whose existence the traders had neverheard, and while they were still in the middle of it the robbers stoodbefore them, with swords and cudgels in their hands, and ordered themto lay down all they had.  The traders had no weapons with them, andso, though they were many more in number, they had to submit themselvesto the robbers, who took away everything from them, even the veryclothes they wore, and gave to each only a small loin cloth a span inbreadth and a cubit in length.The idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all theirproperty now took possession of the robbers' minds.  They seatedthemselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered, andordered them to dance to them before returning home.  The merchants nowmourned their fate.They had lost all they had, except their loin cloth, and still therobbers were not satisfied, but ordered them to dance.There was, among the ten merchants, one who was very clever.  Hepondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends, thedance they would have to perform, and the magnificent manner in whichthe three robbers had seated themselves on the grass.  At the same timehe observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground, inthe assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders, who were nowcommencing to dance.  So he took the lead in the dance, and, as a songis always sung by the leader on such occasions, to which the rest keeptime with hands and feet, he thus began to sing:	We are enty men,	They are erith men:	If each erith man	Surround eno men,	Eno man remains.	Ta, tai, tom, tadingana.The robbers were all uneducated, and thought that the leader was merelysinging a song as usual.  So it was in one sense: for the leadercommenced from a distance, and had sung the song over twice before heand his companions commenced to approach the robbers.  They hadunderstood his meaning, because they had been trained in trade.When two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of apurchaser, they use a riddling sort of language."What is the price of this cloth?"  one trader will ask another."Enty rupees," another will reply, meaning "ten rupees."Thus, there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meantunless he be acquainted with trade language.  By the rules of thissecret language erith means "three," enty means "ten," and eno means"one."  So the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellow-tradersthat they were ten men, the robbers only three, that if three pouncedupon each of the robbers, nine of them could hold them down, while theremaining one bound the robbers' hands and feet.The three thieves, glorying in their victory, and little understandingthe meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers, were proudlyseated chewing betel and tobacco.  Meanwhile the song was sung a thirdtime.  Ta, tai, tom had left the lips of the singer; and, beforetadingana was out of them, the traders separated into parties of three,and each party pounced upon a thief.  The remaining one-the leaderhimself-tore up into long narrow strips a large piece of cloth, sixcubits long, and tied the hands and feet of the robbers.  These wereentirely humbled now, and rolled on the ground like three bags of rice!The ten traders now took back all their property, and armed themselveswith the swords and cudgels of their enemies; and when they reachedtheir village, they often amused their friends and relatives byrelating their adventure.HOW THE WICKED SONS WERE DUPEDBy Joseph JacobsA VERY wealthy old man, imagining that he was on the point of death,sent for his sons and divided his property among them.  However, he didnot die for several years afterward, and miserable years many of themwere.  Besides the weariness of old age, the old fellow had to bearwith much abuse and cruelty from his sons.  Wretched, selfish ingrates!Previously they vied with one another in trying to please their father,hoping thus to receive more money, but now they had received theirpatrimony, they cared not how soon he left them-nay, the sooner thebetter, because he was only a needless trouble and expense.  And theylet the poor old man know what they felt.One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles.  Thefriend sympathized very much with him, and promised to think over thematter, and call in a little while and tell him what to do.  He did so;in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full ofstones and gravel before him."Look here, friend," said he.  "Your sons will get to know of my cominghere to-day, and will inquire about it.  You must pretend that I cameto discharge a long-standing debt with you, and that you are severalthousands of rupees richer than you thought you were.  Keep these bagsin your own hands, and on no account let your sons get to them as longas you are alive.  You will soon find them change their conduct towardyou.  Salaam, I will come again soon to see how you are getting on."When the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth theybegan to be more attentive and pleasing to their father than everbefore.  And thus they continued to the day of the old man's demise,when the bags were greedily opened, and found to contain only stonesand gravel!THE TIGER, THE BRAHMAN, AND THE JACKALBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time a Tiger was caught in a trap.  He tried in vain to getout through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when hefailed.By chance a poor Brahman came by."Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!" cried the Tiger."Nay, my friend," replied the Brahman mildly, you would probably eat meif I did.""Not at all!" swore the Tiger with many oaths; "on the contrary, Ishould be forever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"Now when the Tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the piousBrahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door ofthe cage.  Out popped the Tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried,"What a fool you are!  What is to prevent my eating you now, for afterbeing cooped up so long I am terribly hungry!"In vain the Brahman Pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was apromise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose toquestion as to the justice of the Tiger's action.So the Brahman first asked a Pipal Tree what it thought of the matter,but the Pipal Tree replied coldly, "What have you to complain about?Don't I give shade and shelter to everyone who passes by, and don'tthey in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle?  Don'twhimper-be a. man! "Then the Brahman sad at heart, went farther afield till he saw aBuffalo turning a well wheel; but he fared no better from it, for itanswered, "You are a fool to expect gratitude!  Look at me!  While Igave milk they fed me on cottonseed and oil cake, but now I am dry theyyoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!"The Brahman, still more sad, asked the Road to give him its opinion."My dear sir,'' said the Road, "how foolish you are to expect anythingelse!  Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, greatand small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but theashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!"On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met aJackal, who called out, "Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman?  You lookas miserable as a fish out of water!"The Brahman told him all that had occurred."How very confusing!" said the Jackal, when the recital was ended;"would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixedup?"The Brahman told it all over again, but the Jackal shook his head in adistracted sort of way, and still could not understand."It's very odd," said he, sadly, "but it all seems to go in at one earand out at the other!  I will go to the place where it all happened,and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment. "So they returned to the cage, by which the Tiger was waiting for theBrahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws."You've been away a long time!" growled the savage beast, "but now letus begin our dinner.""Our dinner!" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knockedtogether with fright; "what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!""Give mime five minutes, my lord!" he pleaded, "in order that I mayexplain matters to the Jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."The Tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again,not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible.''Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!" cried the Jackal, wringing itspaws.  "Let me see! how did it all begin?  You were in the cage, andthe Tiger came walking by-""Pooh!" interrupted the Tiger, "what a fool you are!  I was in thecage.""Of course!" cried the Jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; "yesI was in the cage-no I wasn't-dear! dear, where are my wits?  Let mesee-the Tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by-no,that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, forI shall never understand!""Yes, you shall!" returned the Tiger, in a rage at the Jackal'sstupidity; "I'll make you understand!  Look here-I am the Tiger-""Yes, my lord!""And that is the Brahman-""Yes, my lord!""And that is the cage-""Yes, my lord!""And I was in the cage-do you understand?""Yes-no- Please, my lord-""Well?"  cried the Tiger impatiently."Please, my lord !-how did you get in?""How?-why, in the usual way, of course! ""Oh, dear me!-My head is beginning to whirl again! Please don't getangry, my lord, but what is the usual way?"At this the Tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried,"This way!  Now do you understand how it was?""Perfectly!" grinned the Jackal, as he dexterously shut the door.  "Andif you will permit me to say so, I think matters will remain as theywere!"THE LAMBIKINBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about onhis little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly.Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy tothink of all the good things he should get from her, when who should hemeet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said:"Lambikin!  Lambikin!  I'll EAT YOU!"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:	"To Granny's house I go,	Where I shall fatter grow,	Then you can eat me so."The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.By and by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at thetender morsel before him, said: "Lambikin!  Lambikin!  I'll EAT YOU!"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:	"To Granny's house I go,	Where I shall fatter grow,	Then you can eat me so."The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.And by and by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, arid anEagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:"Lambikin!  Lambikin!  I'll EAT YOU!"But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:	"To Granny's house I go,	Where I shall fatter grow,	Then you can eat me so.At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry,"Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought tokeep their promises, please put me into the corn bin at once."So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn bin,and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate,and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny saidhe was fat enough for anything, and must go home.  But cunning littleLambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eathim on the way back, he was so plump and tender."I'll tell you what you must do," said Master Lambikin, "you must makea little drumikin out of the skin of' my little brother who died, andthen I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as adrum myself."So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin,with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm inthe middle, and trundled away gayly.  Soon lie met with the Eagle, whocalled out:	"Drumikin!  Drumikin!	Have you seen Lambikin?"And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:	"Fallen into the fire, and so will you	On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!""How very annoying!" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of thetender morsel he had let slip.Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:	"Tum-pa, tum-too;	Tum-pa, tum-too!"Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:	"Drumikin!  Drumikin!	Have you seen Lambikin?"And to each of them the little slyboots replied:	"Fallen into the fire, and so will you	On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum-too;	Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!"Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had letslip.At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharpas a needle, and he too called out-	"Drumikin!  Drumikin!	Have you seen Lambikin?"And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gayly:	"Fallen into the fire, and so will you	On little Drumikin!  Tum-pa-"But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognized his voice atonce, arid cried: "Hullo!  you've turned yourself inside out, have you?Just you come out of that!"Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.THE RAT'S WEDDINGBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time a fat, sleek Rat was caught in a shower of rain, andbeing far from shelter he set to work and soon dug a nice hole in theground, in which he sat as dry as a bone while the raindrops splashedoutside, making little puddles on the road.Now in the course of digging, he came upon a fine bit of root, quitedry and fit for fuel, which he set aside carefully-for the Rat is aneconomical creature--in order to take it home with him.  So when theshower was over, he set off with the dry root in his mouth.  As he wentalong, daintily picking his way through the puddles, he Saw a Poor Manvainly trying to light a fire, while a little circle of children stoodby, and cried piteously."Goodness gracious!" exclaimed the Rat, who was both soft-hearted andcurious, "What a dreadful noise to make!  What is the matter?""The children are hungry," answered the Man; "they are crying for theirbreakfast, but the sticks are damp, the fire won't burn, and so I can'tbake the cakes.""If that is all your trouble, perhaps I can help you," said the good-natured Rat, "you are welcome to this dry root and I'll warrant it willsoon make a fine blaze."The Poor Man, with a thousand thanks, took the dry root, and in histurn presented the Rat with a morsel of dough, as a reward for hiskindness and generosity."What a remarkably lucky fellow I am!" thought the Rat, as he trottedoff gayly with his prize, "and clever, too!  Fancy making a bargainlike that-food enough to last me five days in return for a rotten oldstick!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  What it is to have brains!"Going along, hugging his good fortune in this way, he came presently toa Potter's yard, where the Potter, leaving his wheel to spin round byitself, was trying to pacify his three little children, who werescreaming arid crying as if they would burst."My gracious!" cried the Rat, stopping his ears, "what a noise!  dotell me what it is all about.""I suppose they are hungry," replied the Potter ruefully; "their motherhas gone to get flour in the bazaar, for there is none in the house.In the meantime I can neither work nor rest because of them.""Is that all?" answered the officious Rat; then I can help you.  Takethis dough, cook it quickly, and stop their mouths with food."The Potter overwhelmed the Rat with thanks for his obliging kindness,and choosing out a nice well-burned pipkin, insisted on his acceptingit as a remembrance.The Rat was delighted at the exchange, and though the pipkin was just atrifle awkward for him to manage, he succeeded, after infinite trouble,in balancing it on his head and went away gingerly, tink-a-tink, tin k-a-tink, down the road, with his tail over his arm for fear he shouldtrip on it.  And all the time he kept saying to himself, "What a luckyfellow I am!  and clever, too!  Such a hand at a bargain!"By and by he came to where some cowherds were herding their cattle.One of them was milking a buffalo, and having no pail, he used hisshoes instead."Oh fie!  oh fie!" cried the cleanly Rat, quite shocked at the sight."What a nasty, dirty trick!  Why don't you use a pail?""For the best of all reasons-we haven't got one!" growled the Cowherd,who did not see why the Rat should put his finger in the pie."If that is all," replied the dainty Rat, "oblige me by using thispipkin, for I cannot bear dirt!"The Cowherd, nothing loath, took the pipkin and milked away until itwas brimming over; then turning to the Rat, who stood looking on, said,"Here, little fellow, You may have a drink, in payment."But if the Rat was good-natured he was also shrewd.  "No, no, myfriend," said he, "that will not do!  As if I could drink the worth ofany pipkin at a draft!  My dear sir, I couldn't hold it!  Besides, Inever make a bad bargain, so I expect you, at least to give me thebuffalo that gave the milk.""Nonsense!" cried the Cowherd; "a buffalo for a pipkin!  Whoever heardof such a price?  And what on earth could you do with a buffalo whenyou got it?  Why, the pipkin was about as much as you could manage."At this the Rat drew himself up with dignity, for he did not likeallusions to his size.  "That is my affair, not yours," he retorted;"your business is to hand over the buffalo."So just for the fun of the thing, and to amuse themselves at the Rat'sexpense, the cowherds loosened the buffalo's halter and began to tie itto the little animal's tail."No!  no!' he called, in a great hurry.  "If the beast pulled, the skinof my tail would come off, and then where should I be?  Tie it aroundmy neck, if you please."So with much laughter the cowherds tied the halter round the Rat'sneck, and he, after a polite leave-taking, set off gayly toward homewith his prize; that is to say, he set off with the rope, for no soonerdid he come to the end of the tether than be was brought up with around turn; the buffalo, nose down, grazing away, would not budge untilit had finished its tuft of grass, and then seeing another in adifferent direction marched off toward it, while the Rat, to avoidbeing dragged, had to trot humbly behind, willy-nilly.  He was tooproud to confess the truth, of course, and, nodding his head knowinglyto the cowherds, said: "Ta-ta, good people!  I am going home this way.It may be a little longer, but it's much shadier."And when the cowherds roared with laughter he took no notice, buttrotted on, looking as dignified as possible.  "After all," he reasonedto himself, "when one keeps a buffalo one has to look after itsgrazing.  A beast must get a good bellyful of grass if it is to giveany milk, and I have plenty of time at my disposal."  So all day longhe trotted about after the buffalo, making believe; but by evening hewas dead tired, and felt truly thankful when the great big beast,having eaten enough, lay down under a tree to chew the cud.Just then a bridal party came by.  The Bridegroom and his friends hadevidently gone on to the next village, leaving the Bride's palanquin tofollow; so the palanquin bearers, being lazy fellows and seeing a niceshady tree, put down their burden, and began to cook some food."What detestable meanness!" grumbled one; "a grand wedding, and nothingbut plain rice to eat!  Not a scrap of meat in it, neither sweet norsalt!  It would serve the skinflints right if we upset the Bride into aditch!""Dear me!" cried the Rat at once, seeing a way out of his difficulty,"that is a shame!  I sympathize with your feelings so entirely that ifyou will allow me, I'll give you my buffalo.  You can kill it, and cookit.""Your buffalo!" returned the discontented bearers.  "What rubbish!Whoever heard of a rat owning a buffalo?""Not often, I admit," replied the Rat with conscious pride; "but lookfor yourselves.  Can you not see that I am leading the beast by astring?""Oh, never mind the string!" cried a great big hungry bearer; master orno master, I mean to have meat for my dinner!"  Whereupon they killedthe buffalo, and cooking its flesh, ate their dinner with a relish;then, offering the remains to the Rat, said carelessly, "Here, littleRat-skin, that is for you!""Now look here!" cried the Rat hotly; "I'll have none of your pottage,or your sauce, either.  You don't suppose I am going to give my bestbuffalo, that gave quarts and quarts of milk-the buffalo I have beenfeeding all day-for a wee bit of rice?  No!  I got a loaf for a bit ofstick; I got a pipkin for a little loaf; I got a buffalo for a pipkin;and now I'll have the Bride for my buffalo-the Bride, and nothingelse!"By this time the servants, having satisfied their hunger, began toreflect on what they had done, and becoming alarmed at theconsequences, arrived at the conclusion it would be wisest to maketheir escape while they could.  So, leaving the Bride in her palanquin,they took to their heels in various directions.The Rat, being as it were left in possession, advanced to thepalanquin, and drawing aside the curtain, with the sweetest of voicesand best of bows begged the Bride to descend.  She hardly knew whetherto laugh or to cry, but as any company, even a Rat's, was better thanbeing quite alone in the wilderness, she did what she was bidden, andfollowed the lead of her guide, who set off as fast as be could for hishole.As he trotted along beside the lovely young Bride, who, by her richdress and glittering jewels, seemed to be some king's daughter, he keptsaying to himself, "How clever I am!  What bargains I do make, to besure!"When they arrived at his hole, the Rat stepped forward with thegreatest politeness, and said, "Welcome, madam, to my humble abode!Pray step in, or if you will allow me, and as the passage is somewhatdark, I will show you the way."Whereupon he ran in first, but after a time, finding the Bride did notfollow, he put his nose out again, saying testily, "Well, madam, whydon't you follow?  Don't you know it's rude to keep your husbandwaiting?""My good sir," laughed the handsome young Bride, "I can't squeeze intothat little hole!"The Rat coughed; then after a moment's thought he replied, "There issome truth in your remark- you are overgrown, and I suppose I shallhave to build you a thatch somewhere, For to-night you can rest underthat wild plum tree.""But I am so hungry!" said the Bride ruefully."Dear, dear!  everybody seems hungry to-day!" returned the Ratpettishly; "however, that's easily settled-I'll fetch you Some supperin a trice."So he ran into his hole, returning immediately with an ear of milletand a dry pea.  "There!" said he, triumphantly, "isn't that a finemeal?""I can't eat that!" whimpered the Bride; "it isn't a mouthful; and Iwant rice pottage, and cakes, and sweet eggs, and sugar drops.  I shalldie if I don't get them!""Oh, dear me!" cried the Rat in a rage, "what a nuisance a bride is, tobe sure!  Why don't you eat the wild plums?""I can't live on wild plums!" retorted the weeping Bride; "nobodycould; besides, they are only half ripe, and I can't reach them.""Rubbish!" cried the Rat; "ripe or unripe, they must do you for to-night, and to-morrow you can gather a basketful, sell them in the city,and buy sugar drops and sweet eggs to your heart's content!"So the next morning the Rat climbed up into the plum tree, and nibbledaway at the stalks till the fruit fell down into the Bride's veil.Then, unripe as they were, she carried them into the city, calling outthrough the streets-	"Green plums I sell!  green plums I sell!	Princess am I, Rat's bride as well!"As she passed by the palace, her mother, the Queen, heard her voice,and running out, recognized her daughter.  Great were the rejoicings,for everyone thought the poor Bride had been eaten by wild beasts.In the midst of the feasting and merriment, the Rat, who had followedthe Princess at a distance, and had become alarmed at her long absence,arrived at the door, against which he beat with a big knobby stick,calling out fiercely, "Give me my wife!  Give me my wife!  She is mineby a fair bargain.  I gave a stick and I got a loaf; I gave a loaf andI got a pipkin; I gave a pipkin and I got a buffalo; I gave a buffaloand I got a bride.  Give me my wife!  Give me my wife!""La!  son-in-law!  What a fuss you do make," said the wily old Queenthrough the door, "and all about nothing!  Who wants to run away withyour wife?  On the contrary, we are proud to see you, and I only keepyou waiting at the door till we can spread the carpets, and receive youin style."Hearing this, the Rat was mollified, and waited patiently outside whilethe cunning old Queen prepared for his reception, which she did bycutting a hole in the very middle of a stool, putting a red hot stoneunderneath, covering it over with a stew-pan lid, and then spreading abeautiful embroidered cloth over all.  Then she went to the door, andreceiving the Rat with the greatest respect, led him to the stool,praying him to be seated."Dear!  dear!  how clever I am!  What bargains I do make, to be sure!"said he to himself as he climbed on to the stool.  "Here I am, son-in-law to a real live Queen!  What will the neighbors say?"At first he sat down on the edge of the stool, but even there it waswarm, and after a while he began to fidget, saying, "Dear me, mother-in-law, how hot your house is!  Everything I touch seems burning!""You are out of the wind there, my son," replied the cunning old Queen;"sit more in the middle of the stool, and then you will feel the breezeand get cooler."But he didn't!  for the stewpan lid by this time had become so hot thatthe Rat fairly frizzled when he sat down on it; and it was not until hehad left all his tail, half his hair, and a large piece of his skinbehind him, that he managed to escape, howling with pain, and vowingthat never, never, never again would he make a bargain!THE JACKAL AND THE PARTRIDGEBy Flora Annie SteelA JACKAL and a partridge swore eternal friendship; but the Jackal wasvery exacting and jealous.  "You don't do half as much for me as I dofor you," he used to say, "and yet you talk a great deal of yourfriendship.  Now my idea of a friend is one who is able to make melaugh or cry, give me a good meal, or save my life if need be.  Youcouldn't do that!""Let us see," answered the Partridge; "follow me at a little distance,and if I don't make you laugh soon you may eat me!"So she flew on till she met two travelers trudging along, one behindthe other.  They were both foot-sore and weary, and the first carriedhis bundle on a stick over his shoulder, while the second had his shoesin his hand.Lightly as a feather the Partridge settled on the first traveler'sstick.  He, none the wiser, trudged on, but the second traveler, seeingthe bird sitting so tamely just in front of his nose, said to himself,"What a chance for a supper!" and immediately flung his shoes at it,they being ready to hand.  Whereupon the Partridge flew away, and theshoes knocked off the first traveler's turban."What a plague do you mean?" cried he, angrily turning on hiscompanion.  "Why did you throw your shoes at my head?""Brother," replied the other mildly, "do not be vexed.  I didn't throwthem at you, but at a Partridge that was sitting on your stick.""On my stick!  Do you take me for a fool?" shouted the injured man, ina great rage.  "Don't tell me such cock-and-bull stories.  First youinsult me, and then you lie like a coward; but I'll teach you manners!"Then he fell upon his fellow traveler without more ado, and they foughtuntil they could not see out of their eyes, till their noses werebleeding, their clothes in rags, and the Jackal had nearly died oflaughing."Are you satisfied?" asked the Partridge of her friend."Well," answered the Jackal, "you have certainly made nine laugh, but Idoubt if you could make me cry.  It is easy enough to be a buffoon; itis more difficult to excite the highest emotions.""Let us see," retorted the Partridge, somewhat piqued; "there is ahuntsman with his dogs coming along the road.  Just creep into thathollow tree and watch me; if you don't weep scalding tears, you musthave no feeling in you!"The Jackal did as he was bid, and watched the Partridge, who beganfluttering about the bushes till the dogs caught sight of her, when sheflew to the hollow tree where the Jackal was hidden.  Of course thedogs smelt him at once, and set up such a yelping and scratching thatthe huntsman came up, and seeing what it was, dragged the Jackal out bythe tail.  Whereupon the dogs worried him to their heart's content, andfinally left him for dead.By and by he opened his eyes-for he was only foxing-and saw thePartridge sitting on a branch above him."Did you cry?" she asked anxiously.  "Did I rouse your high emo---""Be quiet, will you!" snarled the Jackal; half dead with fear!"So there the Jackal lay for some time, getting the better of hisbruises, and meanwhile he became hungry."Now is the time for friendship!" said he to the Partridge.  "Get me agood dinner, and I will acknowledge you a true friend.""Very well!" replied the Partridge; "only watch me, and help yourselfwhen the time comes."Just then a troop of women came by, carrying their husbands dinners tothe harvest field.  The Partridge gave a little plaintive cry, andbegan fluttering along from bush to bush as if she were wounded."A wounded bird!  a wounded bird!" cried the women; "we can easilycatch it."  Whereupon they set off in pursuit, but the cunningPartridge played a thousand tricks, till they became so excited overthe chase that they put their bundles on the ground in order to pursueit more nimbly.  The Jackal, meanwhile, seizing his opportunity, creptup, and made off with a good dinner."Are you satisfied now?" asked the Partridge."Well," returned the Jackal, "I confess you have given me a very gooddinner; you have also made me laugh-and cry-ahem!  But, after all, thegreat test of friendship is beyond you-you couldn't save my life!""Perhaps not," acquiesced the Partridge mournfully, "I am so small andweak.  But it grows late-we should be getting home; and as it is a longway round by the ford, let us go across the river.  My friend theCrocodile will carry us over."Accordingly they set off for the river, and the Crocodile kindlyconsented to carry them across, so they sat on his broad back and heferried them over.  But just as they were in the middle of the streamthe Partridge remarked.  "I believe the Crocodile intends to play us atrick.  How awkward if he were to drop you into the water!""Awkward for you, too!" replied the Jackal, turning pale."Not at all!  not at all!  I have wings, you haven't."On this the Jackal shivered and shook with fear, and when theCrocodile, in a gruesome growl, remarked that he was hungry and wanteda good meal, the wretched creature hadn't a word to say."Pooh!" cried the Partridge airily, "don't try tricks on us-I shouldfly away, and as for my friend, the Jackal, you couldn't hurt him.  Heis not such a fool as to take his life with him on these littleexcursions; he leaves it at home, locked up in the cupboard.""Is that a fact?" asked the Crocodile, surprised. "Certainly!" retortedthe Partridge.  Try to eat him if you like, but you will only tireyourself to no purpose."Dear me!  how very odd!" gasped time Crocodile; and he was so takenaback that he carried the Jackal safe to shore."Well, are you satisfied now?" asked the Partridge."My dear madam!" quoth the Jackal, "you have made me laugh, you havemade me cry, you have given me a good dinner, and you have saved mylife; but, upon my honor, I think you are too clever for a friend sogood-by!"And the Jackal never went near the Partridge again.THE JACKAL AND THE CROCODILEBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time Mr. Jackal was trotting along gayly, when lie caughtsight of a wild plum tree laden with fruit on the other side of abroad, deep stream.  I could not get across anyhow, so he just sat downon the bank and looked at the ripe, luscious fruit until his mouthwatered with desire.Now it so happened that, just then, Miss Crocodile came floating downstream with her nose in the air."Good morning, my dear!" said Mr. Jackal politely; "how beautiful youlook to-day, and how charmingly you swim!  Now, if I could only swimtoo, what a fine feast of plums we two friends might have over theretogether!"  And Mr. Jackal laid his paw on his heart, and sighed.Now Miss Crocodile had a very inflammable heart, and when Mr. Jackallooked at her so admiringly, and spoke so sentimentally, she simperedand blushed, saying, "Oh!  Mr. Jackal!  how can you talk so?  I couldnever dream of going out to dinner with you, unless-unless-""Unless what?" asked the Jackal persuasively."Unless we were going to be married!" simpered Miss Crocodile."And why shouldn't we be married, my charmer?" returned the Jackaleagerly.  "I would go and fetch the barber to begin the betrothal atonce, but I am so faint with hunger just at present that I should neverreach the village.  Now, if the most adorable of her sex would onlytake pity on her slave, and carry me over the stream, I might refreshmyself with those plums, and so gain strength to accomplish the ardentdesire of my heart!"Here the Jackal sighed so piteously, and cast such sheep's eyes at MissCrocodile, that she was unable to withstand him.  So she carried himacross to the plum tree, and then sat on the water's edge to think overher wedding dress, while Mr. Jackal feasted on the plums and enjoyedhimself."Now for the barber, my beauty!" cried the gay Jackal, when he hadeaten as much as he could.  Then the blushing Miss Crocodile carriedhim back again, and bade him be quick about his business, like a deargood creature, for really she felt so flustered at the very idea thatshe didn't know what might happen."Now don't distress yourself, my dear!" quoth the deceitful Mr. Jackal,springing to the bank, "because it's not impossible that I may not findthe barber, and then, you know, you may have to wait some time, aconsiderable time in fact, before I return.  So don't injure yourhealth for my sake, if you please."  With that he blew her a kiss, andtrotted away with his tail up.Of course he never came back, though trusting Miss Crocodile waitedpatiently for him; at last she understood what a gay, deceitful fellowhe was, and determined to have her revenge on him one way or another.So she hid herself in the water, under the roots of a tree, close to aford where the Jackal always came to drink.  By and by,  sure enough,he came lilting along in a self-satisfied way, and went right into thewater for a good long draft.  Whereupon Miss Crocodile seized him bythe right legs and held on.  He guessed at once what had happened, andcalled out, "Oh!  my heart's adored!  I'm drowning!  I'm drowning!  Ifyou love me, leave hold of that old root and get a good grip of my leg-it is just next door!"Hearing this, Miss Crocodile thought she must have made a mistake, and,letting go the Jackal's leg in a hurry, seized an old root close by,and held on.  Whereupon Mr. Jackal jumped nimbly to shore, and ran offwith his tail up, calling out, "Have a little patience, my beauty!  Thebarber will come some day!"But this time Miss Crocodile knew better than to wait, and being nowdreadfully angry, she crawled away to the Jackal's hole, and, slippinginside, lay quiet.By and by Mr. Jackal came lilting along with his tail up.  "Ho!  ho!That is your game, is it?" said he to himself, when he saw the trail ofthe Crocodile in the sandy soil.  So he stood outside, and said aloud,"Bless my stars!  What has happened?  I don't half like to go in, forwhenever I come home my wife always calls out,	'Oh, dearest hubby hub!	What have you brought for grub	to me and the darling cub?'and to-day she doesn't say anything!"Hearing this, Miss Crocodile sang out from inside,	"Oh, dearest hubby hub!	What have you brought for grub	To me and the darling cub?"The Jackal winked a very big wink, and, stealing in softly, stood atthe doorway.  Meanwhile Miss Crocodile, hearing him coming, held herbreath, and lay, shamming dead, like a big log."Bless my stars!" cried Mr. Jackal, taking out his pocket handkerchief,"how very sad!  Here's poor Miss Crocodile stone dead, and all for loveof me!  Dear!  dear!  Yet it is very odd, and I don't think she can bequite dead, you know-for dead folks always wag their tails!"On this, Miss Crocodile began to wag her tail very gently, and Mr.Jackal ran off, roaring with laughter, and saying.  "Oho!  oho!  sodead folks always wag their tails!"THE JACKAL AND THE IGUANABy Flora Annie SteelONE moonlight night a miserable, half-starved Jackal, skulking throughthe village, found a worn-out pair of shoes in the gutter.  They weretoo tough for him to eat, so, determined to make some use of them, hestrung them to his ears like earrings, and, going down to the edge ofthe pond, gathered all the old bones he could find together and built aplatform of them, plastering it over with mud.On this he sat in a dignified attitude, and when any animal came to thepond to drink, he cried out in a loud voice, "Hi!  stop!  You must nottaste a drop till you have done homage to me.  So repeat these verseswhich I have composed in honor of the occasion:	'Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!'"Now, as most of the animals were very thirsty, and in a great hurry todrink, they did not care to dispute the matter, but gabbled off thewords without a second thought.  Even the royal tiger, treating it as ajest, repeated the Jackal's rime, in consequence of which the latterbecame quite a cock-a-hoop, and really began to believe he was apersonage of great importance.By and by an Iguana, or big lizard, came waddling down to the water,looking for all the world like a baby alligator."Hi!  you there!" sang out the Jackal; "you mustn't drink until youhave said-	'Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!'""Pouf!  pouf!  pouf!" gasped the Iguana.  "Mercy on us, how dry mythroat is!  Mightn't I have just a wee sip of water first?  and then Icould do justice to your admirable lines; at present I am as hoarse asa crow!""By all means," replied the Jackal, with a gratified smirk.  "I flattermyself the verses are good, especially when well recited."So the Iguana, nose down in the water, drank away until the Jackalbegan to think he would never leave off, and was quite taken aback whenhe finally came to an end of his draft, and began to move away."Hi!  hi!" cried the Jackal, recovering his presence of mind, "stop abit, and say---	'Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!'""Dear me!" replied the Iguana, politely, "I was very near forgetting!Let me see-I must try my Voice first-do, re, me, fa, sol, la, si-thatis right!  Now, how does it run?"	"Silver is his dais, plastered o'er with gold;	In his ears are jewels,-some prince I must behold!"repeated the Jackal, not observing that the Lizard Was carefully edgingfarther and farther away."Exactly so," returned the Iguana; "I think I could say that!"Whereupon he sang out at the top of his voice-	"Bones made up his dais, with mud it's plastered o'er,	Old shoes are his eardrops; a jackal, nothing more!"And turning round, he bolted for his hole as hard as he could.The Jackal could scarcely believe his ears, and sat dumb withastonishment.  Then, rage lending him wings, he flew after the Lizard,who, despite his short legs and scanty breath, put his best footforemost, and scuttled away at a great rate.It was a near race, however, for just as he popped into his hole, theJackal caught him by the tail, and held on.  Then it was a case of"pull, butcher; pull, baker," until the Lizard made certain his tailmust come off, and he felt as if his front teeth would come out.  Stillnot an inch did either budge, one way or the other, and there theymight have remained till the present day, had not the Iguana calledout, in his sweetest tones, "Friend, I give in!  Just leave hold of mytail, will you?  then I can turn round and come out."Whereupon the Jackal let go, and the tail disappeared up the hole in atwinkling; while all the reward the Jackal got for digging away untilhis nails were nearly worn out was hearing the Iguana sing softly-	"Bones made up his dais, with mud it's plastered o'er,	Old shoes are his eardrops; a jackal, nothing moreTHE BEAR'S BAD BARGAINBy Flora Annie SteelONCE upon a time a very old Woodman lived with his very old Wife in atiny hut close to the orchard of a very rich man, so close that theboughs of a pear tree hung right over the cottage yard.  Now it wasagreed between the rich man and the Woodman that if any of the fruitfell into the yard, the old couple were to be allowed to eat it; so youmay imagine with what hungry eyes they watched the pears ripening, andprayed for a storm of wind, or a flock of flying foxes, or anythingwhich would cause the fruit to fall.  But nothing came, and the oldWife, who was a grumbling, scolding old thing, declared they wouldinfallibly become beggars.  So she took to giving her husband nothingbut dry bread to eat, and insisted on his working harder than ever,till the poor soul got quite thin; and all because the pears would notfall down!At last the Woodman turned round and declared he would not work moreunless his Wife gave him Khichri for his dinner; so with a very badgrace the old woman took some rice and pulse, some butter and spices,and began to cook a savory Khichri.  What an appetizing smell it had,to be sure!  The Woodman was for gobbling it up as soon as ever it wasready.  "No, no," cried the greedy old Wife, not till you have broughtme in another load of Wood; and mind it is a good one.  You must workfor your dinner."So the old man set off to the forest and began to hack and to hew withsuch a will that he soon had quite a large bundle, and with everyfaggot he cut he seemed to smell the savory Khichri and think of thefeast that was coming.Just then a Bear came swinging by, with its great black nose tilted inthe air, and its little keen eyes peering about; for bears, though goodenough fellows on the whole, are just dreadfully inquisitive."Peace be with you, friend," said the Bear, "and what may you be goingto do with that remarkably large bundle of wood?""It is for my Wife," returned the Woodman.  "The fact is," he addedconfidentially, smacking his lips, "she has made such a Khichri fordinner!  and if I bring in a good bundle of wood she is pretty sure togive me a plentiful portion.  Oh, my dear fellow, you should just smellthat Khichri."At this the Bear's mouth began to water, for, like all bears, he was adreadful glutton."Do you think your Wife would give mite some, too, if I brought her abundle of wood?" he asked anxiously."Perhaps; if it is a very big load," answered the Woodman craftily."Would-would four hundredweight be enough?" asked the Bear."I'm afraid not," returned the 'Woodman, shaking his head; "you seeKhichri is an expensive dish to make-there is rice in it, and plenty ofbutter, and pulse, and-""Would-would eight hundredweight do?""Say half a ton, and it's a bargain!" quoth the Woodman."Half a ton is a large quantity!" sighed the Bear."There is saffron in the Khichri," remarked the Woodman, casually.The Bear licked his lips, and his little eyes twinkled with greed anddelight."Well it's a bargain!  Go home sharp and tell your Wife to keep theKhichri hot; I'll be with you in a trice."Away went the Woodman in great glee to tell his Wife how the Bear hadagreed to bring half a ton of wood in return for a share of theKhichri.Now the wife could not help allowing that her husband had made a goodbargain, but being by nature a grumbler, she was determined not to bepleased, so she began to scold the old man for not having settledexactly the share the Bear was to have.  "For," said she, "he willgobble up the potful before we have finished our first helping."On this the Woodman became quite pale.  "In that case," he said, "wehad better begin now, and have a fair start." So without more ado theysquatted down on the floor, with the brass pot full of Khichri betweenthem, and began to eat as fast as they could."Remember to leave some for the Bear, Wife," said the Woodman, speakingwith his mouth crammed full."Certainly, certainly," she replied, helping herself to anotherhandful."My dear," cried the old woman in her turn, with her mouth so full shecould hardly speak, "remember the poor Bear!""Certainly, certainly, my love!" returned the old man, taking anothermouthful.So it went on, till there was not a single grain left in the pot."What's to be done now?" said the Woodman; "it is all your fault, Wife,for eating so much.""My fault!" retorted his Wife scornfully, "why, you ate twice as muchas I did!""No, I didn't!""Yes, you did! Men always eat more than women."No, they don't!""Yes, they do!""Well, it's no use quarreling about it now," said the Woodman, "theKhichri's gone, and the Bear will be furious.""That wouldn't matter much if we could get the wood," said the greedyold woman.  "I'll tell you what we must do-we must lock up everythingthere is to eat in the house, leave the Khichri pot by the fire, andhide in the garret.  When the Bear comes he will think we have gone outand left his dinner for him.  Then he will throw down his bundle andcome in.  Of course he will rampage a little when he finds the pot isempty, but he can't do much mischief, and I don't think he will takethe trouble of carrying the wood away."So they made haste to lock up all the food and hide themselves in thegarret.Meanwhile the Bear had been toiling and moiling away at his bundle ofwood, which took him much longer to collect than he expected; however,at last he arrived quite exhausted at the woodcutter's cottage.  Seeingthe brass Khichri pot by the fire, he threw down his load and went in.And then-mercy!  wasn't he angry when he found nothing in it-not even agrain of rice, nor a tiny wee bit of pulse, but only a smell that wasso uncommonly nice that he actually cried with rage and disappointment.He flew into the most dreadful temper, but though he turned the housetopsy-turvy, he could not find a morsel of food.  Finally, he declaredhe would take the wood away again, but, as the crafty old woman hadimagined, when he came to the task, he did not care, even for the sakeof revenge, to carry so heavy a burden."I won't go away empty-handed," said he to himself, seizing the Khichripot; "if I can't get the taste I'll have the smell!"Now, as he left the cottage, he caught sight of the beautiful goldenpears hanging over into the yard.  His mouth began to water at once,for he was desperately hungry, and the pears were the best of theseason.  In a trice he was on the wall, up the tree, and gathering thebiggest and ripest one he could find, was just putting it into hismouth when a thought struck him."If I take these pears home I shall be able to sell them for ever somuch to the other bears, and then with the money I shall be able to buysome Khichri.  Ha, ha!  I shall have the best of the bargain afterall!"So saying, he began to gather the ripe pears as fast as he could andput them in the Khichri pot, but whenever he came to an unripe one hewould shake his head and say, "No one would buy that, yet it is a pityto waste it."  So he would pop it into his mouth and eat it, making wryfaces if it was very sour.Now all this time the Woodman's Wife had been watching the Bear througha crevice, and holding her breath for fear of discovery; but, at last,what with being asthmatic, and having a cold in her head, she couldhold it no longer, and just as the Khichri pot was quite full of goldenripe pears, out she came with the most tremendous sneeze you everheard-"A-h-che-u !"The Bear, thinking some one had fired a gun at him, dropped the Khichripot into the cottage yard, and fled into the forest as fast as his legswould carry him.So the Woodrnan and his Wife got the Khichri, the wood, and the covetedpears, but the poor bear got nothing but a very bad stomachache fromeating unripe fruit.THE THIEF AND THE FOXBy Ramaswarni RajuA MAN tied his horse to a tree and went into an inn.  A Thief hid thehorse in a wood, and stood near the tree as if he had not done it."Did you see my horse?" said the man."Yes," said the Thief, "I saw the tree eat up your horse.''"How could the tree eat up my horse?" said the man."Why it did so," said the Thief.The two went to a Fox and told him of the case.  The Fox said.  "I amdull.  All last night the sea was on fire; I had to throw a great dealof hay into it to quench the flames; so come to-morrow, and I shallhear your case."Oh, you lie," said the Thief. "How could the sea burn?  How could hayquench the flames?""Oh, you lie," said the Fox, with a loud laugh; "how could a tree eatup a horse?"The Thief saw his lie had no legs, and gave the man his horse.THE FARMER AND THE FOXBy Ramaswami RajuA FARMER was returning from a fair which he had attended the previousday at a neighboring market town.  He had a quantity of poultry whichhe had purchased.  A Fox observed this, and approaching the Farmer,said, "Good morning, my friend.""What cheer, old fellow?" said the Farmer."I am just coming from the wood, through which you mean to go with yourpoultry.  A band of highwaymen has been tarrying there since daybreak.""Then what shall I do?" said the Farmer."Why," said the Fox, "if I were you I should stay here a while, andafter breakfast enter the wood, for by that time the robbers will haveleft the place.""So be it," said the Farmer, and had a hearty breakfast, with Reynardfor his guest.They kept drinking for a long time.  Reynard appeared to have lost hiswits; he stood up and played the drunkard to perfection.  The Farmer,who highly admired the pranks of his guest, roared with laughter, andgradually fell into a deep slumber.  It was some time after noon whenhe awoke.  To his dismay he found that the Fox was gone, and that thepoultry had all disappeared!"Alas!" said the Farmer, as he trudged on his way home with a heavyheart, "I thought the old rogue was quite drowned in liquor, but I nowsee it was all a pretense.  One must indeed be very sober to play thedrunkard to perfection."THE FOOLS AND THE DRUMBy Ramaswami RajuTWO FOOLS heard a Drum sounding, and said to themselves, There is someone inside it who makes the noise."So, watching a moment, when the drummer was out, they pierced a hole ineach side of it, and pushed their hands in.  Each felt the hand of theother within the Drum, and exclaimed, "I have caught him!"Then one said to the other, "Brother, the fellow seems to be a stubbornknave; come what will, we should not give in.""Not an inch, brother," said the other.So they kept pulling each other's hand, fancying it was the man in theDrum.  The drummer came up, and finding them in such an awkward plightshowed them with his fist who the man in the Drum really was.  But ashis fine Drum was ruined, he said, with a sigh, "Alas!  Fools havefancies with a triple wing!"THE LION AND THE GOATBy Ramaswami RajuA LION was eating up one after another the animals of a certaincountry.  One day an old Goat said, "We must put a stop to this.  Ihave a plan by which he may be sent away from this part of thecountry.""Pray act up to it at once," said the other animals.The old Goat laid himself down in a cave on the roadside, with hisflowing beard and long curved horns.  The Lion, on his way to thevillage, saw him, and stopped at the mouth of the cave."So you have come, after all," said the Goat."What do you mean?" said the Lion."Why, I have long been lying in this cave.  I have eaten up one hundredelephants, a hundred tigers, a thousand wolves, and ninety-nine lions.One more lion has been wanting.  I have waited long and patiently.Heaven has, after all, been kind to me," said the Goat, and shook hishorns and his beard, and made a start as if he were about to springupon the Lion.The latter said to himself, "This animal looks like a Goat, but it doesnot talk like one.  So it is very likely some wicked spirit in thisshape.  Prudence often serves us better than valor, so for the presentI shall return to the wood," and he turned back.The Goat rose up, and, advancing to the mouth of the cave, said, "Willyou come back tomorrow?""Never again," said the Lion."Do you think I shall be able to see you, at least, in the wood to-morrow?""Neither in the wood nor in this neighborhood any more," said the Lion,and running to the forest, soon left it with his kindred.The animals in the country, not hearing him roar any more, gatheredround the Goat, and said, "The wisdom of one doth save a host."THE GLOWWORM AND THE JAC KDAWBy Ramaswami RajuJACKDAW once ran up to a Glowworm and was about to seize him.  "Wait amoment, good friend," said the Worm, "and you shall hear something toyour advantage.""Ah!  what is it?" said the Daw."I am but one of the many glowworms that live in this forest.  If youwish to have them all, follow me," said the Glowworm."Certainly!" said the Daw.Then the Glowworm led him to a place in the wood where a fire had beenkindled by some woodmen, and pointing to the sparks flying about, said,"There you find the glowworms warming themselves round a fire.  Whenyou have done with them I shall show you some more, at a distance fromthis place."The Daw darted at the sparks and tried to swallow some of them, but hismouth being burned by the attempt, he ran away exclaiming, "Ah, theGlowworm is a dangerous little creature!"THE CAMEL AND THE PIGBy Ramaswami RajuA CAMEL said, "Nothing like being tall!  Look how tall I am!"A Pig, who heard these words, said, "Nothing like being short!  Lookhow short I am!"The Camel said, "Well, if I fail to prove the truth of what I said.  Ishall give up my hump."The Pig said, "If I fail to prove the truth of what I have said, Ishall give up my snout.""Agreed!" said the Camel."Just so!" said the Pig.They came to a garden, inclosed by a low wall without any opening.  TheCamel stood on this side of the wall, and reaching the plants within bymeans of his long neck, made a breakfast on them.  Then he turned,jeeringly to the Pig, who had been standing at the bottom of the wall,without even having a look at the good things in the garden, and said,"Now, would you be tall or short?"Next they came to a garden, inclosed by a high wall, with a wicket gateat one end.  The Pig entered by the gate, and, after having eaten hisfill of the vegetables within, came out, laughing at the poor Camel,who had had to stay outside because he was too tall to enter the gardenby the gate, and said, "Now, would you be tall or short?"Then they thought the matter over and came to the conclusion that theCamel should keep his hump and the Pig his snout, observing, "Tall isgood, where tall would do; of short, again, 'tis also true!"THE DOG AND.  THE DOG DEALERBy Ramaswami RajuA DOG was standing by the cottage of a peasant.  A man who dealt indogs passed by the way.  The Dog said, "Will you buy me?"The man said, "Oh, you ugly little thing!  I would not give a quarterof a penny for you!"Then the Dog went to the palace of the king and stood by the portal.The sentinel caressed it, and said, "You are a charming littlecreature!"Just then the Dog Dealer came by.  The Dog said, "Will you buy me?""Oh," said the man, "you guard the palace of the king, who must havepaid a high price for you.  I cannot afford to pay the amount, else Iwould willingly take you.""Ah!" said the Dog, "how place and position affect people!"THE TIGER, THE FOX, AND THE HUNTERSBy Ramaswami RajuA FOX was once caught in a trap.  A hungry Tiger saw him and said, "Soyou are here!""Only on your account," said the Fox in a whisper."How so?" said the Tiger."Why, you were complaining you could not get men to eat, so I got intothis net to-day, that you may have the men when they come to take me,"said the Fox, and gave a hint that if he would wait a while in athicket close by he would point out the men to him."May I depend upon your word?" said the Tiger."Certainly," said the Fox.The Hunters came, and seeing the Fox in the net, said, "So you arehere!""Only on your account," said the Fox, in a whisper."How so?" said the men."Why, you were complaining you could not get at the Tiger that has beendevouring your cattle; I got into this net to-day that you may havehim.  As I expected, he came to eat me up, and is in yonder thicket, "said the Fox, and gave a hint that if they would take him out of thetrap he would point out the Tiger."May we depend upon your word?" said the men."Certainly," said the Fox, while the men went with him in a circle tosee that he did not escape.Then the Fox said to the Tiger and the men, "Sir Tiger, here are themen; gentlemen, here is the Tiger."The men left the Fox and turned to the Tiger.  The former beat a hastyretreat to the wood, saying, "I have kept my promise to both; now youmay settle it between yourselves."The Tiger exclaimed, when it was too late, "Alas!  what art for adouble part!"THE SEA, THE FOX, AND THE WOLFBy Ramaswami RajuA FOX that lived by the seashore once met a 'Wolf that had never seenthe Sea.  The Wolf said, "What is the Sea?""It is a great piece of water by my dwelling," said the Fox."Is it under your control?" said the Wolf."Certainly," said the Fox."Will you show me the Sea, then?" said the Wolf."With pleasure," said the Fox.  So the Fox led the Wolf to the Sea andsaid to the waves, "Now go back"-they went back!  "Now come up"- andthey came up!  Then the Fox said to the waves, "My friend, the Wolf,has come to see you, so you will come up and go back till I bid youstop; and the Wolf saw with wonder the waves coming up and going back.He said to the Fox, "May I go into the Sea?""As far as you like.  Don't be afraid, for at a word, the Sea would goor come as I bid, and as you have already seen."The Wolf believed the Fox, and followed the waves rather far from theshore.  A great wave soon upset him, and threw his carcass on theshore.  The Fox made a hearty breakfast on it.THE FOX IN THE WELLBy Ramaswami RajuA FOX fell into a well and was holding hard to some roots at the sideof it, just above the water.  A Wolf, who was passing by, saw him, andsaid, "Hello, Reynard, after all you have fallen into a well!""But not without a purpose, and not without the means of getting out ofit," said the Fox."What do you mean?" said the Wolf."Why," said the Fox, "there is a drought all over the country now, andthe water in this well is the only means of appeasing the thirst of thethousands that live in this neighborhood.  They held a meeting, andrequested me to keep the water from going down lower; so I am holdingit up for the public good.""What will be your reward?" said the 'Wolf."They will give me a pension, and save me the trouble of going aboutevery day in quest of food, not to speak of innumerable otherprivileges that will be granted me.  Further, I am not to stay here allday.  I have asked a kinsman of mine, to whom I have communicated thesecret of holding up the water, to relieve me from time to time.  Ofcourse he will also get a pension, and have other privileges.  I expecthim here shortly.""Ah, Reynard, may I relieve you, then?  May I hope to get a pension andother privileges?  You know what a sad lot is mine, especially inwinter.""Certainly," said the Fox; "but you must get a long rope, that I maycome up and let you in.So the Wolf got a rope.  Up came the Fox and down went the wo1f, whenthe former observed, with a laugh, "My dear sir, you may remain theretill doomsday, or till the owner of the well throws up your carcass,"and left the place.ASHIEPATTLE AND HIS GOODLY CREWBy P. C. AsbjörnsenONCE upon a time there was a king, and this king had heard about a shipwhich went just as fast by land as by water; and as he wished to haveone like it, he promised his daughter and half the kingdom to anyonewho could build one for him.  And this was given out at every churchall over the country.  There were many who tried, as you can imagine;for they thought it would be a nice thing to have half the kingdom, andthe princess wouldn't be a bad thing into the bargain.  But they allfared badly.Now there were three brothers, who lived far away on the borders of aforest; the eldest was called Peter, the second Paul, and the youngestEspen Ashiepattle, because he always sat in the hearth, raking anddigging in the ashes.It so happened that Ashiepattle was at church on the Sunday when theproclamation about the ship, which the king wanted, was read.  When hecame home amid told his family, Peter, the eldest, asked his mother toget some food ready for him, for now he was going away to try if hecould build the ship and win the princess and half the kingdom.  Whenthe bag was ready lie set out.  On the way he met an old man who wasvery crooked and decrepit."Where are you going?" said the man."I'm going into the forest to make a trough for my father.  He doesn'tlike to eat at table in our company," said Peter."Trough it shall he!" said the man.  "What have you got in that bag ofyours?" he added."Stones," said Peter."Stones it shall be," said the man.  Peter then went into the forestand began to cut and chop away at the trees and work away as hard as hecould, but in spite of all his cutting and chopping he could only turnout troughs.  Toward dinner time he wanted something to eat and openedhis bag.  But there was not a crumb of food in it.  As he had nothingto live upon, and as he did not turn out anything but troughs, hebecame tired of the work, took his ax and bag on his shoulder, and wenthome to his mother.Paul then wanted to set out to try his luck at building the ship andwinning the princess and half the kingdom.  He asked his mother forprovisions, and when the bag was ready he threw it over his shoulderand went on his way to the forest.  On the road he met the old man, whowas very crooked and decrepit."Where are you going?" said the man."Oh, I am going into the forest to make a trough for our sucking pig,"said Paul."Pig trough it shall be," said the man.  "What have you got in that bagof yours?" added the man."Stones," said Paul. "Stones it shall be," said the man.Paul then began felling trees and working away as hard as he could, butno matter how he cut and how he worked he could only turn out pigtroughs.  He did not give in, however, but worked away till far intothe afternoon before he thought of taking any food; then all at once hebecame hungry and opened his bag, but not a crumb could he find.  Paulbecame so angry he turned the bag inside out and struck it against thestump of a tree; then lie took his ax, went out of the forest, and setoff homeward.As soon as Paul returned, Ashiepattle wanted to set out and asked hismother for a bag of food."Perhaps I can manage to build the ship and win the princess and halfthe kingdom," said he."Well, I never heard the like," said his mother.  "Are you likely towin the princess, you, who never do anything but root and dig in theashes?  No, you shan't have any bag with food!"Ashiepattle did not give in, however, but he prayed and begged till hegot leave to go.  He did not get any food, not he; but he stole acouple of oatmeal cakes and some flat beer and set out.When he had walked a while he met the same old man, who was so crookedand tattered and decrepit."'Where are you going?" said the man."Oh, I was going into the forest to try if it were possible to build aship which can go as fast by land as by water," said Ashiepattle, "forthe king has given out that anyone who can build such a ship shall havethe princess and half the kingdom.""What have you got in that bag of yours?" said the man."Not much worth talking about; there ought to be a little food in it,"answered Ashiepattle."If you'll give me a little of it I'll help you, said the man."With all my heart," said Ashiepattle, "but there is nothing but someoatmeal cakes and a drop of flat beer."It didn't matter what it was, the man said; if he only got some of ithe would be sure to help Ashiepattle.When they came up to an old oak in the wood the man said to the lad,"Now you must cut off a chip and then put it back again in exactly thesame place, and when you have done that you can lie down and go tosleep."Ashiepattle did as he was told and then lay down to sleep, and in hissleep lie thought he heard somebody cutting and hammering and sawingand carpentering, but he could not wake up till the man called him;then the ship stood quite finished by the side of the oak."Now you must go on board and everyone you meet you must take withyou," said the man.  Espen Ashiepattle thanked him for the ship, saidhe would do so, and then sailed away.When he had sailed some distance he came to a long, thin tramp, who waslying near some rocks, eating stones."What sort of a fellow are you, that you lie there eating stones?"asked Ashiepattle.  The tramp said he was so fond of meat he couldnever get enough, therefore he was obliged to eat stones.  And then heasked if he might go with him in the ship."If you want to go with us, you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would, but he must take with him some large stones forfood.When they had sailed some distance they met one who was lying on theside of a sunny hill, sucking at a bung."Who are you," said Ashiepattle, "and what is the good of lying theresucking that bung?""Oh, when one hasn't got the barrel, one must be satisfied with thebung," said the man.  "I'm always so thirsty, I can never get enoughbeer and wine."  And then he asked for leave to go with him in theship."If you want to go with me you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would.  And so he went on board and took the bung with himto allay his thirst.When they had sailed a while again they met one who was lying with hisear to the ground, listening."Who are you, and what is the good of lying there on the groundlistening?" said Ashiepattle."I'm listening to the grass, for I have such good ears that I can hearthe grass growing," said the man.  And then he asked leave to go withhim in the ship.  Ashiepattle could not say nay to that, so he said:"If you want to go with me, you must make haste and get on board."Yes, the man would.  And he also went on board.When they had sailed some distance they came to one who was standingtaking aim with a gun."Who are you, and what is the good of standing there aiming like that?"asked Ashiepattle.So the man said: "I have such good eyes that I can hit anything, rightto the end of the world." And then he asked for leave to go with him inthe ship."If you want to go with me, you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would.  And he went on board.When they had sailed some distance again they came to one who washopping and limping about on one leg, and on the other he had seven tonweights."Who are you, said Ashiepattle, "and what is the good of hopping andlimping about on one leg with seven ton weights on the other?""I am so light," said the man, "that if I walked on both my legs Ishould get to the end of the world in less than five minutes." And thenhe asked for leave to go with him in the ship."If you want to go with us, you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would.  And so he joined Ashiepattle and his crew on theship.When they had sailed on some distance they met one who was standingholding his hand to his mouth."Who are you?" said Ashiepattle, "and what is the good of standingthere, holding your mouth like that?""Oh, I have seven summers and fifteen winters in my body," said theman; "so I think I ought to keep my mouth shut, for if they get out allat the same time they would finish off the world altogether."  And thenhe asked for leave to go with him in the ship."If you want to go with us you must make haste and get on board," saidAshiepattle.Yes, that he would, and then he joined the others on the ship.When they had sailed a long time they came to the king's palace.Ashiepattle went straight in to the king and said the ship stood readyin the courtyard outside; and now he wanted the princess, as the kinghad promised.The king did not like this very much, for Ashiepattle did not cut avery fine figure; he was black and sooty, and the king did not care togive his daughter to such a tramp, so he told Ashiepattle that he wouldhave to wait a little."But you can have her all the same, if by this time to-morrow you canempty my storehouse of three hundred barrels of meat," said the king."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle; "but perhaps you don't mindmy taking one of my crew with me?""Yes, you can do that, and take all six if you like," said the king,for he was quite sure that even if Ashiepattle took six hundred withhim, it would be impossible.  So Ashiepattle took with him the one whoate stones and always hungered after meat.When they came next morning and opened the storehouse they found he hadeaten all the meat, except six small legs of mutton, one for each ofhis companions.  Ashiepattle then went to the king and said thestorehouse was empty, and he supposed he could now have the princess.The king went into the storehouse and, sure enough, it was quite empty;but Ashiepattle was still black and sooty, and the king thought it wasreally too bad that such a tramp should have his daughter.  So he saidhe had a cellar full of beer and old wine, three hundred barrels ofeach kind, which he would have him drink first."I don't mind your having my daughter if you can drink them up by thistime to-morrow," said the king."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle, "but perhaps you don't mindmy taking one of my crew with me?""Yes, you may do that," said the king, for he was quite sure there wastoo much beer and wine even for all seven of them.  Ashiepattle tookwith him the one who was always sucking the bung and was alwaysthirsty; and the king then shut them down in the cellar.There the thirsty one drank barrel after barrel, as long as there wasany left, but in the last barrel he left a couple of pints to each ofhis companions.In the morning the cellar was opened and Ashiepattle went at once tothe king and said he had finished the beer and wine, and now hesupposed he could have the princess as the king had promised."Well, I must first go down to the cellar and see," said the king, forhe could not believe it; but when he got there he found nothing butempty barrels.But Ashiepattle was both black and sooty and the king thought itwouldn't do for him to have such a son in law.  So he said that ifAshiepattle could get water from the end of the world in ten minutesfor the princess's tea, he could have both her and half the kingdom;for he thought that task would be quite impossible."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle, and sent for the one of hiscrew who jumped about on one leg and had seven ton weights on theother, and told him he must take off the weights and use his legs asquickly as he could, for he must have water from the end of the worldfor the princess's tea in ten minutes.So he took off the weights, got a bucket, and set off, and the nextmoment he was out of sight.  But they waited and waited and still hedid not return.  At last it wanted but three minutes to the time andthe king became as pleased as if he had won a big wager.Then Ashiepattle called the one who could hear the grass grow and toldhim to listen and find out what had become of their companion."He has fallen asleep at the well"," said he who could hear the grassgrow; "I can hear him snoring, and a troll is scratching his head."Ashiepattle then called the one who could shoot to the end of the worldand told him to send a bullet into the troll; he did so and hit thetroll right in the eye.  The troll gave such a yell that he woke theman who had come to fetch the water for the tea, and when he returnedto the palace there was still one minute left out of the ten.Ashiepattle went straight to the king and said:  "Here is the water;"and now he supposed he could have the princess, for surely the kingwould not make any more fuss about it now.  But the king thought thatAshiepattle was just as black and sooty as ever, and did not like tohave him for a son-in-law; so he said he had three hundred fathoms ofwood with which he was going to dry corn in the bakehouse, and hewouldn't mind Ashiepattle having his daughter if he would first sit inthe bakehouse and burn all the wood; he should then have the princess,and that without fail."I suppose I must try," said Ashiepattle; "but perhaps you don't mindmy taking one of my crew with me?""Oh, no, you can take all six," said the king, for he thought it wouldbe warm enough for all of them.Ashiepattle took with him the one who had fifteen winters and sevensummers in his body, and in the evening he went across to thebakehouse: but the king had piled up so much wood on the fire that youmight almost have melted iron in the room.  They could not get out ofit, for no sooner were they inside than the king fastened the bolt andput a couple of padlocks on the door besides.  Ashiepattle then said tohis companion:"You had better let out six or seven winters, so that we may getsomething like summer weather here."They were then just able to exist, but during the night it got coldagain and Ashiepattle then told the man to let out a couple of summers,and so they slept far into the next day.  But when they heard the kingoutside Ashiepattle said:"You must let out a couple more winters, but you must manage it so thatthe last winter you let out strikes the king right in the face."He did so, and when the king opened the door, expecting to findAshiepattle and his companion burned to cinders, he saw them huddlingtogether and shivering with cold till their teeth chattered.  The sameinstant Ashiepattle's companion with the fifteen winters in his bodylet loose the last one right in the king's face, which swelled up intoa big chilblain."Can I have the princess now?" asked Ashiepattle"Yes, take her and keep her and the kingdom into the bargain," said theking, who dared not refuse any longer.  And so the wedding took placeand they feasted and made merry and fired off guns and powder.While the people were running about searching for wadding for theirguns, they took me instead, gave me some porridge in a bottle and somemilk in a basket, and fired me right across here, so that I could tellyou how it all happened.THE SQUIRE'S BRIDEBy P.  C.  AsbjörnsenONCE UPON a time there was a rich squire who owned a large farm, andhad plenty of silver at the bottom of his chest and money in the bankbesides; but he felt there was something wanting, for he was a widower.One day the daughter of a neighboring farmer was working for him in thehayfield.  The squire saw her and liked her very much, and as she wasthe child of poor parents he thought if he only hinted that he wantedher she would be ready to marry him at once.So he told her he had been thinking of getting married again."Aye!  one may think of many things," said the girl, laughing slyly.In her opinion the old fellow ought to be thinking of something thatbehooved him better than getting married."Well, you see, I thought that you should be my wife!""No, thank you all the same," said she, "that's not at all likely."The squire was not accustomed to be gainsaid, and the more she refusedhim the more determined he was to get her.But as he made no progress in her favor he sent for her father and toldhim that if he could arrange the matter with his daughter he wouldforgive him the money he had lent him, and he would also give him thepiece of land which lay close to his meadow into the bargain."Yes, you may be sure I'll bring my daughter to her senses," said thefather.  "She is only a child, and she doesn't know what's best forher."  But all his coaxing and talking did not help matters.  She wouldnot have the squire, she said, if he sat buried in gold up to his ears.The squire waited day after day, but at last he became so angry andimpatient that he told the father, if he expected him to stand by hispromise, he would have to put his foot down and settle the matter now,for he would not wait any longer.The man knew no other way out of it but to let the squire geteverything ready for the wedding; and when the parson and the weddingguests had arrived the squire should send for the girl as if she werewanted for some work on the farm.  When she arrived she would have tobe married right away, so that she would have no time to think it over.The squire thought this was well and good, and so he began brewing andbaking and getting ready for the wedding in grand style.  When theguests had arrived the squire called one of his farm lads and told himto run down to his neighbor and ask him to send him what he hadpromised."But if you are not back in a twinkling," he said, shaking his fist athim, "I'll-"He did not say more, for the lad ran off as if he had been shot at."My master has sent me to ask for that you promised him," said the lad,when he got to the neighbor, "but there is no time to be lost, for heis terribly busy to-day.""Yes, yes!  Run down into the meadow and take her with you.  There shegoes!" answered the neighbor.The lad ran off and when he came to the meadow he found the daughterthere raking the hay."I am to fetch what your father has promised my master," said the lad."Ah, ha!" thought she.  "Is that what they are up to?""Ah, indeed!" she said.  "I suppose it's that little bay mare of ours.You had better go and take her.  She stands there tethered on the otherside of the pea field," said the girl.The boy jumped on the back of the bay mare and rode home at fullgallop."Have you got her with you?" asked the squire."She is down at the door," said the lad."Take her up to the room my mother had," said the squire."But master, how can that be managed?" said the lad."You must just do as I tell you," said the squire.  "If you cannotmanage her alone you must get the men to help you," for he thought thegirl might turn obstreperous.When the lad saw his master's face he knew it would be no use togainsay him.  So he went and got all the farm tenants who were there tohelp him.  Some pulled at the head and the forelegs of the mare andothers pushed from behind, and at last they got her up the stairs andinto the room.  There lay all the wedding finery ready."Now, that's done master!" said the lad; "but it was a terrible job.It was the worst I have ever had here on the farm."Never mind, you shall not have done it for nothing," said his master."Now send the women up to dress her.""But I say master-!" said the lad."None of your talk!" said the squire.  "Tell them they must dress herand mind and not forget either wreath or crown.The lad ran into the kitchen."Look here, lasses," he said; "you must go upstairs and dress up thebay mare as bride.  I expect the master wants to give the guests alaugh."The women dressed the bay mare in everything that was there, and thenthe lad went and told his master that now she was ready dressed, withwreath and crown and all."Very well, bring her down!" said the squire.  "I will receive hermyself at the door," said he.There was a terrible clatter on the stairs; for that bride, you know,had no silken shoes on.When the door was opened and the squire's bride entered the parlor youcan imagine there was a good deal of tittering and grinning.And as for the squire you may he sure line had had enough of thatbride, and they say he never went courting again.THE DOLL IN THE GRASSBy P.  C.  AsbjörnsenONCE upon a time there was a king who had twelve sons.  When they weregrown up he told them they must go out into the world and findthemselves wives, who must all be able to spin and weave and make ashirt in one day, else he would not have them for daughters-in-law.  Hegave each of his sons a horse and a new suit of armor, and so they setout in the world to look for wives.When they had traveled a bit on the way they said they would not takeAshiepattle with them, for he was good for nothing.  Ashiepattle muststop behind; there was no help for it.  He did not know what he shoulddo or which way he should turn; he became so sad that he got off thehorse and sat down on the grass and began to cry.When he had sat a while one of the tussocks among the grass began tomove, and out of it came a small white figure; as it came nearerAshiepattle saw that it was a beautiful little girl, but she was sotiny, so very, very tiny.She went up to him and asked him if he would come below and pay a visitto the doll in the grass.Yes, that he would; and so he did.  When he came down below, the dollin the grass was sitting in a chair dressed very finely and lookingstill more beautiful.  She asked Ashiepattle where he was going andwhat was his errand.He told her they were twelve brothers, and that the king had given themeach a horse and a suit of armor, and told them to go out in the worldand find themselves wives, but they must all be able to spin and weaveand make a shirt in a day."If you can do that and will become my wife, I will not travel anyfarther," said Ashiepattle to the doll in the grass.Yes, that she would, and she set to work at once to get the shirt spun,woven, and made; but it was so tiny, so very, very tiny, no biggerthan-so!Ashiepattle then returned home, taking the shirt with him; but when hebrought it out he felt very shy because it was so small.  But the kingsaid he could have her for all that, and you can imagine how happy andjoyful Ashiepattle became.The road did not seem long to him as he set out to fetch his littlesweetheart.  When he came to the doll in the grass he wanted her to sitwith him on his horse; but no, that she wouldn't; she said she wouldsit and drive in a silver spoon, and she had two small while horseswhich would draw her.  So they set out, he on his horse and she in thesilver spoon; and the horses which drew her were two small white mice.Ashiepattle always kept to one side of the road, for he was so afraidhe should ride over her; she was so very, very tiny.When they had traveled a bit on the way they came to a large lake;there Ashiepattle's horse took fright and shied over to the other sideof the road, and upset the spoon, so that the doll in the grass fellinto the water.  Ashiepattle became very sad, for he did not know howhe should get her out again; but after a while a merman brought her up.But now she had become just as big as any other grown-up being and wasmuch more beautiful than she was before.  So he placed her in front ofhim on the horse and rode home.When Ashiepattle got there all his brothers had also returned, eachwith a sweetheart; but they were so ugly and ill-favored and bad-tempered that they had come to blows with their sweethearts on theirway home.  On their heads they had hats which were painted with tar andsoot, and this had run from their hats down their faces, so that theywere still uglier and more ill-favored to behold.When the brothers saw Ashiepattle's sweetheart they all became enviousof him, but the king was so pleased with Ashiepattle and his sweetheartthat he drove all the others away, and so Ashiepattle was married tothe doll in the grass; and afterward they lived happy and comfortablefor a long, long while; and if they are not dead, they must be stillalive.THE BEAR AND THE FOXBy P.  C.  AsbjörnsenOnce upon a time there was a bear, who sat on a sunny hillside taking anap.  Just then a fox came slinking by and saw him."Aha!  have I caught you napping, grandfather?  See if I don't play youa trick this time!" said Reynard to himself.He then found three wood mice and laid them on a stump of a tree justunder the bear's nose."Boo!  Bruin!  Peter the hunter is just behind that stump!" shouted thefox right into the bear's ear, and then took to his heels and made offinto the wood.The bear woke at once, and when he saw the three mice he became soangry that he lifted his paw and was just going to strike them, for hethought it was they who had shouted in his ear.But just then he saw Reynard's tail between the bushes and he set offat such a speed that the branches crackled under him, and Bruin wassoon so close upon Reynard that he caught him by the right hind legjust as be was running into a hole under a pine tree.Reynard was now in a fix; but he was not to be outwitted, and he cried:"Slip pine root, grip fox foot," and so the bear let go his hold; butthe fox laughed far down in the hole and said:"I sold you that time, also, grandfather!""Out of sight is not out of mind!" said the bear, who was in a finefury.The other morning, when Bruin came trudging across the moor with a fatpig, Master Reynard was lying on a stone by the moorside."Good-day, grandfather!" said the fox.  "What nice thing have you gotthere?""Pork," said the bear."I have got something tasty as well," said the fox."What's that?" said the bear."It's the biggest bees' nest I ever found," said Reynard."Ah, indeed," said the bear, grinning, and his mouth began to water, hethought a little honey would be so nice.  "Shall we change victuals?"he said."No, I won't do that," said Reynard.  But they made a wager aboutnaming three kinds of trees.  If the fox could say them quicker thanthe bear he was to have one bite at the pig; but if the bear could saythem quicker he was to have one suck at the bee's nest.  The bearthought he would be able to suck all the honey up at one gulp."Well said the fox, "that's all well and good but if I win you mustpromise to tear off the bristles where I want to have a bite," he said."Well, I suppose I must, since you are too lazy yourself," said thebear.Then they began to name the trees."Spruce, fir, pine," growled the bear.  His voice was very gruff.  Butall these were only different names of one kind of tree."Ash, aspen, oak," screeched the fox, so that the forest resounded.  Hehad thus won the bet, and so he jumped down, took the heart out of thepig at one bite, and tried to run off.  But the bear was angry, becausehe had taken the best bit of the whole pig, and seized hold of him byhis tail and held him fast."Just wait a bit," said the bear, who was furious."Never mind, grandfather; if you'll let me go you shall have a taste ofmy honey," said the fox.When the bear heard this he let go his hold and the fox jumped up onthe stone after the honey."Over this nest," said Reynard, "I'll put a leaf, and in the leaf thereis a hole, through which you can suck the honey."  He then put the nestright up under the bear's nose, pulled away the leaf, jumped on to thestone, and began grinning and laughing; for there was neither honey norhoneycomb in the nest.  It was a wasp's nest as big as a man's head,full of wasps, and out they swarmed and stung the bear in his eyes andears and on his mouth and snout.  He had so much to do with scratchingthem off him that he had no the to think of Reynard.Ever since the bear has been afraid of wasps.Once the fox and the bear made up their minds to have a field incommon.  They found a small clearing far away in the forest, where theysowed rye the first year."Now we must share and share alike," said Reynard; "if you will havethe roots I will have the tops," he said.Yes, Bruin was quite willing; but when they had thrashed the crop thefox got all the corn, while the bear got nothing but the roots andtares.Bruin didn't like this, but the fox said it was only as they hadagreed."This year I am the gainer," said the fox; "another year it will beyour turn; you can then have the tops and I will be satisfied with theroots."Next spring the fox asked the bear if he didn't think turnips would bethe right thing for that year."Yes, that's better food than corn," said the bear; and the fox thoughtthe same.When the autumn came the fox took the turnips, but the bear only gotthe tops.The bear then became so angry that he parted company then and therewith Reynard.One day the bear was lying eating a horse which he had killed.  Reynardwas about again and came slinking along, his mouth watering for a tastybit of the horseflesh.He sneaked in and out and round about till he came up behind the bear,when he made a spring to the other side of the carcass, snatching apiece as he jumped across.The bear was not slow either; he made a dash after Reynard and caughtthe tip of his red tail in his paw.  Since that time the fox has alwayshad a white tip to his tail."Wait a bit Reynard, and come here," said the bear, "and I'll teach youhow to catch horses."Yes, Reynard was quite willing to learn that, but he didn't trusthimself too near the bear."When you see a horse lying asleep in a sunny place," said the bear,"you must tie yourself fast with the hair of his tail to your brush,and then fasten your teeth in his thigh," he said.Before long the fox found a horse lying asleep on a sunny hillside; andso he did as the bear had told him; he knotted and tied himself well tothe horse with the hair of the tail and then fastened his teeth intohis thigh.Up jumped the horse and began to kick and gallop so that Reynard wasdashed against stock and stone, and was so bruised and battered that henearly lost his senses.All at once a hare rushed by.  "Where are you off to in such a hurry,Reynard?" said the hare."I'm having a ride, Bunny!" said the fox.The hare sat up on his hind legs and laughed till the sides of hismouth split right up to his ears, at the thought of Reynard having sucha grand ride; but since then the fox has never thought of catchinghorses again.That time it was Bruin who for once had the better of Reynard;otherwise they say the bear is as simple-minded as the trolls.THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WINDBy Sir George Webbe DasentOnce upon a time there was an old widow who had one son, and she waspoorly and weak, her son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal forcooking; but when he got outside the safe, and was just going down thesteps, there came the North Wind, puffing and blowing, caught up themeal, and so away with it through the air.  Then the lad went back intothe safe for more; but when he came out again on the steps, if theNorth Wind didn't come again and carry off the meal with a puff; andmore than that, he did so the third time.  At this the lad got veryangry; and as he thought it hard that the North Wind should behave so,he thought he'd just look him up and ask him to give up his meal.So off he went, but the way was long, and he walked and walked; but atlast he came to the North Wind's house."Good day!" said the lad, and "thank you for coming to see usyesterday.""GOOD DAY!" answered the North Wind, for his voice was loud and gruff,"AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME.  WHAT DO YOU WANT?""Oh!" answered the lad, "I only wished to ask you to be so good as tolet me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps, for wehaven't much to live on; and if you're to go on snapping up the morselwe have there'll be nothing for it but to starve.""I haven't got your meal," said the North Wind; "but if you are in suchneed, I'll give you a cloth which will get you everything you want, ifyou only say, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of gooddishes!'"With this the lad was well content.  But, as the way was so long hecouldn't get home in one day, he stopped at an inn on the way; and whenthey were going to sit down to supper, he laid the cloth on a tablewhich stood in the corner and said:"Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid; and all whostood by thought it a fine thing, but most of all the landlady.  So,when all were fast asleep, at dead of night, she took the lad's cloth,and put another in its stead, just like the one he had got from theNorth Wind, but which couldn't so much as serve up a bit of dry bread.So when the lad awoke, he took his cloth and went off with it, and thatday he got home to his mother."Now," said he, "I've been to the North Wind's house, and a good fellowhe is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, 'Cloth,spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes,' I get any sortof food I please.""All very true, I dare say," said his mother, "but seeing is believing,and I shan't believe it till I see it."So the lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, andsaid- "Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve"Well," said the lad, "there's no help for it but to go to the NorthWind again;" and away he went.So late in the afternoon he came to where the North Wind lived."Good evening!" said the lad."Good evening!" said the North Wind.  "I want my rights for that mealof ours which you took," said the lad; "for, as for that cloth I got,it isn't worth a penny.""I've got no meal," said the North Wind; "but yonder you have a ramwhich coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it-"'Ram, ram!  Make money!'"So the lad thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get homethat day, he stopped for the night at the same inn where he had sleptbefore.Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the NorthWind had said of the ram, and found it all right; but when the landlordsaw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when the lad had fallenasleep, he took another which couldn't coin gold ducats, and changedthe two.Next morning off went the lad; and when he got home to his mother, hesaid-"After all, the North Wind is a jolly fellow; for now he has givenme a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say, 'Ram, ram!  Makemoney!'""All very true, I dare say," said his mother; "but I shan't believe anysuch stuff until I see the ducats made.""Ram, ram!  Make money!" said the lad; but the ram made no money.So the lad went back again to the North Wind, and blew him up, and saidthe ram was worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal."Well," said the North Wind, "I've nothing else to give you but thatold stick in the corner yonder; but it's a stick of that kind that ifyou say- 'Stick, stick!  lay on!' it lays on till you say, 'Stick,stick!  now stop!'So, as the way was long the lad turned in this night, too, to thelandlord; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to thecloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore,as if he were asleep.Now the landlord, who easily saw that the stick must be worthsomething, hunted up one which was like it, and when he heard the ladsnore, was going to change the two, but just as the landlord was aboutto take it, the lad bawled out- "Stick, stick!  lay on!"So the stick began to beat the landlord till he jumped over chairs, andtables, and benches, and yelled and roared,- "Oh my!  oh my!  bid thestick be still, else it will beat me to death, and you shall have backyour cloth and your ram,When the lad thought the landlord had got enough, he said- "Stick,stick!  now stop!"Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket, and went home withhis stick in his hand, leading the ram by a cord round its horns; andso he got his rights for the meal he had lost.THE HUSBAND WHO WAS TO MIND THE HOUSEBy Sir George Webbe DasentONCE upon a time there was a man, so surly and cross, he never thoughthis wife did anything right in the house.  So one evening in haymakingtime, he came home, scolding and swearing, and showing his teeth andmaking a dust."Dear love, don't be so angry; there's a good man," said his goody;"to-morrow let's change our work.  I'll go out with the mowers and mow,and you shall mind the house at home."Yes, the husband thought that would do very well.  He was quitewilling, he said.So early next morning his goody took a scythe over her neck, and wentout into the hayfield with the mowers and began to mow; but the man wasto mind the house, and do the work at home.First of all he wanted to churn the butter; but when he had churned awhile, he got thirsty, and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel ofale.  So, just when he had knocked in the bung, and was putting the tapinto the cask, he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen.  Thenoff he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, as fast as hecould, to look after the pig, lest it should upset the churn; but whenhe got up, and saw that the pig had already knocked the churn over, andstood there, routing and grunting amid the cream which was running allover the floor, he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot his alebarrel and ran at the pig as hard as he could.  He caught it, too, justas it ran out of doors, and gave it such a kick that piggy lay for deadon the spot.  Then all at once he remembered he had the tap in hishand, but when he got down to the cellar, every drop of ale had run outof the cask.Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill thechurn again, and so he began to churn, for butter they must have fordinner.  When he had churned a bit, he remembered that their milkingcow was still shut up in the brye, and hadn't had a bit to eat or adrop to drink all the morning, though the sun was high.  Then all atonce he thought 'twas too far to take her down to the meadow, so he'djust get her up on the housetop-for the house, you must know, wasthatched with sods, and a fine crop of grass was growing there.Now their house lay close up against a steep down, and he thought if helaid a plank across to the thatch at the back he'd easily get the cowup.But still he couldn't leave the churn, for there was his little babecrawling about the floor, and "if I leave it," he thought, "the childis sure to upset it!"  So he took the churn on his back, and went outwith it; but then he thought he'd better first water the cow before heturned her out on the thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw water outof the well; but, as he stooped down at the well's brink, all the creamran out of the churn over his shoulders, and so down into the well.Now it was near dinner time, and he hadn't even got the butter yet; sohe thought he'd best boil the porridge, and filled the pot with water,and hung it over the fire.  When he had done that, he thought the cowmight perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck.  Sohe got up on the house to tie her up.  One end of the rope he made fastto the cow's neck, and the other he slipped down the chimney and tiedround his own thigh; and he had to make haste, for the water now beganto boil in the pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal.So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at it, down fell thecow off the housetop after all, and as she fell, she dragged the man upthe chimney by the rope.  There he stuck fast; and as for the cow, shehung halfway down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth, for shecould neither get down nor up.And now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for herhusband to come and call them home to dinner; but never a call theyhad.  At last she thought she'd waited long enough, and went home.  Butwhen she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place, sheran up and cut the rope in two with her scythe.  But as she did this,down came her husband out of the chimney; and so when his old dame cameinside the kitchen, there she found him standing on his head in theporridge pot.HOW ONE WENT OUT TO WOOBy Sir George Webbe DasentO NCE upon a time there was a lad who went out to woo him a wife.Among other places he came to a farmhouse, where the household werelittle better than beggars; but when the wooer came in they wanted tomake out that they were well to do, as you may guess.  Now the husbandhad got a new arm to his coat."Pray, take a seat," he said to the wooer; "but there's a shocking dustin the house."So he went about rubbing and wiping all the benches and tables with hisnew arm, but he kept the other all the while behind his back.The wife she had got one new shoe, and she went stamping and slidingwith it up against the stools and chairs saying, "How untidy it ishere!  Everything is out of place!"Then they called out to their daughter to come down and put things torights; but the daughter she had got a new cap; so she put her head inat the door, and kept nodding and nodding, first to this side and thento that."Well!  For my part, She said, I can't be everywhere at once."Aye!  Aye! That was a well-to-do household the wooer had come to.WHY THE BEAR IS STUMPY-TAILEDBy Sir George Webbe DasentONE day the Bear met the Fox, who came slinking along with a string offish he had stolen."Whence did you get these from?" asked the Bear."Oh! My Lord Bruin, I've been out fishing and caught them," said theFox.So the Bear had a mind to learn to fish too, and bade the Fox tell himhow he was to set about it."Oh! It's an easy craft for you", answered the Fox, "and soon learned.You've only got to go upon the ice, and cut a hole and stick your taildown into it; and so you must go on holding it there as long as youcan.  You're not to mind if your tail smarts a little; that's when thefish bite.  The longer you hold it there the more fish you'll get; andthen all at once out with it, with a cross pull sideways, and with astrong pull too."Yes; the Bear did as the Fox had said, and held his tail a long, longthe down in the hole, till it was fast frozen in.  Then he pulled itout with a cross pull, and it snapped short off.  That's why Bruin goesabout with a stumpy tail this very day.BOOTS WHO MADE THE PRINCESS SAY "THAT'S A STORY"By Sir George Webbe DasentONCE upon a time there was a King who had a daughter, and she was sucha dreadful storyteller that the like of her was not to be found far ornear.  So the King gave out, that if anyone could tell such a string oflies as would get her to say, "That's a story," he should have her towife, and half the kingdom besides.  Well, many came, as you may fancy,to try their luck, for everyone would have been very glad to have thePrincess, to say nothing of the kingdom; but they all cut a sorryfigure, for the Princess was so given to storytelling, that all theirlies went in at one ear and out of the other.  Among the rest camethree brothers to try their luck, and the two elder went first, butthey fared no better than those that had gone before them.  Last ofall, the third, Boots, set off and found the Princess in the farmyard."Good morning," he said, "and thank you for nothing."  "Good morning,"said she, "and the same to you."  Then she went on-"You haven't such a fine farmyard as ours, I'll be bound; for when twoshepherds stand, one at each end of it, and blow their ram's horns, theone can't hear the other.""Haven't we though!" answered Boots; "ours is far bigger; for when acalf starts to cross a field, it is a full-grown cow when it reachesthe other end.""I dare say," said the Princess.  "Well, but you haven't such a big ox,after all, as ours yonder; for when two men sit, one on each horn, theycan't touch each other with a tweny-foot rule.""Stuff!" said Boots; "is that all?  Why, we have an ox who is so big,that when two men sit, one on each horn, and each blows his greatmountain-trumpet, they can't hear one another.""I dare say," said the Princess; "but you haven't so much milk as we,I'll be bound; for we milk our cows into great pails, and carry themindoors, and empty them into great tubs, and so we make great, greatcheeses.""Oh!  you do, do you?" said Boots.  "Well, we milk ours into greattubs, and then we put them in carts and drive them indoors, and then weturn them out into great brewing vats, and so we make cheeses as big asa great house.  We had, too, a dun mare to tread the cheese welltogether when it was making; but once she tumbled down into the cheese,and we lost her; and after we had eaten at this cheese seven years, wecame upon a great dun mare, alive and kicking.  Well, once after that Iwas going to drive this mare to the mill, and her backbone snapped intwo; but I wasn't put out, not I; for I took a spruce sapling, and putit into her for a backbone, and she had no other backbone all the whilewe had her.  But the sapling grew up into such a tall tree, that Iclimbed right up to the sky by it, and when I got there I saw a ladysitting and spinning the foam of the sea into pigs'-bristle ropes; butjust then the spruce-fir broke short off, and I couldn't get downagain; so the lady let me down by one of the ropes, and down I slippedstraight into a fox's hole, and who should sit there but my mother andyour father cobbling shoes; and just as I stepped in, my mother gaveyour father such a box on the ear that it made his whiskers curl.""That's a story!" said the Princess, "my father never did any suchthing in all his born days!"So Boots got the Princess to wife, and half the kingdom besides.THE WITCH IN THE STONE BOATRetold by Andrew LangTHERE was once a king and queen, and they had a son called Sigurd, whowas very strong and active and good-looking.  When the king came to bebowed down with the weight of years he spoke to his son, and said thatnow it was time for him to look out for a fitting match for himself,for he did not know how long he might last now, and he would like tosee him married before he died.Sigurd was not averse to this and asked his father where he thought itbest to look for a wife.  The king answered that in a certain countrythere was a king who had a beautiful daughter, and he thought it wouldbe most desirable if Sigurd could get her.  So the two parted, andSigurd prepared for the journey and went to where his father haddirected him.He came to the king and asked his daughters hand, which was readilygranted him, but only on the condition that he should remain there aslong as he could, for the king himself was not strong and not very ableto govern his kingdom.  Sigurd accepted this condition, but added thathe would have to get leave to go home again to his own country when heheard news of his father's death.  After that Sigurd married theprincess and helped his father-in-law to govern the kingdom.  He andthe princess loved each other dearly, and after a year a son came tothem, who was two years old when word came to Sigurd that his fatherwas dead.  Sigurd now prepared to return home with his wife and childand went on board ship to go by sea.They had sailed for several days, when the breeze suddenly fell andthere came a dead calm at a time when they needed only one day's voyageto reach home.  Sigurd and his queen were one day on deck when most ofthe others on the ship had fallen asleep.  There they sat and talkedfor a while, and had their little son along with them.  After a timeSigurd became so heavy with sleep that he could no longer keep awake,so he went below and lay down, leaving the queen alone on the deckplaying with her son.A good while after Sigurd had gone below the queen saw something blackon the sea which seemed to be coming nearer.  As it approached shecould make out that it was a boat and could see the figure of some onesitting in it and rowing it.  At last the boat came alongside the ship,and now the queen saw that it was a stone boat, out of which there cameon board the ship a fearfully ugly witch.  The queen was morefrightened than words can describe, and could neither speak a word normove from the place so as to awaken the king or the sailors.  The witchcame right up to the queen, took the child from her, and laid it on thedeck; then she took the queen and stripped her of all her fine clothes,which she proceeded to put on herself and looked then like a humanbeing.  Last of all she took the queen, put her into the boat and said:"This spell I lay upon you, that you slacken not your course until youcome to my brother in the under world."The queen sat stunned and motionless, but the boat at once shot awayfrom the ship with her, and before long she was out of sight.When the boat could no longer be seen the child began to cry, andthough the witch tried to quiet it she could not manage it; so, withthe child on her arm, she went below to where the king was sleeping,and awakened him, scolding him for leaving them alone on deck while heand all the crew were asleep.  It was great carelessness of him, shesaid, to leave no one to watch the ship with her.Sigurd was greatly surprised to hear his queen scold him so much, forshe had never said an angry word to him before; but he thought it wasquite excusable in this case, and tried to quiet the child along withher but it was no use.  Then he went and wakened the sailors and badethem hoist the sails, for a breeze had sprung up and was blowingstraight toward the harbor.They soon reached the land which Sigurd was to rule over, and found allthe people sorrowful for the old king's death, but they became gladwhen they got Sigurd back to the court, and made him king over them.The king's son, however, hardly ever stopped crying from the time hehad been taken from his mother on the deck of the ship, although he hadalways been such a good child before, so that at last the king had toget a nurse for him-one of the maids of the court.  As soon as thechild got into her charge he stopped crying and behaved as well asbefore.After the sea voyage it seemed to the king that the queen had alteredvery much in many ways, and not for the better.  He thought her muchmore haughty and stubborn and difficult to deal with than she used tobe.  Before long others began to notice this as well as the king.  Inthe court there were two young fellows, one of eighteen years old, theother of nineteen, who were very fond of playing chess and often satlong inside playing at it.  Their room was next the queen's, and oftenduring the day they heard the queen talking.One day they paid more attention than usual when they heard her talk,and put their ears close to a crack in the wall between the rooms, andheard the queen say quite plainly: 'When I yawn a little, then I am anice little maiden: when I yawn halfway, then I am half a troll; andwhen I yawn fully then I am a troll altogether."As she said this she yawned tremendously, and in a moment had put onthe appearance of a fearfully ugly troll.  Then there came up throughthe floor of the room a three-headed giant with a trough full of meat,who saluted her as his sister and set down the trough before her.  Shebegan to eat out of it and never stopped till she had finished it.  Theyoung fellows saw all this going on, but did not hear the two of themsay anything to each other.  They were astonished, though, at howgreedily the queen devoured the meat and how much she ate of it, andwere no longer surprised that she took so little when she sat at tablewith the king.  As soon as she had finished it the giant disappearedwith the trough by the same way as he had come, and the queen returnedto her human shape.Now we must go back to the king's son after he had been put in chargeof the nurse.  One evening. after she had lit a candle and was holdingthe child, several planks sprang up in the floor of the room, and outat the opening came a beautiful woman dressed in white, with an ironbelt round her waist, to which was fastened an iron chain that wentdown into the ground.  The woman came up to the nurse, took the childfrom her, and pressed it to her breast; then she gave it back to thenurse and returned by the same way as she had come, and the floorclosed over her again.  Although the woman had not spoken a single wordto her, the nurse was very much frightened, but told no one about it.Next evening the same thing happened again, just as before, but as thewoman was going away she said in a sad tone, "Two are gone and one onlyis left," and then disappeared as before.  The nurse was still morefrightened when she heard the woman say this, and thought that perhapssome danger was hanging over the child, though she had no ill opinionof the unknown woman, who, indeed, had behaved toward the child as ifit were her own.  The most mysterious thing was the woman saying "andonly one is left"; but the nurse guessed that this must mean that onlyone day was left, since she had come for two days already.At last the nurse made up her mind to go to the king.  She told him thewhole story and asked him to be present in person the next day aboutthe time when the woman usually came.  The king promised to do so, andcame to the nurse's room a little before the time and sat down on achair with his drawn sword in his hand.  Soon after the planks in thefloor sprang up as before, and the woman came up, dressed in white,with the iron belt and chain.  The king saw at once that it was his ownqueen, and immediately hewed asunder the iron chain that was fastenedto the belt.  This was followed by such noises and crashings down inthe earth that all the king's palace shook, so that no one expectedanything else than to see every bit of it shaken to pieces.  At lastthe noises and shaking stopped, and they began to come to themselvesagain.The king and queen embraced each other, and she told him the wholestory-how the witch came to the ship when they were all asleep and senther off in the boat.  After she had gone so far that she could not seethe ship, she sailed on through darkness until she landed beside athree-headed giant.  The giant wished her to marry him, but sherefused; whereupon he shut her up by herself and told her she wouldnever get free until she consented.  After a time she began to plan howto get her freedom, and at last told him that she would consent if hewould allow her to visit her son on earth three days on end.  This heagreed to, but put on her this iron belt and chain, the other end ofwhich he fastened around his, own waist, and the great noises that wereheard when the king cut the chain must have been caused by the giant'sfalling down the underground passage when the chain gave way sosuddenly.  The giant's dwelling, indeed, was right under the palace,and the terrible shakings must have been caused by him in his deaththroes.The king now understood how the queen he had had for some time past hadbeen so ill-tempered.  He at once had a sack drawn over her head andmade her be stoned to death, and after that torn in pieces by untamedhorses.  The two young fellows also told now what they had heard andseen in the queen's room, for before this they had been afraid to sayanything about it, on account of the Queen's power.The real queen was now restored to all her dignity and was beloved byall.  The nurse was married to a nobleman and the king and queen gaveher splendid presents.THE SNUFFIBOXBy Paul SébillotAs often happens in this world, there was once a young man who spentall his time in traveling.  One day, as he was walking along, he pickedup a snuffbox.  He opened it, and the snuffbox said to him in theSpanish language:  "What do you want?"  He was very much frightened,but, luckily, instead of throwing the box away he only shut it tightand put it in his pocket.  Then he went on, away, away, away, and as hewent he said to himself, "if it says to me again, 'What do you want?' Ishall know better what to say this time."  So he took out the snuffboxand opened it, and again it asked: "What do you want?"  "My hat full ofgold," answered the youth, and immediately it was full.Our young man was enchanted.  Henceforth he should never be in need ofanything.  So on he traveled, away, away, away, through thick forests,till at last he came to a beautiful castle.  In the castle there liveda king.  The young man walked round and round the castle, not caringwho saw him, till the king noticed him and asked what he was doingthere.  "I was just looking at your castle."  "You would like to haveone like it, wouldn't you?"  The young man did not reply, but when itgrew dark he took out his snuffbox and opened the lid."  What do youwant?"  "Build me a castle with laths of gold and tiles of diamond andthe furniture all of silver and gold."  He had scarcely finishedspeaking when there stood in front of him, exactly opposite the king'spalace, a castle built precisely as he had ordered.  When the kingawoke he was struck dumb at the sight of the magnificent house shiningin the rays of the sun.  The servants could not do their work forstopping to stare at it.  Then the king dressed himself and went to seethe young man.  And he told him plainly that he was a very powerfulprince, and that he hoped that they might all live together in onehouse or the other, and that the king would give him his daughter towife.  So it all turned out just as the king wished.  The young manmarried the princess and they lived happily in the palace of gold.But the king's wife was jealous both of the young man and of her owndaughter.  The princess had told her mother about the snuffbox, whichgave them everything they wanted, and the queen bribed a servant tosteal the snuffbox.  They noticed carefully where it was put away everynight, and one evening, when the whole world was asleep, the womanstole it and brought it to her old mistress.  Oh, how happy the queenwas!  She opened the lid and the snuffbox said to her: "What do youwant?"  And she answered at once: "I want you to take me and my husbandand my servants and this beautiful house and set us down on the otherside of the Red Sea, but my daughter and her husband are to staybehind."When the young couple woke up they found themselves back in the oldcastle, without their snuffbox.  They hunted for it high and low, butquite vainly.  The young man felt that no time was to be lost, and hemounted his horse and filled his pockets with as much gold as he couldcarry.  On he went, away, away, away, but he sought the snuffbox invain all up and down the neighboring countries, and very soon he cameto the end of all his money.  But still he went on, as fast as thestrength of his horse would let him, begging his way.Some one told him that he ought to consult the moon, for the moontraveled far and might be able to tell him something.  So he went away,away, away, and ended, somehow or other, by reaching the land of themoon.  There he found a little old woman who said to him: "What are youdoing here?  My son eats all living things he sees, and if you are wiseyou will go away without coming any farther."  But the young man toldher all his sad tale, and how he possessed a wonderful snuffbox, andhow it had been stolen from him, and how he had nothing left now thathe was parted from his wife and was in need of everything.  And he saidthat perhaps her son, who traveled so far, might have seen a palacewith laths of gold and tiles of diamond and furnished all in silver andgold.  As he spoke these last words the moon came in and said hesmelled mortal flesh and blood.  But his mother told him that it was anunhappy man who had lost everything and had come all this way toconsult him, and bade the young man not to be afraid, but to comeforward and show himself.  So he went boldly up to the moon, and askedif by any accident he had seen a palace with the laths of gold and thetiles of diamond and all the furniture of silver and gold.  Once thishouse belonged to him, but now it was stolen.  And the moon said no,but that the sun traveled farther than he did, and that the young manhad better go and ask him.So the young man departed and went away, away, away, as well as hishorse would take him, begging his living as he rode along, and somehowor other at last he got to the land of the sun.  There he found alittle old woman, who asked him:  "What are you doing here?  Go away.Have you not heard that my son feeds upon Christians?"  But he said noand that he would not go, for he was so miserable that it was all oneto him whether he died or not; that he had lost everything, andespecially a splendid palace like none other in the whole world, for ithad laths of gold and tiles of diamond and all the furniture was ofsilver and gold; and that he had sought it far and long, and in all theearth there was no man more unhappy.  So the old woman's heart meltedand she agreed to hide him.When the sun arrived he declared that he smelled Christian flesh and hemeant to have it for his dinner.  But his mother told him such apitiful story of the miserable wretch who had lost everything and hadcome from far to ask his help that at last he promised to see him.So the young man came out from his hiding-place and begged the sun totell him if in the course of his travels he had not seen somewhere apalace that had not its like in the whole world, for its laths were ofgold and its tiles of diamond and all the furniture in silver and gold.And the sun said no, but that perhaps the wind had seen it, for heentered everywhere and saw things that no one else ever saw, and ifanyone knew where it was it was certainly the wind.Then the poor young man again set forth as well as his horse could takehim, begging his living as he went, and somehow or other he ended byreaching the home of the wind.  He found there a little old womanbusily occupied in filling great barrels with water.  She asked himwhat had put it into his head to come there, for her son ate everythinghe saw, and that he would shortly arrive quite mad, and that the youngman had better look out.  But he answered that he was so unhappy thathe had ceased to mind anything, even being eaten, and then he told herthat he had been robbed of a palace that had not its equal in all theworld, and of all that was in it, and that he had even left his wifeand was wandering over the world until he found it.  And that it wasthe sun who had sent him to consult the wind.  So she hid him under thestaircase, and soon they heard the south wind arrive, shaking the houseto its foundations.  Thirsty as he was, he did not wait to drink, buthe told his mother that he smelled the blood of a Christian man, andthat she had better bring him out at once and make him ready to beeaten.  But she bade her son eat and drink what was before him, andsaid that the poor young man was much to be pitied, and that the sunhad granted him his life in order that he might consult the Wind.  Thenshe brought out the young man, who explained how he was seeking for hispalace, and that no man had been able to tell him where it was, so hehad come to the Wind.  And he added that he had been shamefully robbed,and that the laths were of gold and the tiles of diamond, and all thefurniture in silver and gold, and he inquired if the Wind had not seensuch a palace during his wanderings.And the Wind said yes, and that all that day he had been blowingbackward and forward over it without being able to move one singletile.  "Oh, do tell me where it is," cried the young man."  "It is along way off," replied the Wind, "on the other side of the Red Sea."But our traveler was not discouraged-he had already journeyed too far.So he set forth at once, and somehow or other he managed to reach thatdistant land.  And he inquired if any one wanted a gardener.  He wastold that the head gardener at the castle had just left, and perhaps hemight have a chance of getting the place.  The young man lost no time,but walked up to the castle and asked if they were in want of agardener; and how happy he was when they agreed to take him!  Now hepassed most of his day in gossiping with the servants about the wealthof their masters and the wonderful things in the house.  He madefriends with one of the maids, who told him the history of thesnuffbox, and he coaxed her to let him see it.  One evening she managedto get hold of it, and the young man watched carefully where she hid itaway in a secret place in the bedchamber of her mistress.The following night, when everyone was fast asleep, he crept in andtook the snuffbox.  Think of his joy as he opened the lid!  When itasked him, as of yore, "What do you want?"  he replied: "What do Iwant?  What do I want?  Why, I want to go with my palace to the oldplace, and for the king and the queen and all their servants to bedrowned in the Red Sea."He had hardly finished speaking when he found himself back again withhis wife, while all the other inhabitants of the palace were lying atthe bottom of the Red Sea.THE GOLDEN BLACKBIRDBy Paul SébillotONCE upon a time there was a great lord who had three sons.  He fellvery ill, sent for doctors of every kind, even bonesetters, but theynone of them could find out what was the matter with him or even givehim any relief.  At last there came a foreign doctor, who declared thatthe golden blackbird alone could cure the sick man.So the old lord dispatched his eldest son to look for the wonderfulbird, and promised him great riches if he managed to find it and bringit back.The young man began his journey and soon arrived at a place where fourroads met.  He did not know which to choose, and tossed his cap in theair, determining that the direction of its fall should decide him.After traveling for two or three days he grew tired of walking withoutknowing where or for how long, and .he stopped at an inn which wasfilled with merrymakers and ordered something to eat and drink."My faith," said he, "it is sheer folly to waste more time hunting forthis bird.  My father is old, and if he dies I shall inherit hisgoods."The old man, after waiting patiently for some time, sent his second sonto seek the golden blackbird.  The youth took the same direction as hisbrother, and when he came to the crossroads he too tossed up which roadhe should take.  The cap fell in the same place as before, and hewalked on till he came to the spot where his brother had halted.  Thelatter, who was leaning out of the window of the inn, called to him tostay where he was and amuse himself."You are right," replied the youth.  "Who knows if I should ever findthe golden blackbird, even if I sought the whole world through for it?At the worst, if the old man dies we shall have his property."He entered the inn and the two brothers made merry and feasted, tillvery soon their money was all spent.  They even owed something to theirlandlord, who kept them as hostages till they could pay their debts.The youngest son set forth in his turn, and he arrived at the placewhere his brothers where still prisoners.  They called to him to stopand did all they could to prevent his going further."No," he replied, "my father trusted me, and I will go all over theworld till I find the golden blackbird.""Bah," said his brothers, "you will never succeed any better than wedid.  Let him die if he wants to.  We will divide the property."As he went his way he met a little hare, who stopped to looked at himand asked:"Where are you going, my friend ?""I really don't quite know," answered he.  "My father is ill, and hecannot be cured unless I bring him back the golden blackbird.  It is along time since I set out, but no one can tell me where to find it.""Ah," said the hare, "you have a long way to go yet.  You will have towalk at least seven hundred miles before you get to it.""And how am I to travel such a distance?""Mount on my back," said the little hare, "and I will conduct you."The young man obeyed.  At each bound the little hare went seven miles,and it was not long before they reached a castle that was as large andbeautiful as a castle could be."The golden blackbird is in a little cabin near by," said the littlehare, "and you will easily find it.  It lives in a little cage, withanother cage beside it made all of gold.  But whatever you do, be surenot to put it in the beautiful cage, or everybody in the castle willknow that you have stolen it."The youth found the golden blackbird standing on a wooden perch, but asstiff and rigid as if he was dead.  And beside, was the beautiful cage,the cage of gold."Perhaps he would revive if I were to put him in that lovely cage,"thought the youth.The moment the golden blackbird had touched the bars of the splendidcage he awoke and began to whistle, so that all the servants of thecastle ran to see what was the matter, saying that he was a thief andmust be put in prison."No," he answered, "I am not a thief.  If I have taken the goldenblackbird, it is only that it may cure my father, who is ill, and Ihave traveled more than seven hundred miles in order to find it.""Well," they replied, "we will let you go, and will even give you thegolden blackbird if you are able to bring us the porcelain maiden."The youth departed, weeping, and met the little hare, who was munchingwild thyme."What are you crying for, my friend?"  asked the hare."It is because," he answered, "the castle people will not allow me tocarry off the golden blackbird without giving them the porcelain maidenin exchange.""You have not followed my advice," said the little hare.  "And you haveput the golden blackbird into the fine cage.""Alas!  yes!""Don't despair.  The porcelain maiden is a young girl, beautiful asVenus, who dwells two hundred miles from here.  Jump on my back and Iwill take you there."The little hare, who took seven miles in a stride, was there in no timeat all, and he stopped on the borders of a lake."The porcelain maiden," said the hare to the youth, "will come here tobathe with her friends.  Keep yourself out of sight behind the thicket,while I just eat a mouthful of thyme to refresh me.  When she is in thelake be sure you hide her clothes, which are of dazzling whiteness, anddo not give them back to her unless she consents to follow you."The little hare left him, and almost immediately the porcelain maidenarrived with her friends.  She undressed herself and got into thewater.  Then the young man glided up noiselessly and laid hold of herclothes, which he hid under a rock at some distance.When the porcelain maiden was tired of playing in the water she cameout to dress herself, but though she hunted for her clothes high andlow she could find them nowhere.  Her friends helped her in the search,but, seeing at last that it was of no use, they left her alone on thebank, weeping bitterly."Why do you cry?"  said the young man, approaching her."Alas!"  answered she, "while I was bathing some one stole my clothes,and my friends have abandoned me.""I will find your clothes if you will only come with me."And the porcelain maiden agreed to follow him, and after having givenup her clothes the young man bought a small horse for her which wentlike the wind.  The little hare brought them both back to seek for thegolden blackbird, and when they drew near the castle where it lived thelittle hare said to the young man:"Now, do be a little sharper than you were before, and you will manageto carry off both the golden blackbird and the porcelain maiden.  Takethe golden cage in one hand and leave the bird in the old cage where heis, and bring that away too."The little hare then vanished.  The youth did as he was bid, and thecastle servants never noticed that he was carrying off the goldenblackbird.  When he reached the inn where his brothers were detained hedelivered them by paying their debt.  They set out all together, but asthe two elder brothers were jealous of the success of the youngest,they took the opportunity as they were passing by the shores of a laketo throw themselves upon him, seize the golden blackbird, and fling himin the water.  Then they continued their journey, taking with them theporcelain maiden, in the firm belief that their brother was drowned.But happily he had snatched in falling at a tuft of rushes and calledloudly for help.  The little hare came running to him and said: "Takehold of my leg and pull yourself out of the water."When he was safe on shore the little hare said to him:"Now, this is what you have to do: dress yourself like a Breton seekinga place as stableboy, and go and offer your services to your father.Once there, you will easily be able to make him understand the truth."The young man did as the little hare bade him, and he went to hisfather's castle and inquired if they were not in want of a stableboy."Yes," replied his father, "very much indeed.  But it is not an easyplace.  There is a little horse in the stable which will not let anyonego near it, and it has already kicked to death several people who havetried to groom it.""I will undertake to groom it," said the youth.  "I never saw the horseI was afraid of yet."The little horse allowed itself to be rubbed down without a toss of itshead and without a kick."Good gracious!"  exclaimed the master.  "How is it that he lets youtouch him when no one else can go near him?""Perhaps he knows me," answered the stableboy.Two or three days later the master said to him: "The porcelain maidenis here; but though she is as lovely as the dawn, she is so wicked thatshe scratches every one that approaches her.  Try if she will acceptyour services."When the youth entered the room where she was the golden blackbirdbroke forth into a joyful song, and the porcelain maiden sang too andjumped for joy."Good gracious!"  cried the master."  The porcelain maiden and thegolden blackbird know you too?""Yes," replied the youth, "and the porcelain maiden can tell you thewhole truth if she only will."Then she told all that had happened, and how she had consented tofollow the young man who had captured the golden blackbird."Yes," added the youth, "I delivered my brothers, who were keptprisoners in an inn, and as a reward they threw me into a lake.  So Idisguised myself and came here in order to prove the truth to you.So the old lord embraced his son and promised that he should inheritall his possessions, and he put to death the two elder ones, who haddeceived him and had tried to slay their own brother.The young man married the porcelain maiden and had a splendid weddingfeastTHE HALF-CHICKRetold by Andrew LangONCE upon a time there was a handsome black Spanish hen who had a largebrood of chickens.  They were all fine, plump little birds except theyoungest, who was quite unlike his brothers and sisters.  Indeed, hewas such a strange, queer-looking creature that when he first clippedhis shell his mother could scarcely believe her eyes, he was sodifferent from the twelve other fluffy, downy, soft little chicks whonestled under her wings.  This one looked just as if he had been cut intwo.  He had only one leg, and one wing, and one eye, and he had half ahead and half a beak.  His mother shook her head sadly as she looked athim and said:"My youngest born is only a half-chick.  He can never grow up a tall,handsome cock like his brothers.  They will go out into the world andrule over poultry yards of their own; but this poor little fellow willalways have to stay at home with his mother."  And she called him MedioPollito, which is Spanish for half-chick.Now, though Medio Pollito was such an odd, helpless-looking littlething, his mother soon found that he was not at all willing to remainunder her wing and protection.  Indeed, in character he was as unlikehis brothers and sisters as he was in appearance.  They were good,obedient chickens, and when the old hen chicked after them they chirpedand ran back to her side.  But Medio Pollito had a roving spirit inspite of his one leg, and when his mother called to him to return tothe coop, he pretended that he could not hear, because he had only oneear.When she took the whole family out for a walk in the fields, MedioPollito would hop away by himself and hide among the corn.  Many ananxious minute his brothers and sisters had looking for him, while hismother ran to and fro cackling in fear and dismay.As he grew older he became more self-willed and disobedient, and hismanner to his mother was often very rude and his temper to the otherchickens very disagreeable.One day he had been out for a longer expedition than usual in thefields.  On his return he strutted up to his mother with the peculiarlittle hop and kick which was his way of walking, and cocking his oneeye at her in a very bold way, he said:"Mother, I am tired of this life in a dull f farmyard, with nothing buta dreary maize-field to look at.  I'm off to Madrid to see the king.""To Madrid, Medio Pollito!" exclaimed his mother.  "Why, you sillychick, it would be a long Journey for a grown-up cock, and a poorlittle thing like you would be tired out before you had gone half thedistance.  No, no, stay at home with your mother, and some day, whenyou are bigger, we will go a little journey together."But Medio Pollito had made up his mind, and he would not listen to hismother's advice nor to the prayers and entreaties of his brothers andsisters."What is the use of our all crowding each other up in this poky littleplace?"  he said.  "When I have a fine courtyard of my own at theking's palace, I shall perhaps ask some of you to come and pay me ashort visit."And scarcely waiting to say good-by to his family, away he stumped downthe high road that led to Madrid."Be sure that you are kind and civil to every one you meet," called hismother, running after him; but he was in such a hurry to be off that hedid not wait to answer her or even to look back.A little later in the day, as he was taking a short cut through afield, he passed a stream.  Now, the stream was all choked up andovergrown with weeds and water-plants, so that its waters could notflow freely."Oh!  Medio Pollito," it cried as the half-chick hopped along itsbanks, "do come and help me by clearing away these weeds.""Help you, indeed!" exclaimed Medio Pollito, tossing his head andshaking the few feathers in his tail.  "Do you think I have nothing todo but to waste my time on such trifles?  Help yourself and don'ttrouble busy travelers.  I am off to Madrid to see the king," andhoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, away stumped Medio Pollito.A little later he came to a fire that had been left by some gypsies ina wood.  It was burning very low and would soon be out."Oh!  Medio Pollito," cried the fire in a weak, wavering voice as thehalf-chick approached, "in a few minutes I shall go quite out unlessyou put some sticks and dry leaves upon me.  Do help me or I shalldie!""Help you, indeed!"  answered Medio Pollito.  "I have other things todo.  Gather sticks for yourself and don't trouble me.  I am off toMadrid to see the king," and hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, away stumpedMedio Pollito.The next morning, as he was getting near Madrid, he passed a largechestnut tree, in whose branches the wind was caught and entangled."Oh!  Medio Pollito," called the wind, "do hop up here and help me toget free of these branches.  I cannot come away and it is souncomfortable.""It is your own fault for going there," answered Medio Pollito.  "Ican't waste all my morning stopping here to help you.  Just shakeyourself off, and don't hinder me, for I am off to Madrid to see theking," and hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, away stumped Medio Pollito ingreat glee, for the towers and roofs of Madrid were now in sight.  Whenhe entered the town he saw before him a great, splendid house, withsoldiers standing before the gates.  This he knew must be the king'spalace, and he determined to hop up to the front gate and wait thereuntil the king came out.  But as he was hopping past one of the backwindows the king's cook saw him."Here is the very thing I want," he exclaimed, "for the king has justsent a message to say that he must have chicken broth for his dinner."Opening the window he stretched out his arm, caught Medio Pollito, andpopped him into the broth pot that was standing near the fire.  Oh!how wet and clammy the water felt as it went over Medio Pollito's head,making his feathers cling to him."Water!  water!" he cried in his despair, "do have pity upon me and donot wet me like this.""Ah! Medio Pollito," replied the water, "you would not help me when Iwas a little stream away on the fields.  Now you must be punished."Then the fire began to burn and scald Medio Pollito, and he danced andhopped from one side of the pot to the other, trying to get away fromthe heat and crying out in pain:"Fire!  fire!  do not scorch me like this; you can't think how ithurts.""Ah! Medio Pollito," answered the fire, "you would not help me when Iwas dying away in the wood.  You are bei
